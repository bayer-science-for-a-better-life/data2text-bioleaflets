NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSuboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg sublingual tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach sublingual tablet contains 2 mg buprenorphine (as hydrochloride) and 0.5 mg naloxone (as \nhydrochloride dihydrate). \nExcipients with known effect:  \nEach sublingual tablet contains 42 mg lactose (as monohydrate) \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSublingual tablet \nWhite hexagonal biconvex tablets of 6.5 mm with \u201cN2\u201d debossed on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSubstitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and \npsychological treatment. The intention of the naloxone component is to deter intravenous misuse. \nTreatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be \ntreated for addiction. \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opiate \ndependence/addiction.  \n \nPrecautions to be taken before induction \nPrior to treatment initiation, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- \nor short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use and the degree of opioid dependence. To avoid \nprecipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine only should be \nundertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident (demonstrated e.g. by a score \nindicating mild to moderate withdrawal on the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, COWS).  \n\no For patients dependent upon heroin or short-acting opioids, the first dose of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than \n6 hours after the patient last used opioids. \n\no For patients receiving methadone, the dose of methadone should be reduced to a maximum of \n30 mg/day before beginning buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. The long half life of methadone \nshould be considered when starting buprenorphine/naloxone. The first dose of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be taken only when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less \nthan 24 hours after the patient last used methadone. Buprenorphine may precipitate symptoms \nof withdrawal in patients dependent upon methadone.  \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nInitiation therapy (induction) \nThe recommended starting dose in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age is one to two Suboxone \n2 mg/0.5 mg.  An additional one to two Suboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg may be administered on day one \ndepending on the individual patient\u2019s requirement.  \nDuring the initiation of treatment, daily supervision of dosing is recommended to ensure proper \nsublingual placement of the dose and to observe patient response to treatment as a guide to effective \ndose titration according to clinical effect.   \n \nDosage adjustment and maintenance therapy \nFollowing treatment induction on day one, the patient should be stabilised to a maintenance dose \nduring the next few days by progressively adjusting the dose according to the clinical effect of the \nindividual patient.  Dose titration in steps of 2-8 mg buprenorphine is guided by reassessment of the \nclinical and psychological status of the patient, and should not exceed a maximum single daily dose of \n24 mg buprenorphine.  \n \nLess than daily dosing  \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved the frequency of dosing may be decreased to \ndosing every other day at twice the individually titrated daily dose. For example, a patient stabilised to \nreceive a daily dose of 8 mg buprenorphine may be given 16 mg buprenorphine on alternate days, with \nno dose on the intervening days. In some patients, after a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, \nthe frequency of dosing may be decreased to 3 times a week (for example on Monday, Wednesday and \nFriday). The dose on Monday and Wednesday should be twice the individually titrated daily dose, and \nthe dose on Friday should be three times the individually titrated daily dose, with no dose on the \nintervening days. However, the dose given on any one day should not exceed 24 mg buprenorphine. \nPatients requiring a titrated daily dose> 8 mg buprenorphine /day may not find this regimen adequate. \n \nMedical withdrawal  \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, if the patient agrees, the dosage may be reduced \ngradually to a lower maintenance dose; in some favourable cases, treatment may be discontinued. The \navailability of doses of 2 mg/0.5 mg and 8 mg/2 mg allows for a downward titration of dosage. For \npatients who may require a lower buprenorphine dose, buprenorphine 0.4 mg may be used. Patients \nshould be monitored following medical withdrawal because of the potential for relapse. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in elderly patients over 65 years of age have not \nbeen established. No recommendation on posology can be made. \n \nHepatic impairment \nBaseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status is recommended prior to \ncommencing therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal products \n(see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at risk of accelerated liver injury. Regular \nmonitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4).  \nBoth active substances of Suboxone, buprenorphine and naloxone, are extensively metabolized in the \nliver, and the plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in patients \nwith moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms \nof precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of naloxone and/or \nbuprenorphine.  \nAs buprenorphine/naloxone pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment, \nlower initial doses and careful dose titration in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment are \nrecommended. Buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n(see section 4.3 and 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n4 \n\nModification of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose is not required in patients with renal impairment. \nCaution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in children below the age of 15 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nPhysicians must warn patients that the sublingual route is the only effective and safe route of \nadministration for this medicinal product (see section 4.4). The tablet is to be placed under the tongue \nuntil completely dissolved. Patients should not swallow or consume food or drink until the tablet is \ncompletely dissolved.  \n \nThe dose is made up from multiple Suboxone tablets of different strengths, which may be taken all at \nthe same time or in two divided portions; the second portion to be taken directly after the first portion \nhas dissolved.  \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n  \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSevere respiratory insufficiency \nSevere hepatic impairment  \nAcute alcoholism or delirium tremens. \nConcomitant administration of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) for the treatment of alcohol \nor opioid dependence. \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMisuse, abuse and diversion \nBuprenorphine can be misused or abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Some \nrisks of misuse and abuse include overdose, spread of blood borne viral or localised and systemic \ninfections, respiratory depression and hepatic injury. Buprenorphine misuse by someone other than the \nintended patient poses the additional risk of new drug dependent individuals using buprenorphine as \nthe primary drug of abuse, and may occur if the medicine is distributed for illicit use directly by the \nintended patient or if the medicinal product is not safeguarded against theft.  \n \nSub-optimal treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone may prompt medicine misuse by the patient, \nleading to overdose or treatment dropout. A patient who is under-dosed with buprenorphine/naloxone \nmay continue responding to uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms by self-medicating with opioids, \nalcohol or other sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines. \n \nTo minimize the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, physicians should take appropriate precautions \nwhen prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine, such as to avoid prescribing multiple refills early in \ntreatment, and to conduct patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring that is appropriate to the \npatient's needs.  \n \nCombining buprenorphine with naloxone in Suboxone is intended to deter misuse and abuse of the \nbuprenorphine. Intravenous or intranasal misuse of Suboxone is expected to be less likely than \nbuprenorphine alone since the naloxone in Suboxone can precipitate withdrawal in individuals \ndependent on heroin, methadone, or other opioid agonists.  \n \nRespiratory depression \nA number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported, particularly when \nbuprenorphine was used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5) or when \n\n\n\n5 \n\nbuprenorphine was not used according to prescribing information.  Deaths have also been reported in \nassociation with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such as alcohol or \nother opioids. If buprenorphine is administered to some non-opioid dependent individuals, who are not \ntolerant to the effects of opioids, potentially fatal respiratory depression may occur. \n \nThis product should be used with care in patients with asthma or respiratory insufficiency (e.g. chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, \npre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis (curvature of spine leading to potential shortness \nof breath)). \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and non-\ndependent persons in case of accidental or deliberate ingestion. Patients must be warned to store the \nblister safely, to never open the blister in advance, to keep them out of the reach of children and other \nhousehold members, and not to take this medicine in front of children. An emergency unit should be \ncontacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion of ingestion. \n \nCNS depression \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or \ncentral nervous system depressants (such as tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics) (see section 4.5). \n \nDependence \nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist at the \u00b5 (mu)-opiate receptor and chronic administration produces \ndependence of the opioid type.  Studies in animals, as well as clinical experience, have demonstrated \nthat buprenorphine may produce dependence, but at a lower level than a full agonist e.g. morphine.  \n \nAbrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in a withdrawal syndrome \nthat may be delayed in onset. \n \nHepatitis and hepatic events \nCases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent addicts both in clinical trials and \nin post marketing adverse reaction reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient \nasymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, \nhepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and death. In many cases the presence of pre-existing \nmitochondrial impairment (genetic disease, liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or \nhepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicines) \nand ongoing injecting drug use may have a causative or contributory role. These underlying factors \nmust be taken into consideration before prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone and during treatment. \nWhen a hepatic event is suspected, further biological and etiological evaluation is required. Depending \nupon the findings, the medicinal product may be discontinued cautiously so as to prevent withdrawal \nsymptoms and to prevent a return to illicit drug use. If the treatment is continued, hepatic function \nshould be monitored closely. \n \nPrecipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome  \nWhen initiating treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone, the physician must be aware of the partial \nagonist profile of buprenorphine and that it can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, \nparticularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid, or \nif administered less than 24 hours after the last dose of methadone. Patients should be clearly \nmonitored during the switching period from buprenorphine or methadone to buprenorphine/naloxone \nsince withdrawal symptoms have been reported. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be undertaken when objective signs of withdrawal are evident (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nWithdrawal symptoms may also be associated with sub-optimal dosing. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were \nevaluated in a post-marketing study.  Since both buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively \n\n\n\n6 \n\nmetabolized, plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in patients \nwith moderate and severe hepatic impairment after single-dose administration.  Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by \nincreased levels of naloxone and/or buprenorphine.  Suboxone sublingual tablets should be used with \ncaution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (See section 4.3 and 5.2). In patients with severe \nhepatic insufficiency the use of buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination may be prolonged since 30 % of the administered dose is eliminated by the renal \nroute. Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is \nrecommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nUse in adolescents (Age 15-<18) \nDue to the lack of data in adolescents (age 15-<18), patients in this age group should be more closely \nmonitored during treatment.  \n \nCYP 3A inhibitors \nMedicines that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 may give rise to increased concentrations of \nbuprenorphine. A reduction of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose may be needed. Patients already \ntreated with CYP3A4 inhibitors should have their dose of buprenorphine/naloxone titrated carefully \nsince a reduced dose may be sufficient in these patients (see section 4.5). \n \nGeneral warnings relevant to the administration of opioids  \nOpioids may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. \n \nOpioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures, so opioids should be used \nwith caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, other circumstances where cerebrospinal \npressure may be increased, or history of seizure. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral \nstenosis. \n \nOpioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, or changes in the perception of pain as a \nsymptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of \nconcomitant disease. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal cortical \ninsufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). \n \nOpioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, and should be used with caution in \npatients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. \n \nOpioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated patients. \n \nThe concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce an exaggeration of the \neffects of opioids, based on experience with morphine (see section 4.5). \n \nSuboxone contains lactose.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, should not \ntake this medicine. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSuboxone should not be taken together with: \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\uf0b7 alcoholic drinks or medicines containing alcohol, as alcohol increases the sedative effect of \nbuprenorphine (see section 4.7). \n\n \nSuboxone should be used cautiously when co-administered with: \n \n\no  benzodiazepines: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression of central \norigin. Therefore, dosages must be limited and this combination must be avoided in cases \nwhere there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be warned that it is extremely dangerous to \nself-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking this product, and should also be \ncautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this product only as directed by their \nphysician (see section 4.4). \n\n \no other central nervous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics \n\nand antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, \nanxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related substances: these \ncombinations increase central nervous system depression. The reduced level of alertness can \nmake driving and using machines hazardous. \n\n \no  Furthermore, adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full opioid \n\nagonist in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone. Therefore the potential to overdose with \na full agonist exists, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist \neffects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining.  \n\n \no naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects of \n\nbuprenorphine. Co-administration during buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is contraindicated \ndue to the potentially dangerous interaction that may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged \nand intense opioid withdrawal symptoms (see section 4.3). \n\n \no CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent \n\ninhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increased Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) of \nbuprenorphine (approximately 50 % and 70 % respectively) and, to a lesser extent, of \nnorbuprenorphine. Patients receiving Suboxone should be closely monitored, and may require \ndose-reduction if combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like \nritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir or azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, \nmacrolide antibiotics).  \n\n \no CYP3A4 inducers: Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with buprenorphine may decrease \n\nbuprenorphine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in sub-optimal treatment of opioid \ndependence with buprenorphine. It is recommended that patients receiving \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be closely monitored if inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered. The dose of buprenorphine or the \nCYP3A4 inducer may need to be adjusted accordingly.  \n\n \no the concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce exaggeration of \n\nthe effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Suboxone in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nTowards the end of pregnancy buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn infant \neven after a short period of administration. Long-term administration of buprenorphine during the last \nthree months of pregnancy may cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, neonatal \n\n\n\n8 \n\ntremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed for several \nhours to several days after birth. \n \nDue to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days should be considered \nat the end of pregnancy, to prevent the risk of respiratory depression or withdrawal syndrome in \nneonates.  \n \nFurthermore, the use of buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy should be assessed by the \nphysician. Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit \noutweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether naloxone is excreted in human breast milk. Buprenorphine and its metabolites \nare excreted in human breast milk. In rats buprenorphine has been found to inhibit lactation. \nTherefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with Suboxone. \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies have shown a reduction in female fertility at high doses (systemic exposure > 2.4 times \nthe human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 24 mg buprenorphine, based on AUC). \nSee section 5.3. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines \nwhen administered to opioid dependent patients. This product may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or \nimpaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If taken together with \nalcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced (see sections \n4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPatients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery in case \nbuprenorphine/naloxone may affect their ability to engage in such activities. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported treatment related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical \ntrials were constipation and symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, \nheadache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain). Some reports of seizure, vomiting, diarrhoea, and elevated \nliver function tests were considered serious. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 summarises adverse reactions reported from pivotal clinical trials in which, 342 of \n472 patients (72.5 %) reported adverse reactions and adverse reactions reported during post-marketing \nsurveillance.   \n \nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention:  \nVery common (\uf0b31/10), Common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100), Not known \n(cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nTable 1: Treatment-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing \nsurveillance of buprenorphine/naloxone \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not Known \n\nInfections and  Influenza Urinary tract  \n\n\n\n9 \n\ninfestations Infection \nPharyngitis \nRhinitis\n\ninfection \nVaginal infection \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n  Anaemia \nLeukocytosis \nLeukopenia \nLymphadenopathy \nThrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic \nshock \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Decreased appetite \nHyperglycaemia \nHyperlipidaemia \nHypoglycaemia\n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia \n \n\nAnxiety \nDepression \nLibido decreased \nNervousness \nThinking \nabnormal \n\nAbnormal dreams \nAgitation \nApathy \nDepersonalisation \nDrug dependence \nEuphoric mood \nHostility\n\nHallucination \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Migraine \nDizziness \nHypertonia \nParaesthesia \nSomnolence\n\nAmnesia \nHyperkinesia \nSeizure \nSpeech disorder \nTremor\n\nHepatic \nencephalopathy \nSyncope \n\nEye disorders  Amblyopia \nLacrimal disorder\n\nConjunctivitis \nMiosis\n\n \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n   Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders   Angina Pectoris \nBradycardia \nMyocardial \ninfarction \nPalpitations \nTachycardia\n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypertension \nVasodilatation\n\nHypotension Orthostatic \nhypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Cough Asthma \nDyspnoea \nYawning \n\nBronchospasm \nRespiratory \ndepression \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nConstipation \nNausea \n\nAbdominal Pain \nDiarrhoea \nDyspepsia \nFlatulence \nVomiting\n\nMouth ulceration \nTongue \ndiscolouration \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n   Hepatitis \nHepatitis acute \nJaundice \nHepatic necrosis \nHepatorenal \nsyndrome \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nHyperhidrosis Pruritus \nRash \nUrticaria \n\nAcne \nAlopecia \nDermatitis \nexfoliative\n\nAngioedema \n\n\n\n10 \n\nDry skin \nSkin mass\n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Back Pain \nArthralgia \nMuscle spasms \nMyalgia\n\nArthritis  \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Urine \nAbnormality \n \n\nAlbuminuria \nDysuria \nHaematuria \nNephrolithiasis \nUrinary retention \n\n \n\nReproductive \nsystem and breast \ndisorders \n\n Erectile \ndysfunction \n\nAmenorrhoea \nEjaculation \ndisorder \nMenorrhagia \nMetrorrhagia\n\n \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nDrug withdrawal \nsyndrome \n\nAsthenia \nChest Pain \nChills \nPyrexia \nMalaise \nPain \nOedema \nperipheral \n\nHypothermia \n \n\nDrug withdrawal \nsyndrome \nneonatal (see \nsection 4.6) \n\nInvestigations  Liver function test \nabnormal \nWeight decreased\n\nBlood creatinine \nincreased \n\nTransaminases \nincreased \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Injury Heat stroke  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nIn cases of intravenous drug misuse, some adverse experiences are attributed to the act of misuse \nrather than the medicinal product and include local reactions, sometimes septic (abscess, cellulitis), \nand potentially serious acute hepatitis, and other acute infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis \nhave been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nIn patients presenting with marked drug dependence, initial administration of buprenorphine can \nproduce a drug withdrawal syndrome similar to that associated with naloxone (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nRespiratory depression as a result of central nervous system depression is the primary symptom \nrequiring intervention in the case of overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Signs \nof overdose may also include somnolence, amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and/or \nspeech disorders. \n \nManagement \nGeneral supportive measures should be instituted, including close monitoring of respiratory and \ncardiac status of the patient.  Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression, and standard intensive \ncare measures, should be implemented. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation must be \nassured. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation facilities \nare available. \n \nIf the patient vomits, care must be taken to prevent aspiration of the vomitus. \n \nUse of an opioid antagonist (i.e., naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in \nreversing the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioid \nagents. \n \nIf naloxone is used, the long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration \nwhen determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an \noverdose. Naloxone can be cleared more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of \npreviously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms, so a continuing infusion may be necessary. \nIf infusion is not possible, repeated dosing with naloxone may be required.  Initial naloxone doses may \nrange up to 2 mg and be repeated every 2-3 minutes until a satisfactory response is achieved, \nbut should not exceed a 10 mg starting dose. Ongoing intravenous infusion rates should be titrated to \npatient response. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in addictive disorders, ATC \ncode: N07BC51. \n \nMechanism of action \nBuprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which binds to the \uf06d and \uf06b (kappa) opioid \nreceptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible \nproperties with the \uf06d-opioid receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of \naddicted patients for drugs. \n \nOpioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-dependent \npersons. \n \nNaloxone is an antagonist at \uf06d-opioid receptors. When administered orally or sublingually in usual \ndoses to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal, naloxone exhibits little or no pharmacological effect \nbecause of its almost complete first pass metabolism. However, when administered intravenously to \nopioid-dependent persons, the presence of naloxone in Suboxone produces marked opioid antagonist \neffects and opioid withdrawal, thereby deterring intravenous abuse. \n \nClinical efficacy \nEfficacy and safety data for buprenorphine/naloxone are primarily derived from a one-year clinical \ntrial, comprising a 4-week randomised double blind comparison of buprenorphine/naloxone, \nbuprenorphine and placebo followed by a 48 week safety study of buprenorphine/naloxone. In this \n\n\n\n12 \n\ntrial, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine/naloxone 16 mg \nper day, 16 mg buprenorphine per day or placebo. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, \ndosing began with 8 mg of buprenorphine on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg) of buprenorphine \non Day 2. On Day 3, those randomized to receive buprenorphine/naloxone were switched to the \ncombination tablet. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing and \nefficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. The primary study comparison \nwas to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone individually against placebo. \nThe percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples that were negative for non-study opioids was \nstatistically higher for both buprenorphine/naloxone versus placebo (p < 0.0001) and buprenorphine \nversus placebo (p < 0.0001). \n \nIn a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution to \na full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual solution \nof buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low enough \nto serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3 to10 day induction phase, a 16-week maintenance \nphase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; \nactive control doses were titrated more gradually. Based on retention in treatment and the percentage \nof thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than \nthe low dose of the control, in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in reducing their use of opioids \nwhile in treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine, 8 mg per day was similar to that of the \nmoderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBuprenorphine \n \nAbsorption \nBuprenorphine, when taken orally, undergoes first-pass metabolism with N-dealkylation and \nglucuroconjugation in the small intestine and the liver. The use of this medicinal product by the oral \nroute is therefore inappropriate. \n \nPeak plasma concentrations are achieved 90 minutes after sublingual administration. Plasma levels of \nbuprenorphine increased with the sublingual dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. Both Cmax and AUC of \nbuprenorphine increased with the increase in dose (in the range of 4-16 mg), although the increase was \nless than dose-proportional.  \n \nPharmacokinetic Parameter \n \n\nSuboxone 4 mg Suboxone 8 mg Suboxone 16 mg \n\nCmax ng/ml \n \n\n1.84 (39) 3.0 (51) 5.95 (38) \n\nAUC0-48   \nhour ng/ml \n\n12.52 (35) 20.22 (43) 34.89 (33) \n\n \nDistribution \nThe absorption of buprenorphine is followed by a rapid distribution phase (distribution half-life of 2 to \n5 hours). \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nBuprenorphine is metabolised by 14-N-dealkylation and glucuroconjugation of the parent molecule \nand the dealkylated metabolite. Clinical data confirm that CYP3A4 is responsible for the N-\ndealkylation of buprenorphine. N-dealkylbuprenorphine is a \uf06d-opioid agonist with weak intrinsic \nactivity. \n \nElimination of buprenorphine is bi- or tri-exponential, and has a mean half-life from plasma of \n32 hours.  \n\n\n\n13 \n\nBuprenorphine is eliminated in the faeces by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated metabolites \n(70 %), the rest being eliminated in the urine. \n \nNaloxone \n \nAbsorption and distribution  \nFollowing intravenous administration, naloxone is rapidly distributed (distribution half-\nlife ~ 4 minutes). Following oral administration, naloxone is barely detectable in plasma; following \nsublingual administration of buprenorphine/naloxone, plasma naloxone concentrations are low and \ndecline rapidly.  \n \nBiotransformation  \nThe medicinal product is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, and excreted \nin the urine. Naloxone has a mean half-life from plasma of 1.2 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients are available. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination plays a relatively small role (~30 %) in the overall clearance of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone. No dose modification based on renal function is required but caution is \nrecommended when dosing subjects with severe renal impairment (see Section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were \nevaluated in a post-marketing study.   \n \nTable 3 summarizes the results from a clinical trial in which the exposure after single-dose \nadministration of Suboxone 2.0/0.5mg (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual tablet was determined in \nhealthy subjects, and in subjects with hepatic impairment. \n \n\nTable 3.

No synergistic enhancement of toxicity has been \nobserved. Undesirable effects were based on the known pharmacological activity of opioid agonistic \nand/or antagonistic substances.  \n \nThe combination (4:1) of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride was not \nmutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test), and was not clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic \nassay in human lymphocytes or in an intravenous micronucleus test in the rat. \n \nReproduction studies by oral administration of buprenorphine: naloxone (ratio 1:1) indicated that \nembryolethality occurred in rats in the presence of maternal toxicity at all doses. The lowest dose \nstudied represented exposure multiples of 1x for buprenorphine and 5x for naloxone at the maximum \nhuman therapeutic dose calculated on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. No developmental toxicity was observed in \nrabbits at maternally toxic doses. Further, no teratogenicity has been observed in either rats or rabbits. \nA peri-postnatal study has not been conducted with buprenorphine/naloxone; however, maternal oral \nadministration of buprenorphine at high doses during gestation and lactation resulted in difficult \nparturition (possible as a result of the sedative effect of buprenorphine), high neonatal mortality and a \nslight delay in the development of some neurological functions (surface righting reflex and startle \nresponse) in neonatal rats. \n \nDietary administration of buprenorphine in the rat at dose levels of 500 ppm or greater produced a \nreduction in fertility demonstrated by reduced female conception rates. A dietary dose of 100 ppm \n(estimated exposure approximately 2.4x for buprenorphine at a human dose of 24 mg \nbuprenorphine/naloxone based on AUC, plasma levels of naloxone were below the limit of detection \nin rats) had no adverse effect on fertility in females. \n \nA carcinogenicity study with buprenorphine/naloxone was conducted in rats at doses of 7, 30 and \n120 mg/kg/day, with estimated exposure multiples of 3 to 75 times, based on a human daily sublingual \ndose of 16 mg calculated on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. Statistically significant increases in the incidence of \nbenign testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell adenomas were observed in all dosage groups.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSuboxone 8 mg/2 mg sublingual tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach sublingual tablet contains 8 mg buprenorphine (as hydrochloride) and 2 mg naloxone (as \nhydrochloride dihydrate).  \n \nExcipients with known effect:  \nEach sublingual tablet contains 168 mg lactose (as monohydrate) \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSublingual tablet \nWhite hexagonal biconvex tablets of 11 mm with \u201cN8\u201d debossed on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSubstitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and \npsychological treatment. The intention of the naloxone component is to deter intravenous misuse. \nTreatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be \ntreated for addiction. \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opiate \ndependence/addiction.  \n \nPrecautions to be taken before induction \n \nPrior to treatment initiation, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- \nor short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use and the degree of opioid dependence. To avoid \nprecipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine only should be \nundertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident (demonstrated e.g. by a score \nindicating mild to moderate withdrawal on the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, COWS).  \n\no For patients dependent upon heroin or short-acting opioids, the first dose of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than \n6 hours after the patient last used opioids. \n\no For patients receiving methadone, the dose of methadone should be reduced to a maximum of \n30 mg/day before beginning buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. The long half life of methadone \nshould be considered when starting buprenorphine/naloxone. The first dose of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be taken only when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less \nthan 24 hours after the patient last used methadone. Buprenorphine may precipitate symptoms \nof withdrawal in patients dependent upon methadone.  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nInitiation therapy (induction) \nThe recommended starting dose in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age is one to two Suboxone \n2 mg/0.5 mg.  An additional one to two Suboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg may be administered on day one \ndepending on the individual patient\u2019s requirement.  \nDuring the initiation of treatment, daily supervision of dosing is recommended to ensure proper \nsublingual placement of the dose and to observe patient response to treatment as a guide to effective \ndose titration according to clinical effect.   \n \nDosage adjustment and maintenance therapy \nFollowing treatment induction on day one, the patient should be stabilised to a maintenance dose \nduring the next few days by progressively adjusting the dose according to the clinical effect of the \nindividual patient.  Dose titration in steps of 2-8 mg buprenorphine is guided by reassessment of the \nclinical and psychological status of the patient, and should not exceed a maximum single daily dose of \n24 mg buprenorphine.  \n \nLess than daily dosing  \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved the frequency of dosing may be decreased to \ndosing every other day at twice the individually titrated daily dose. For example, a patient stabilised to \nreceive a daily dose of 8 mg buprenorphine may be given 16 mg buprenorphine on alternate days, with \nno dose on the intervening days. In some patients, after a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, \nthe frequency of dosing may be decreased to 3 times a week (for example on Monday, Wednesday and \nFriday). The dose on Monday and Wednesday should be twice the individually titrated daily dose, and \nthe dose on Friday should be three times the individually titrated daily dose, with no dose on the \nintervening days. However, the dose given on any one day should not exceed 24 mg buprenorphine. \nPatients requiring a titrated daily dose> 8 mg buprenorphine /day may not find this regimen adequate. \n \nMedical withdrawal  \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, if the patient agrees, the dosage may be reduced \ngradually to a lower maintenance dose; in some favourable cases, treatment may be discontinued. The \navailability of doses of 2 mg/0.5 mg and 8 mg/2 mg allows for a downward titration of dosage. For \npatients who may require a lower buprenorphine dose, buprenorphine 0.4 mg may be used. Patients \nshould be monitored following medical withdrawal because of the potential for relapse. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in elderly patients over 65 years of age have not \nbeen established. No recommendation on posology can be made. \n \nHepatic impairment \nBaseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status is recommended prior to \ncommencing therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal products \n(see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at risk of accelerated liver injury. Regular \nmonitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4).  \nBoth active substances of Suboxone, buprenorphine and naloxone, are extensively metabolized in the \nliver, and the plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in patients \nwith moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms \nof precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of naloxone and/or \nbuprenorphine.  \nAs buprenorphine/naloxone pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment, \nlower initial doses and careful dose titration in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment are \nrecommended. Buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n(see section 4.3 and 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n18 \n\nModification of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose is not required in patients with renal impairment. \nCaution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in children below the age of 15 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nPhysicians must warn patients that the sublingual route is the only effective and safe route of \nadministration for this medicinal product (see section 4.4). The tablet is to be placed under the tongue \nuntil completely dissolved. Patients should not swallow or consume food or drink until the tablet is \ncompletely dissolved.  \n \nThe dose is made up from multiple Suboxone tablets of different strengths, which may be taken all at \nthe same time or in two divided portions; the second portion to be taken directly after the first portion \nhas dissolved.  \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSevere respiratory insufficiency \nSevere hepatic impairment  \nAcute alcoholism or delirium tremens. \nConcomitant administration of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) for the treatment of alcohol \nor opioid dependence. \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMisuse, abuse and diversion \nBuprenorphine can be misused or abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Some \nrisks of misuse and abuse include overdose, spread of blood borne viral or localised and systemic \ninfections, respiratory depression and hepatic injury. Buprenorphine misuse by someone other than the \nintended patient poses the additional risk of new drug dependent individuals using buprenorphine as \nthe primary drug of abuse, and may occur if the medicine is distributed for illicit use directly by the \nintended patient or if the medicinal product is not safeguarded against theft.  \n \nSub-optimal treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone may prompt medicine misuse by the patient, \nleading to overdose or treatment dropout. A patient who is under-dosed with buprenorphine/naloxone \nmay continue responding to uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms by self-medicating with opioids, \nalcohol or other sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines. \n \nTo minimize the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, physicians should take appropriate precautions \nwhen prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine, such as to avoid prescribing multiple refills early in \ntreatment, and to conduct patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring that is appropriate to the \npatient's needs.  \n \nCombining buprenorphine with naloxone in Suboxone is intended to deter misuse and abuse of the \nbuprenorphine. Intravenous or intranasal misuse of Suboxone is expected to be less likely than \nbuprenorphine alone since the naloxone in Suboxone can precipitate withdrawal in individuals \ndependent on heroin, methadone, or other opioid agonists.  \n \nRespiratory depression \nA number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported, particularly when \nbuprenorphine was used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5) or when \n\n\n\n19 \n\nbuprenorphine was not used according to prescribing information.  Deaths have also been reported in \nassociation with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such as alcohol or \nother opioids. If buprenorphine is administered to some non-opioid dependent individuals, who are not \ntolerant to the effects of opioids, potentially fatal respiratory depression may occur. \n \nThis product should be used with care in patients with asthma or respiratory insufficiency (e.g. chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, \npre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis (curvature of spine leading to potential shortness \nof breath)). \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and non-\ndependent persons in case of accidental or deliberate ingestion. Patients must be warned to store the \nblister safely, to never open the blister in advance, to keep them out of the reach of children and other \nhousehold members, and not to take this medicine in front of children. An emergency unit should be \ncontacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion of ingestion. \n \nCNS depression \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or \ncentral nervous system depressants (such as tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics) (see section 4.5). \n \nDependence \nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist at the \u00b5 (mu)-opiate receptor and chronic administration produces \ndependence of the opioid type.  Studies in animals, as well as clinical experience, have demonstrated \nthat buprenorphine may produce dependence, but at a lower level than a full agonist e.g. morphine.  \n \nAbrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in a withdrawal syndrome \nthat may be delayed in onset. \n \nHepatitis and hepatic events \nCases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent addicts both in clinical trials and \nin post marketing adverse reaction reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient \nasymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, \nhepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and death. In many cases the presence of pre-existing \nmitochondrial impairment (genetic disease, liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or \nhepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicines) \nand ongoing injecting drug use may have a causative or contributory role. These underlying factors \nmust be taken into consideration before prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone and during treatment. \nWhen a hepatic event is suspected, further biological and etiological evaluation is required. Depending \nupon the findings, the medicinal product may be discontinued cautiously so as to prevent withdrawal \nsymptoms and to prevent a return to illicit drug use. If the treatment is continued, hepatic function \nshould be monitored closely. \n \nPrecipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome  \nWhen initiating treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone, the physician must be aware of the partial \nagonist profile of buprenorphine and that it can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, \nparticularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid, or \nif administered less than 24 hours after the last dose of methadone. Patients should be clearly \nmonitored during the switching period from buprenorphine or methadone to buprenorphine/naloxone \nsince withdrawal symptoms have been reported. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be undertaken when objective signs of withdrawal are evident (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nWithdrawal symptoms may also be associated with sub-optimal dosing. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were \nevaluated in a post-marketing study.  Since both buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively \n\n\n\n20 \n\nmetabolized, plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in patients \nwith moderate and severe hepatic impairment after single-dose administration.  Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by \nincreased levels of naloxone and/or buprenorphine.  Suboxone sublingual tablets should be used with \ncaution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (See section 4.3 and 5.2). In patients with severe \nhepatic insufficiency the use of buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination may be prolonged since 30 % of the administered dose is eliminated by the renal \nroute. Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is \nrecommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nUse in adolescents (Age 15-<18) \nDue to the lack of data in adolescents (age 15-<18), patients in this age group should be more closely \nmonitored during treatment.  \n \nCYP 3A inhibitors \nMedicines that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 may give rise to increased concentrations of \nbuprenorphine. A reduction of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose may be needed. Patients already \ntreated with CYP3A4 inhibitors should have their dose of buprenorphine/naloxone titrated carefully \nsince a reduced dose may be sufficient in these patients (see section 4.5). \n \n \n \nGeneral warnings relevant to the administration of opioids  \nOpioids may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. \n \nOpioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures, so opioids should be used \nwith caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, other circumstances where cerebrospinal \npressure may be increased, or history of seizure. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral \nstenosis. \n \nOpioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, or changes in the perception of pain as a \nsymptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of \nconcomitant disease. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal cortical \ninsufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). \n \nOpioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, and should be used with caution in \npatients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. \n \nOpioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated patients. \n \nThe concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce an exaggeration of the \neffects of opioids, based on experience with morphine (see section 4.5). \n \nSuboxone contains lactose.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, should not \ntake this medicine. \n \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSuboxone should not be taken together with: \n \n\uf0b7 alcoholic drinks or medicines containing alcohol, as alcohol increases the sedative effect of \n\nbuprenorphine (see section 4.7). \n \nSuboxone should be used cautiously when co-administered with: \n \n\no benzodiazepines: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression of central \norigin. Therefore, dosages must be limited and this combination must be avoided in cases \nwhere there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be warned that it is extremely dangerous to \nself-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking this product, and should also be \ncautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this product only as directed by their \nphysician (see section 4.4). \n\n \no other central nervous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics \n\nand antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, \nanxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related substances: these \ncombinations increase central nervous system depression. The reduced level of alertness can \nmake driving and using machines hazardous. \n\n \no  Furthermore, adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full opioid \n\nagonist in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone. Therefore the potential to overdose with \na full agonist exists, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist \neffects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining.  \n\n \no naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects of \n\nbuprenorphine. Co-administration during buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is contraindicated \ndue to the potentially dangerous interaction that may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged \nand intense opioid withdrawal symptoms (see section 4.3). \n\n \no CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent \n\ninhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increased Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) of \nbuprenorphine (approximately 50 % and 70 % respectively) and, to a lesser extent, of \nnorbuprenorphine. Patients receiving Suboxone should be closely monitored, and may require \ndose-reduction if combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like \nritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir or azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, \nmacrolide antibiotics). \n\n \no CYP3A4 inducers: Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with buprenorphine may decrease \n\nbuprenorphine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in sub-optimal treatment of opioid \ndependence with buprenorphine. It is recommended that patients receiving \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be closely monitored if inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered. The dose of buprenorphine or the \nCYP3A4 inducer may need to be adjusted accordingly.  \n\n \no the concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce exaggeration of \n\nthe effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine. \n \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Suboxone in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nTowards the end of pregnancy buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn infant \neven after a short period of administration. Long-term administration of buprenorphine during the last \nthree months of pregnancy may cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, neonatal \ntremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed from \nseveral hours to several days after birth. \n \nDue to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days should be considered \nat the end of pregnancy, to prevent the risk of respiratory depression or withdrawal syndrome in \nneonates. \n \nFurthermore, the use of buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy should be assessed by the \nphysician. Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit \noutweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether naloxone is excreted in human breast milk. Buprenorphine and its metabolites \nare excreted in human breast milk. In rats buprenorphine has been found to inhibit lactation. \nTherefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with Suboxone. \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies have shown a reduction in female fertility at high doses (systemic exposure > 2.4 times \nthe human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 24 mg buprenorphine, based on AUC). \nSee section 5.3. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines \nwhen administered to opioid dependent patients. This product may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or \nimpaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If taken together with \nalcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced (see sections \n4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPatients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery in case \nbuprenorphine/naloxone may affect their ability to engage in such activities. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported treatment related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical \ntrials were constipation and symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, \nheadache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain).

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nRespiratory depression as a result of central nervous system depression is the primary symptom \nrequiring intervention in the case of overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Signs \nof overdose may also include somnolence, amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and/or \nspeech disorders. \n \nManagement \nGeneral supportive measures should be instituted, including close monitoring of respiratory and \ncardiac status of the patient.  Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression, and standard intensive \ncare measures, should be implemented. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation must be \nassured. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation facilities \nare available. \n \nIf the patient vomits, care must be taken to prevent aspiration of the vomitus. \n \nUse of an opioid antagonist (i.e., naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in \nreversing the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioid \nagents. \n \nIf naloxone is used, the long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration \nwhen determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an \noverdose. Naloxone can be cleared more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of \npreviously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms, so a continuing infusion may be necessary. \nIf infusion is not possible, repeated dosing with naloxone may be required.  Initial naloxone doses may \nrange up to 2 mg and be repeated every 2-3 minutes until a satisfactory response is achieved, \nbut should not exceed a 10 mg starting dose. Ongoing intravenous infusion rates should be titrated to \npatient response. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in addictive disorders, ATC \ncode: N07BC51. \n \nMechanism of action \nBuprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which binds to the \uf06d and \uf06b (kappa) opioid \nreceptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible \nproperties with the \uf06d-opioid receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of \naddicted patients for drugs. \n \nOpioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-dependent \npersons. \n \nNaloxone is an antagonist at \uf06d-opioid receptors. When administered orally or sublingually in usual \ndoses to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal, naloxone exhibits little or no pharmacological effect \nbecause of its almost complete first pass metabolism. However, when administered intravenously to \n\n\n\n26 \n\nopioid-dependent persons, the presence of naloxone in Suboxone produces marked opioid antagonist \neffects and opioid withdrawal, thereby deterring intravenous abuse. \n \nClinical efficacy \nEfficacy and safety data for buprenorphine/naloxone are primarily derived from a one-year clinical \ntrial, comprising a 4-week randomised double blind comparison of buprenorphine/naloxone, \nbuprenorphine and placebo followed by a 48 week safety study of buprenorphine/naloxone. In this \ntrial, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine/naloxone 16 mg \nper day, 16 mg buprenorphine per day or placebo. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, \ndosing began with 8 mg of buprenorphine on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg) of buprenorphine \non Day 2. On Day 3, those randomized to receive buprenorphine/naloxone were switched to the \ncombination tablet. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing and \nefficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. The primary study comparison \nwas to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone individually against placebo. \nThe percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples that were negative for non-study opioids was \nstatistically higher for both buprenorphine/naloxone versus placebo (p < 0.0001) and buprenorphine \nversus placebo (p < 0.0001). \n \nIn a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution to \na full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual solution \nof buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low enough \nto serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3 to10 day induction phase, a 16-week maintenance \nphase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; \nactive control doses were titrated more gradually. Based on retention in treatment and the percentage \nof thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than \nthe low dose of the control, in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in reducing their use of opioids \nwhile in treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine, 8 mg per day was similar to that of the \nmoderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBuprenorphine \n \nAbsorption \nBuprenorphine, when taken orally, undergoes first-pass metabolism with N-dealkylation and \nglucuroconjugation in the small intestine and the liver. The use of this medicinal product by the oral \nroute is therefore inappropriate. \n \nPeak plasma concentrations are achieved 90 minutes after sublingual administration. Plasma levels of \nbuprenorphine increased with the sublingual dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. Both Cmax and AUC of \nbuprenorphine increased with the increase in dose (in the range of 4-16 mg), although the increase was \nless than dose-proportional.  \n \n \nPharmacokinetic Parameter \n \n\nSuboxone 4 mg Suboxone 8 mg Suboxone 16 mg \n\nCmax ng/ml \n \n\n1.84 (39) 3.0 (51) 5.95 (38) \n\nAUC0-48   \nhour ng/ml \n\n12.52 (35) 20.22 (43) 34.89 (33) \n\n \nDistribution \nThe absorption of buprenorphine is followed by a rapid distribution phase (distribution half-life of 2 to \n5 hours). \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \nBuprenorphine is metabolised by 14-N-dealkylation and glucuroconjugation of the parent molecule \nand the dealkylated metabolite. Clinical data confirm that CYP3A4 is responsible for the N-\ndealkylation of buprenorphine. N-dealkylbuprenorphine is a \uf06d-opioid agonist with weak intrinsic \nactivity. \n \nElimination of buprenorphine is bi- or tri-exponential, and has a mean half-life from plasma of \n32 hours.  \nBuprenorphine is eliminated in the faeces by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated metabolites \n(70 %), the rest being eliminated in the urine. \n \nNaloxone \n \nAbsorption and distribution:  \nFollowing intravenous administration, naloxone is rapidly distributed (distribution half-\nlife ~ 4 minutes). Following oral administration, naloxone is barely detectable in plasma; following \nsublingual administration of buprenorphine/naloxone, plasma naloxone concentrations are low and \ndecline rapidly.  \n \nBiotransformation  \nThe medicinal product is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, and excreted \nin the urine. Naloxone has a mean half-life from plasma of 1.2 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients are available. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination plays a relatively small role (~30 %) in the overall clearance of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone. No dose modification based on renal function is required but caution is \nrecommended when dosing subjects with severe renal impairment (see Section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were \nevaluated in a post-marketing study.   \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nTable 3 summarizes the results from a clinical trial in which the exposure after single-dose \nadministration of Suboxone 2.0/0.5mg (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual tablet was determined in \nhealthy subjects, and in subjects with hepatic impairment. \n \n\nTable 3.

No synergistic enhancement of toxicity has been \nobserved. Undesirable effects were based on the known pharmacological activity of opioid agonistic \nand/or antagonistic substances.  \n \nThe combination (4:1) of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride was not \nmutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test), and was not clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic \nassay in human lymphocytes or in an intravenous micronucleus test in the rat. \n \nReproduction studies by oral administration of buprenorphine: naloxone (ratio 1:1) indicated that \nembryolethality occurred in rats in the presence of maternal toxicity at all doses. The lowest dose \nstudied represented exposure multiples of 1x for buprenorphine and 5x for naloxone at the maximum \nhuman therapeutic dose calculated on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. No developmental toxicity was observed in \nrabbits at maternally toxic doses. Further, no teratogenicity has been observed in either rats or rabbits. \nA peri-postnatal study has not been conducted with buprenorphine/naloxone; however, maternal oral \nadministration of buprenorphine at high doses during gestation and lactation resulted in difficult \nparturition (possible as a result of the sedative effect of buprenorphine), high neonatal mortality and a \nslight delay in the development of some neurological functions (surface righting reflex and startle \nresponse) in neonatal rats. \n \nDietary administration of buprenorphine in the rat at dose levels of 500 ppm or greater produced a \nreduction in fertility demonstrated by reduced female conception rates. A dietary dose of 100 ppm \n(estimated exposure approximately 2.4x for buprenorphine at a human dose of 24 mg \n\n\n\n29 \n\nbuprenorphine/naloxone based on AUC, plasma levels of naloxone were below the limit of detection \nin rats) had no adverse effect on fertility in females. \n \nA carcinogenicity study with buprenorphine/naloxone was conducted in rats at doses of 7, 30 and \n120 mg/kg/day, with estimated exposure multiples of 3 to 75 times, based on a human daily sublingual \ndose of 16 mg calculated on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. Statistically significant increases in the incidence of \nbenign testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell adenomas were observed in all dosage groups.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach sublingual tablet contains 16 mg buprenorphine (as hydrochloride) and 4 mg naloxone (as \nhydrochloride dihydrate). \n \nExcipients with known effect:  \nEach sublingual tablet contains 156.64 mg lactose (as monohydrate) \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSublingual tablet \nWhite round biconvex tablets of 10.5 mm with \u201cN16\u201d debossed on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSubstitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and \npsychological treatment. The intention of the naloxone component is to deter intravenous misuse. \nTreatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be \ntreated for addiction. \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opiate \ndependence/addiction.  \n \nPrecautions to be taken before induction \nPrior to treatment initiation, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- \nor short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use and the degree of opioid dependence. To avoid \nprecipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine only should be \nundertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident (demonstrated e.g. by a score \nindicating mild to moderate withdrawal on the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, COWS).  \n\no For patients dependent upon heroin or short-acting opioids, the first dose of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than \n6 hours after the patient last used opioids. \n\no For patients receiving methadone, the dose of methadone should be reduced to a maximum of \n30 mg/day before beginning buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. The long half life of methadone \nshould be considered when starting buprenorphine/naloxone. The first dose of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be taken only when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less \nthan 24 hours after the patient last used methadone. Buprenorphine may precipitate symptoms \nof withdrawal in patients dependent upon methadone.  \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPosology \n \nInitiation therapy (induction) \nThe recommended starting dose in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age is one to two Suboxone \n2 mg/0.5 mg.  An additional one to two Suboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg may be administered on day one \ndepending on the individual patient\u2019s requirement.  \nDuring the initiation of treatment, daily supervision of dosing is recommended to ensure proper \nsublingual placement of the dose and to observe patient response to treatment as a guide to effective \ndose titration according to clinical effect.   \n \nDosage adjustment and maintenance therapy \nFollowing treatment induction on day one, the patient should be stabilised to a maintenance dose \nduring the next few days by progressively adjusting the dose according to the clinical effect of the \nindividual patient.  Dose titration in steps of 2-8 mg buprenorphine is guided by reassessment of the \nclinical and psychological status of the patient, and should not exceed a maximum single daily dose of \n24 mg buprenorphine.  \n \nLess than daily dosing  \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved the frequency of dosing may be decreased to \ndosing every other day at twice the individually titrated daily dose. For example, a patient stabilised to \nreceive a daily dose of 8 mg buprenorphine may be given 16 mg buprenorphine on alternate days, with \nno dose on the intervening days. In some patients, after a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, \nthe frequency of dosing may be decreased to 3 times a week (for example on Monday, Wednesday and \nFriday). The dose on Monday and Wednesday should be twice the individually titrated daily dose, and \nthe dose on Friday should be three times the individually titrated daily dose, with no dose on the \nintervening days. However, the dose given on any one day should not exceed 24 mg buprenorphine. \nPatients requiring a titrated daily dose> 8 mg buprenorphine/day may not find this regimen adequate. \n \nMedical withdrawal  \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, if the patient agrees, the dosage may be reduced \ngradually to a lower maintenance dose; in some favourable cases, treatment may be discontinued. The \navailability of doses of 2 mg/0.5 mg and 8 mg/2 mg allows for a downward titration of dosage. For \npatients who may require a lower buprenorphine dose, buprenorphine 0.4 mg may be used. Patients \nshould be monitored following medical withdrawal because of the potential for relapse. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in elderly patients over 65 years of age have not \nbeen established. No recommendation on posology can be made. \n \nHepatic impairment \nBaseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status is recommended prior to \ncommencing therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal products \n(see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at risk of accelerated liver injury. Regular \nmonitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4).  \nBoth active substances of Suboxone, buprenorphine and naloxone, are extensively metabolized in the \nliver, and the plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone  in patients \nwith moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms \nof precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of naloxone and/or \nbuprenorphine.  \nAs buprenorphine/naloxone pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment, \nlower initial doses and careful dose titration in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment are \nrecommended. Buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(see section 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n33 \n\nModification of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose is not required in patients with renal impairment. \nCaution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in children below the age of 15 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nPhysicians must warn patients that the sublingual route is the only effective and safe route of \nadministration for this medicinal product (see section 4.4). The tablet is to be placed under the tongue \nuntil completely dissolved. Patients should not swallow or consume food or drink until the tablet is \ncompletely dissolved.  \n \nThe dose can be made up from  multiple Suboxone tablets of different strengths, which may be taken \nall at the same time or in two divided portions; the second portion to be taken directly after the first \nportion has dissolved. \n  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n  \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSevere respiratory insufficiency \nSevere hepatic impairment  \nAcute alcoholism or delirium tremens. \nConcomitant administration of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) for the treatment of alcohol \nor opioid dependence. \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMisuse, abuse and diversion \nBuprenorphine can be misused or abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Some \nrisks of misuse and abuse include overdose, spread of blood borne viral or localised and systemic \ninfections, respiratory depression and hepatic injury. Buprenorphine misuse by someone other than the \nintended patient poses the additional risk of new drug dependent individuals using buprenorphine as \nthe primary drug of abuse, and may occur if the medicine is distributed for illicit use directly by the \nintended patient or if the medicinal product is not safeguarded against theft.  \n \nSub-optimal treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone may prompt medicine misuse by the patient, \nleading to overdose or treatment dropout. A patient who is under-dosed with buprenorphine/naloxone \nmay continue responding to uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms by self-medicating with opioids, \nalcohol or other sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines. \n \nTo minimize the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, physicians should take appropriate precautions \nwhen prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine, such as to avoid prescribing multiple refills early in \ntreatment, and to conduct patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring that is appropriate to the \npatient's needs.  \n \nCombining buprenorphine with naloxone in Suboxone is intended to deter misuse and abuse of the \nbuprenorphine. Intravenous or intranasal misuse of Suboxone is expected to be less likely than \nbuprenorphine alone since the naloxone in Suboxone can precipitate withdrawal in individuals \ndependent on heroin, methadone, or other opioid agonists.  \n \nRespiratory depression \nA number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported, particularly when \nbuprenorphine was used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5) or when \n\n\n\n34 \n\nbuprenorphine was not used according to prescribing information.  Deaths have also been reported in \nassociation with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such as alcohol or \nother opioids. If buprenorphine is administered to some non-opioid dependent individuals, who are not \ntolerant to the effects of opioids, potentially fatal respiratory depression may occur. \n \nThis product should be used with care in patients with asthma or respiratory insufficiency (e.g. chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, \npre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis (curvature of spine leading to potential shortness \nof breath)). \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and non-\ndependent persons in case of accidental or deliberate ingestion. Patients must be warned to store the \nblister safely, to never open the blister in advance, to keep them out of the reach of children and other \nhousehold members, and not to take this medicine in front of children. An emergency unit should be \ncontacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion of ingestion. \n \nCNS depression \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or \ncentral nervous system depressants (such as tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics) (see section 4.5). \n \nDependence \nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist at the \u00b5 (mu)-opiate receptor and chronic administration produces \ndependence of the opioid type.  Studies in animals, as well as clinical experience, have demonstrated \nthat buprenorphine may produce dependence, but at a lower level than a full agonist e.g. morphine.  \n \nAbrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in a withdrawal syndrome \nthat may be delayed in onset. \n \nHepatitis and hepatic events \nCases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent addicts both in clinical trials and \nin post marketing adverse reaction reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient \nasymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, \nhepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and death. In many cases the presence of pre-existing \nmitochondrial impairment (genetic disease, liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or \nhepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicines) \nand ongoing injecting drug use may have a causative or contributory role. These underlying factors \nmust be taken into consideration before prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone and during treatment. \nWhen a hepatic event is suspected, further biological and etiological evaluation is required. Depending \nupon the findings, the medicinal product may be discontinued cautiously so as to prevent withdrawal \nsymptoms and to prevent a return to illicit drug use. If the treatment is continued, hepatic function \nshould be monitored closely. \n \nPrecipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome  \nWhen initiating treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone, the physician must be aware of the partial \nagonist profile of buprenorphine and that it can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, \nparticularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid, or \nif administered less than 24 hours after the last dose of methadone. Patients should be clearly \nmonitored during the switching period from buprenorphine or methadone to buprenorphine/naloxone \nsince withdrawal symptoms have been reported. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be undertaken when objective signs of withdrawal are evident (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nWithdrawal symptoms may also be associated with sub-optimal dosing. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were \nevaluated in a post-marketing study.  Since both buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively \n\n\n\n35 \n\nmetabolized, plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in patients \nwith moderate and severe hepatic impairment after single-dose administration.  Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by \nincreased levels of naloxone and/or buprenorphine.  Suboxone sublingual tablets should be used with \ncaution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (See section 4.3 and 5.2). In patients with severe \nhepatic insufficiency the use of buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination may be prolonged since 30 % of the administered dose is eliminated by the renal \nroute. Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is \nrecommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nUse in adolescents (Age 15-<18) \nDue to the lack of data in adolescents (age 15-<18), patients in this age group should be more closely \nmonitored during treatment.  \n \nCYP 3A inhibitors \nMedicines that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 may give rise to increased concentrations of \nbuprenorphine. A reduction of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose may be needed. Patients already \ntreated with CYP3A4 inhibitors should have their dose of buprenorphine/naloxone titrated carefully \nsince a reduced dose may be sufficient in these patients (see section 4.5). \n \nGeneral warnings relevant to the administration of opioids  \nOpioids may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. \n \nOpioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures, so opioids should be used \nwith caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, other circumstances where cerebrospinal \npressure may be increased, or history of seizure. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral \nstenosis. \n \nOpioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, or changes in the perception of pain as a \nsymptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of \nconcomitant disease. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal cortical \ninsufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). \n \nOpioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, and should be used with caution in \npatients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. \n \nOpioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated patients. \n \nThe concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce an exaggeration of the \neffects of opioids, based on experience with morphine (see section 4.5). \n \nSuboxone contains lactose.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, should not \ntake this medicine. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSuboxone should not be taken together with: \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n\uf0b7 alcoholic drinks or medicines containing alcohol, as alcohol increases the sedative effect of \nbuprenorphine (see section 4.7). \n\n \nSuboxone should be used cautiously when co-administered with: \n \n\no  benzodiazepines: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression of central \norigin. Therefore, dosages must be limited and this combination must be avoided in cases \nwhere there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be warned that it is extremely dangerous to \nself-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking this product, and should also be \ncautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this product only as directed by their \nphysician (see section 4.4). \n\n \no other central nervous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics \n\nand antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, \nanxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related substances: these \ncombinations increase central nervous system depression. The reduced level of alertness can \nmake driving and using machines hazardous. \n\n \no  Furthermore, adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full opioid \n\nagonist in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone. Therefore the potential to overdose with \na full agonist exists, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist \neffects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining.  \n\n \no naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects of \n\nbuprenorphine. Co-administration during buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is contraindicated \ndue to the potentially dangerous interaction that may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged \nand intense opioid withdrawal symptoms (see section 4.3). \n\n \no CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent \n\ninhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increased Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) of \nbuprenorphine (approximately 50 % and 70 % respectively) and, to a lesser extent, of \nnorbuprenorphine. Patients receiving Suboxone should be closely monitored, and may require \ndose-reduction if combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like \nritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir or azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, \nmacrolide antibiotics).  \n\n \no CYP3A4 inducers: Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with buprenorphine may decrease \n\nbuprenorphine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in sub-optimal treatment of opioid \ndependence with buprenorphine. It is recommended that patients receiving \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be closely monitored if inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered. The dose of buprenorphine or the \nCYP3A4 inducer may need to be adjusted accordingly.  \n\n \no the concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce exaggeration of \n\nthe effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Suboxone in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nTowards the end of pregnancy buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn infant \neven after a short period of administration. Long-term administration of buprenorphine during the last \nthree months of pregnancy may cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, neonatal \n\n\n\n37 \n\ntremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed for several \nhours to several days after birth. \n \nDue to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days should be considered \nat the end of pregnancy, to prevent the risk of respiratory depression or withdrawal syndrome in \nneonates.  \n \nFurthermore, the use of buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy should be assessed by the \nphysician. Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit \noutweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether naloxone is excreted in human breast milk. Buprenorphine and its metabolites \nare excreted in human breast milk. In rats buprenorphine has been found to inhibit lactation. \nTherefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with Suboxone. \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies have shown a reduction in female fertility at high doses (systemic exposure > 2.4 times \nthe human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 24 mg buprenorphine, based on AUC). \nSee section 5.3. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines \nwhen administered to opioid dependent patients. This product may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or \nimpaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If taken together with \nalcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced (see sections \n4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPatients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery in case \nbuprenorphine/naloxone may affect their ability to engage in such activities. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported treatment related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical \ntrials were constipation and symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, \nheadache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain). Some reports of seizure, vomiting, diarrhoea, and elevated \nliver function tests were considered serious. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 summarises adverse reactions reported from pivotal clinical trials in which, 342 of \n472 patients (72.5 %) reported adverse reactions and adverse reactions reported during post-marketing \nsurveillance.   \n \nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention:  \nVery common (\uf0b31/10), Common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100), Not known \n(cannot be estimated from available data). \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \nTable 1: Treatment-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post- marketing \nsurveillance of buprenorphine/naloxone \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Influenza \nInfection \nPharyngitis \nRhinitis\n\nUrinary tract \ninfection \nVaginal infection \n\n \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n  Anaemia \nLeukocytosis \nLeukopenia \nLymphadenopathy \nThrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic \nshock \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Decreased appetite \nHyperglycaemia \nHyperlipidaemia \nHypoglycaemia\n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia \n \n\nAnxiety \nDepression \nLibido decreased \nNervousness \nThinking \nabnormal \n\nAbnormal dreams \nAgitation \nApathy \nDepersonalisation \nDrug dependence \nEuphoric mood \nHostility\n\nHallucination \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Migraine \nDizziness \nHypertonia \nParaesthesia \nSomnolence\n\nAmnesia \nHyperkinesia \nSezuire \nSpeech disorder \nTremor\n\nHepatic \nencepalopathy \nSyncope \n\nEye disorders  Amblyopia \nLacrimal disorder\n\nConjunctivitis \nMiosis\n\n \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n   Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders   Angina Pectoris \nBradycardia \nMyocardial \ninfarction \nPalpitations \nTachycardia\n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypertension \nVasodilatation\n\nHypotension Orthostatic \nhypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Cough Asthma \nDyspnoea \nYawning \n\nBronchospasm \nRespiratory \ndepression \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nConstipation \nNausea \n\nAbdominal Pain \nDiarrhoea \nDyspepsia \nFlatulence \nVomiting\n\nMouth ulceration \nTongue \ndiscolouration \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n   Hepatitis  \nHepatitis acute \nJaundice \n\n\n\n39 \n\nHepatic necrosis \nHepatorenal \nsyndrome \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nHyperhidrosis Pruritus \nRash \nUrticaria \n\nAcne \nAlopecia \nDermatitis \nexfoliative \nDry skin \nSkin mass\n\nAngioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Back Pain \nArthralgia \nMuscle spasms \nMyalgia\n\nArthritis  \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Urine \nAbnormality \n \n\nAlbuminuria \nDysuria \nHaematuria \nNephrolithiasis \nUrinary retention \n\n \n\nReproductive \nsystem and breast \ndisorders \n\n Erectile \ndysfunction \n\nAmenorrhoea \nEjaculation \ndisorder \nMenorrhagia \nMetrorrhagia\n\n \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nDrug withdrawal \nsyndrome \n\nAsthenia \nChest Pain \nChills \nPyrexia \nMalaise \nPain \nOedema \nperipheral \n\nHypothermia \n \n\nDrug withdrawal \nsyndrome \nneonatal (see \nsection 4.6) \n\nInvestigations  Liver function test \nabnormal \nWeight decreased\n\nBlood creatinine \nincreased \n\nTransaminases \nincreased \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Injury Heat stroke  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n \nIn cases of intravenous drug misuse, some adverse experiences are attributed to the act of misuse \nrather than the medicinal product and include local reactions, sometimes septic (abscess, cellulitis), \nand potentially serious acute hepatitis, and other acute infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis \nhave been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nIn patients presenting with marked drug dependence, initial administration of buprenorphine can \nproduce a drug withdrawal syndrome similar to that associated with naloxone (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nRespiratory depression as a result of central nervous system depression is the primary symptom \nrequiring intervention in the case of overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Signs \nof overdose may also include somnolence, amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and/or \nspeech disorders. \n \nManagement \nGeneral supportive measures should be instituted, including close monitoring of respiratory and \ncardiac status of the patient.  Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression, and standard intensive \ncare measures, should be implemented. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation must be \nassured. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation facilities \nare available. \n \nIf the patient vomits, care must be taken to prevent aspiration of the vomitus. \n \nUse of an opioid antagonist (i.e., naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in \nreversing the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioid \nagents. \n \nIf naloxone is used, the long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration \nwhen determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an \noverdose. Naloxone can be cleared more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of \npreviously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms, so a continuing infusion may be necessary. \nIf infusion is not possible, repeated dosing with naloxone may be required.  Initial naloxone doses may \nrange up to 2 mg and be repeated every 2-3 minutes until a satisfactory response is achieved, \nbut should not exceed a 10 mg starting dose. Ongoing intravenous infusion rates should be titrated to \npatient response. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in addictive disorders, ATC \ncode: N07BC51. \n \nMechanism of action \nBuprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which binds to the \uf06d and \uf06b (kappa) opioid \nreceptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible \nproperties with the \uf06d-opioid receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of \naddicted patients for drugs. \n \nOpioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-dependent \npersons. \n \nNaloxone is an antagonist at \uf06d-opioid receptors. When administered orally or sublingually in usual \ndoses to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal, naloxone exhibits little or no pharmacological effect \nbecause of its almost complete first pass metabolism. However, when administered intravenously to \nopioid-dependent persons, the presence of naloxone in Suboxone produces marked opioid antagonist \neffects and opioid withdrawal, thereby deterring intravenous abuse. \n \nClinical efficacy \nEfficacy and safety data for buprenorphine/naloxone are primarily derived from a one-year clinical \ntrial, comprising a 4-week randomised double blind comparison of buprenorphine/naloxone, \n\n\n\n41 \n\nbuprenorphine and placebo followed by a 48 week safety study of buprenorphine/naloxone. In this \ntrial, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine/naloxone 16 mg \nper day, 16 mg buprenorphine per day or placebo. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, \ndosing began with 8 mg of buprenorphine on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg) of buprenorphine \non Day 2. On Day 3, those randomized to receive buprenorphine/naloxone were switched to the \ncombination tablet. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing and \nefficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. The primary study comparison \nwas to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone individually against placebo. \nThe percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples that were negative for non-study opioids was \nstatistically higher for both buprenorphine/naloxone versus placebo (p < 0.0001) and buprenorphine \nversus placebo (p < 0.0001). \n \nIn a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution to \na full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual solution \nof buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low enough \nto serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3 to10 day induction phase, a 16-week maintenance \nphase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; \nactive control doses were titrated more gradually. Based on retention in treatment and the percentage \nof thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than \nthe low dose of the control, in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in reducing their use of opioids \nwhile in treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine, 8 mg per day was similar to that of the \nmoderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBuprenorphine \n \nAbsorption \nBuprenorphine, when taken orally, undergoes first-pass metabolism with N-dealkylation and \nglucuroconjugation in the small intestine and the liver. The use of this medicinal product by the oral \nroute is therefore inappropriate. \n \nPeak plasma concentrations are achieved 90 minutes after sublingual administration. Plasma levels of \nbuprenorphine increased with the sublingual dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. Both Cmax and AUC of \nbuprenorphine increased with the increase in dose (in the range of 4-16 mg), although the increase was \nless than dose-proportional.  \n \nPharmacokinetic Parameter \n \n\nSuboxone 4 mg Suboxone 8 mg Suboxone 16 mg \n\nCmax ng/ml \n \n\n1.84 (39) 3.0 (51) 5.95 (38) \n\nAUC0-48   \nhour ng/ml \n\n12.52 (35) 20.22 (43) 34.89 (33) \n\n \nDistribution \nThe absorption of buprenorphine is followed by a rapid distribution phase (distribution half-life of 2 to \n5 hours). \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nBuprenorphine is metabolised by 14-N-dealkylation and glucuroconjugation of the parent molecule \nand the dealkylated metabolite. Clinical data confirm that CYP3A4 is responsible for the N-\ndealkylation of buprenorphine. N-dealkylbuprenorphine is a \uf06d-opioid agonist with weak intrinsic \nactivity. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nElimination of buprenorphine is bi- or tri-exponential, and has a mean half-life from plasma of \n32 hours.  \nBuprenorphine is eliminated in the faeces by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated metabolites \n(70 %), the rest being eliminated in the urine. \n \nNaloxone \n \nAbsorption and distribution  \nFollowing intravenous administration, naloxone is rapidly distributed (distribution half-\nlife ~ 4 minutes). Following oral administration, naloxone is barely detectable in plasma; following \nsublingual administration of buprenorphine/naloxone, plasma naloxone concentrations are low and \ndecline rapidly.  \n \nBiotransformation  \nThe medicinal product is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, and excreted \nin the urine. Naloxone has a mean half-life from plasma of 1.2 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients are available. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination plays a relatively small role (~30 %) in the overall clearance of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone. No dose modification based on renal function is required but caution is \nrecommended when dosing subjects with severe renal impairment (see Section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were \nevaluated in a post-marketing study.   \n \nTable 3 summarizes the results from a clinical trial in which the exposure after single-dose \nadministration of Suboxone 2.0/0.5mg (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual tablet was determined in \nhealthy subjects, and in subjects with hepatic impairment. \n \n\nTable 3.

No synergistic enhancement of toxicity has been \nobserved. Undesirable effects were based on the known pharmacological activity of opioid agonistic \nand/or antagonistic substances.  \n \nThe combination (4:1) of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride was not \nmutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test), and was not clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic \nassay in human lymphocytes or in an intravenous micronucleus test in the rat. \n \nReproduction studies by oral administration of buprenorphine: naloxone (ratio 1:1) indicated that \nembryolethality occurred in rats in the presence of maternal toxicity at all doses. The lowest dose \nstudied represented exposure multiples of 1x for buprenorphine and 5x for naloxone at the maximum \nhuman therapeutic dose calculated on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. No developmental toxicity was observed in \nrabbits at maternally toxic doses. Further, no teratogenicity has been observed in either rats or rabbits. \nA peri-postnatal study has not been conducted with buprenorphine/naloxone; however, maternal oral \nadministration of buprenorphine at high doses during gestation and lactation resulted in difficult \nparturition (possible as a result of the sedative effect of buprenorphine), high neonatal mortality and a \nslight delay in the development of some neurological functions (surface righting reflex and startle \nresponse) in neonatal rats. \n \nDietary administration of buprenorphine in the rat at dose levels of 500 ppm or greater produced a \nreduction in fertility demonstrated by reduced female conception rates. A dietary dose of 100 ppm \n(estimated exposure approximately 2.4x for buprenorphine at a human dose of 24 mg \nbuprenorphine/naloxone based on AUC, plasma levels of naloxone were below the limit of detection \nin rats) had no adverse effect on fertility in females. \n \nA carcinogenicity study with buprenorphine/naloxone was conducted in rats at doses of 7, 30 and \n120 mg/kg/day, with estimated exposure multiples of 3 to 75 times, based on a human daily sublingual \ndose of 16 mg calculated on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. Statistically significant increases in the incidence of \nbenign testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell adenomas were observed in all dosage groups.  \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSubstitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and \npsychological treatment. The intention of the naloxone component is to deter intravenous misuse. \nSuboxone is indicated in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be treated for \naddiction. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opiate \ndependence/addiction. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before induction \nPrior to treatment initiation, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- \nor short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use and the degree of opioid dependence. To avoid \nprecipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine only should be \nundertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident (demonstrated by a score \nindicating mild to moderate withdrawal on the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, COWS). \n- For patients dependent upon heroin or short-acting opioids, the first dose of \n\nbuprenorphine/naloxone must be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than \n6 hours after the patient last used opioids. \n\n- For patients receiving methadone, the dose of methadone must be reduced to a maximum of \n30 mg/day before beginning buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. The long half-life of methadone \nshould be considered when starting buprenorphine/naloxone. The first dose of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be taken only when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less \nthan 24 hours after the patient last used methadone. Buprenorphine may precipitate symptoms \nof withdrawal in patients dependent upon methadone. \n\n \nPosology \n \nInitiation therapy (induction) \nThe recommended starting dose in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age is two Suboxone \n2 mg/0.5 mg sublingual films or one Suboxone 4 mg/1 mg sublingual film. This may be achieved using \ntwo Suboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg sublingual films as a single dose or one Suboxone 4 mg/1 mg sublingual film, \nwhich can be repeated up to twice on day 1, to minimise undue withdrawal symptoms and retain the \npatient in treatment. \n \nDue to naloxone exposure being somewhat higher following buccal administration than sublingual \nadministration, it is recommended that the sublingual site of administration be used during induction to \nminimise naloxone exposure and to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal. \n \nDuring the initiation of treatment, daily supervision of dosing is recommended to ensure proper sublingual \nplacement of the dose and to observe patient response to treatment as a guide to effective dose titration \naccording to clinical effect. \n \nDosage stabilisation and maintenance therapy \nFollowing treatment induction on day 1, the patient must be rapidly stabilised on an adequate \nmaintenance dose by titrating to achieve a dose that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses \nopioid withdrawal effects and is guided by reassessment of the clinical and psychological status of the \npatient. The maximum single daily dose should not exceed 24 mg buprenorphine. \n \nDuring maintenance therapy, it may be necessary to periodically restabilise the patient on a new \nmaintenance dose in response to changing patient needs. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nLess than daily dosing \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved the frequency of Suboxone dosing may be \ndecreased to dosing every other day at twice the individually titrated daily dose. For example, a patient \nstabilised to receive a daily dose of 8 mg/2 mg may be given 16 mg/4 mg on alternate days, with no \ndose on the intervening days. In some patients, after a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, the \nfrequency of Suboxone dosing may be decreased to 3 times a week (for example on Monday, \nWednesday and Friday). The dose on Monday and Wednesday should be twice the individually \ntitrated daily dose, and the dose on Friday should be three times the individually titrated daily dose, \nwith no dose on the intervening days. However, the dose given on any one day should not exceed \n24 mg. Patients requiring a titrated daily dose > 8 mg/day may not find this regimen adequate. \n \nMedical withdrawal \nAfter a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, if the patient agrees, the dose may be reduced \ngradually to a lower maintenance dose, in some favourable cases, treatment may be discontinued. The \navailability of the sublingual film in doses of 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg and 8 mg/2 mg allows for a \ndownward titration of dose. For patients who may require a lower buprenorphine dose, buprenorphine \n0.4 mg sublingual tablets may be used. Patients should be monitored following medical withdrawal \nbecause of the potential for relapse. \n \nSwitching between sublingual and buccal sites of administration \nThe systemic exposure of buprenorphine between buccal and sublingual administration of Suboxone \nfilm is approximately similar (see section 5.2). Therefore, once induction is complete, patients can \nswitch between buccal and sublingual administration without significant risk of under- or overdosing. \n \nSwitching between buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone \nWhen used sublingually, buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine have similar clinical effects and \nare interchangeable; however, before switching between buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine, \nthe prescriber and patient should agree to the change, and the patient should be monitored in case a \nneed to readjust the dose occurs. \n \nSwitching between sublingual tablet and film (where applicable) \nPatients being switched between Suboxone sublingual tablets and Suboxone film should be started on \nthe same dose as the previously administered medicinal product. However, dose adjustments may be \nnecessary when switching between medicinal products. Due to the potentially greater relative \nbioavailability of Suboxone film compared to Suboxone sublingual tablets, patients switching from \nsublingual tablets to film should be monitored for overdose. Those switching from film to sublingual \ntablets should be monitored for withdrawal or other indications of underdosing. In clinical studies, the \npharmacokinetics of Suboxone film were not consistently shown to be similar to the respective dosage \nstrengths of Suboxone sublingual tablets, as well as to the combinations (see section 5.2). If switching \nbetween Suboxone film and Suboxone sublingual tablets, the patient should be monitored in case a \nneed to readjust the dose occurs. Combining different formulations or alternating between film and \nsublingual tablet formulations is not advised. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in elderly patients over 65 years of age has not \nbeen established. No recommendation on posology can be made. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAs buprenorphine/naloxone pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment \nlower initial doses and careful dose titration in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment are \nrecommended. Buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n(see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n48 \n\nModification of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose is not required in patients with renal impairment. \nCaution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in children below the age of 15 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSublingual use and/or buccal use only.  \n \nFor induction buprenorphine/naloxone should be administered sublingually. For maintenance therapy, \nSuboxone film may be administered buccally and/or sublingually.\u2009 \n \nThe film is not to be swallowed. The film is to be placed under the tongue or inside either cheek until \ncompletely dissolved. It is advised that patients moisten their mouths prior to dosing. Patients should \nnot swallow or consume food or drink until the film is completely dissolved. The film should not be \nmoved after placement, and proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient.  \n \nFor buccal use one film should be placed on the inside of the right or left cheek. If an additional film is \nnecessary to achieve the prescribed dose, an additional film should be placed on the opposite side.\u2009 \nThe film must be kept on the inside of the cheek until completely dissolved. If a third film is necessary \nto achieve the prescribed dose, it should be placed on the inside of the right or left cheek after the first \ntwo films have dissolved.  \n \nFor sublingual use one film should be placed under the tongue. If an additional film is necessary to \nachieve the prescribed dose, an additional film should be placed under the tongue on the opposite side. \nThe film must be kept under the tongue until completely dissolved. If a third film is necessary to \nachieve the prescribed dose, it should be placed under the tongue after the first two films have \ndissolved.  \n \nA daily dose can be made up from multiple Suboxone films of different strengths.\u2009\u2009This may be taken \nall at the same time or in two divided portions.\u2009\u2009The second portion should be placed sublingually \nand/or buccally directly after the first portion has dissolved.  \n \nNo more than two films should be administered at the same time. It should be ensured that the films do \nnot overlap.  \n \nThe film is not designed to be split or subdivided into smaller doses.  \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\u2022 Severe respiratory insufficiency \n\u2022 Severe hepatic impairment \n\u2022 Acute alcoholism or delirium tremens \n\u2022 Concomitant administration of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) for the treatment of \n\nalcohol or opioid dependence \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMisuse, abuse and diversion \n \nBuprenorphine can be misused or abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Some \nrisks of misuse and abuse include overdose, spread of blood-borne viral or localised and systemic \ninfections, respiratory depression and hepatic injury. Buprenorphine misuse by someone other than the \n\n\n\n49 \n\nintended patient poses the additional risk of new drug-dependent individuals using buprenorphine as \nthe primary drug of abuse and may occur if the medicinal product is distributed for illicit use directly \nby the intended patient or if it is not safeguarded against theft. \n \nSuboptimal treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone may prompt misuse by the patient, leading to \noverdose or treatment dropout. A patient who is underdosed with buprenorphine/naloxone may \ncontinue responding to uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms by self-medicating with opioids, alcohol or \nother sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines. \n \nTo minimise the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, appropriate precautions should be taken when \nprescribing and dispensing buprenorphine, such as avoiding prescribing multiple refills early in \ntreatment, and conducting patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring that is appropriate for the \npatient\u2019s needs. \n \nCombining buprenorphine with naloxone in Suboxone is intended to deter misuse and abuse of the \nbuprenorphine. Intravenous or intranasal misuse of Suboxone is expected to be less likely than with \nbuprenorphine alone since the naloxone in this medicinal product can precipitate withdrawal in \nindividual\u2019s dependent on heroin, methadone, or other opioid agonists. \n \nRespiratory depression \n \nA number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported, particularly when \nbuprenorphine was used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5) or when \nbuprenorphine was not used according to the prescribing information. Deaths have also been reported \nin association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such as alcohol \nor other opioids. If buprenorphine is administered to some non-opioid dependent individuals, who are \nnot tolerant to the effects of opioids, potentially fatal respiratory depression may occur. \n \nThis medicinal product should be used with care in patients with asthma or respiratory insufficiency \n(e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, \nhypercapnia, pre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis (curvature of spine leading to \npotential shortness of breath)). \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and non-\ndependent persons in case of accidental or deliberate ingestion. Patients must be warned to store the \nsachet safely, to never open the sachet in advance, to keep them out of the reach of children and other \nhousehold members, and not to use this medicinal product in front of children. An emergency unit \nshould be contacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion of ingestion. \n \nCNS depression \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone may cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or \ncentral nervous system depressants (such as benzodiazepines, tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics; see \nsections 4.5 and 4.7). \n \nRisk from concomitant use of sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or related \nmedicinal products \n \nConcomitant use of buprenorphine/naloxone and sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines \nor related medicinal products may result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because \nof these risks, concomitant prescribing with these sedative medicinal products should be reserved for \npatients for whom alternative treatment options are not possible. If a decision is made to prescribe \nbuprenorphine/naloxone concomitantly with sedative  medicinal products, the lowest effective dose of \nthe sedative medicines should be used, and the duration of treatment should be as short as possible. \nThe patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and \nsedation. In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients and their caregivers to be aware \nof these symptoms (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \nDependence \n \nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist at the \u00b5 (mu)-opiate receptor and chronic administration produces \ndependence of the opioid type. Studies in animals, as well as clinical experience, have demonstrated \nthat buprenorphine may produce dependence, but at a lower level than a full agonist, e.g. morphine. \n \nAbrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in a withdrawal syndrome \nthat may be delayed in onset. \n \nHepatitis and hepatic events \nCases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent addicts both in clinical trials and \nin post-marketing adverse reaction reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient \nasymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, \nhepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and death. In many cases the presence of pre-existing \nmitochondrial impairment (genetic disease, liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or \nhepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal \nproducts) and ongoing injecting drug use may have a causative or contributory role. These underlying \nfactors must be taken into consideration before prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone and during \ntreatment. When a hepatic event is suspected, further biological and aetiological evaluation is required. \nDepending upon the findings, the medicinal product may be discontinued cautiously so as to prevent \nwithdrawal symptoms and to prevent a return to illicit drug use. If the treatment is continued, hepatic \nfunction should be monitored closely. \n \nPrecipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome \n \nWhen initiating treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone, the physician must be aware of the partial \nagonist profile of buprenorphine and that it can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, \nparticularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid, or \nif administered less than 24 hours after the last dose of methadone. Patients should be  monitored \nduring the switching period from buprenorphine or methadone to buprenorphine/naloxone since \nwithdrawal symptoms have been reported. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be undertaken when objective signs of withdrawal are evident (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nWithdrawal symptoms may also be associated with sub-optimal dosing. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were \nevaluated in a post-marketing study. Both buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively metabolised in \nthe liver, and plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in patients \nwith moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects. Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by \nincreased levels of naloxone and/or buprenorphine. \n \nBaseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status is recommended prior to \ncommencing therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal products \n(see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at greater risk of liver injury. Regular \nmonitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.3 and 5.2). In patients with severe hepatic insufficiency the use of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated. \n \nRenal impairment \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nRenal elimination may be prolonged since 30 % of the administered dose is eliminated by the renal \nroute. Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is \nrecommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nCYP3 A inhibitors \n \nMedicinal products that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 may give rise to increased concentrations of \nbuprenorphine. A reduction of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose may be needed. Patients already \ntreated with CYP3A4 inhibitors should have their dose of buprenorphine/naloxone titrated carefully \nsince a reduced dose may be sufficient in these patients (see section 4.5). \n \nClass effects \n \nOpioids may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. \n \nOpioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures, so opioids should be used \nwith caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, in other circumstances where \ncerebrospinal pressure may be increased, or in patients with a history of seizure. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral \nstenosis. \n \nOpioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, or changes in the perception of pain as a \nsymptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of \nconcomitant disease. \n \nOpioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal cortical \ninsufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). \n \nOpioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure and should be used with caution in \npatients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. \n \nOpioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated patients. \n \nThe concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce an exaggeration of the \neffects of opioids, based on experience with morphine (see section 4.5). \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains maltitol liquid. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take this medicinal product. \nThis medicinal product contains sunset yellow (E 110). Sunset yellow may cause allergic reactions. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film i.e. essentially \u201csodium \nfree\u201d. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nUse in adolescents (age 15 - <18) \nDue to the lack of data in adolescents (age 15 - <18), patients in this age group should be more closely \nmonitored during treatment. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone should not be taken together with: \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n\u2022 Alcoholic drinks or medicinal products containing alcohol, as alcohol increases the sedative \neffect of buprenorphine (see section 4.7). \n\n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone should be used cautiously when co-administered with: \n\u2022 Sedatives such as benzodiazepines or related medicinal products \n The concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or \n\nrelated medicinal products increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death \nbecause of additive CNS depressant effect. The dose and duration of concomitant use of \nsedative medicinal products should be limited (see section 4.4). Patients should be warned that \nit is extremely dangerous to self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking this \nmedicinal product and should also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this \nmedicinal product only as directed by their physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Other central nervous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics \n\nand antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, \nanxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related substances: these \ncombinations increase central nervous system depression. The reduced level of alertness can \nmake driving and using machines hazardous. \n\n \n\u2022 Furthermore, adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full opioid \n\nagonist in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone. Therefore, the potential to overdose with \na full agonist exists, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist \neffects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining. \n\n \n\u2022 Naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects of \n\nbuprenorphine. Co-administration during buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is contraindicated \ndue to the potentially dangerous interaction that may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged \nand intense opioid withdrawal symptoms (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\u2022 CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor \n\nof CYP3A4) resulted in increased Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) of buprenorphine \n(approximately 50 % and 70 % respectively) and, to a lesser extent, of norbuprenorphine. \nPatients receiving Suboxone should be closely monitored and may require dose reduction if \ncombined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, nelfinavir or \nindinavir or azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, macrolide antibiotics). \n\n \n\u2022 CYP3A4 inducers: Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with buprenorphine may decrease \n\nbuprenorphine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in sub-optimal treatment of opioid \ndependence with buprenorphine. It is recommended that patients receiving \nbuprenorphine/naloxone should be closely monitored if inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered. The dose of buprenorphine or the \nCYP3A4 inducer may need to be adjusted accordingly. \n\n \n\u2022 The concomitant use of MAOI might produce exaggeration of the effects of opioids, based on \n\nexperience with morphine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of buprenorphine/naloxone in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. \n \nTowards the end of pregnancy buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn infant \neven after a short period of administration. Long-term administration of buprenorphine during the last \nthree months of pregnancy may cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, neonatal \n\n\n\n53 \n\ntremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed from \nseveral hours to several days after birth. \n \nDue to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days should be considered \nat the end of pregnancy, to prevent the risk of respiratory depression or withdrawal syndrome in \nneonates. \n \nFurthermore, the use of buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy should be assessed by the \nphysician. Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit \noutweighs the potential risk to the fetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether naloxone is excreted in human milk. Buprenorphine and its metabolites are \nexcreted in human milk. In rat\u2019s buprenorphine has been found to inhibit lactation. Therefore, \nbreastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with Suboxone. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies have shown a reduction in female fertility at high doses (systemic exposure > 2.4 times \nthe human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 24 mg buprenorphine, based on AUC; see \nsection 5.3). \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBuprenorphine/naloxone has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines \nwhen administered to opioid-dependent patients. This medicinal product may cause drowsiness, \ndizziness, or impaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If taken \ntogether with alcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPatients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery in case \nbuprenorphine/naloxone may adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported treatment-related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical \nstudies were constipation and symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, \nheadache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain). Some reports of seizure, vomiting, diarrhoea, and elevated \nliver function tests were considered serious. \n \nThe most commonly reported treatment-related adverse reactions associated with the sublingual or \nbuccal administration of buprenorphine/naloxone were oral hypoesthesia and oral mucosal erythema, \nrespectively. Other treatment-related adverse reactions reported by more than one patient were \nconstipation, glossodynia and vomiting. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported during post-marketing surveillance are also included. \n \nThe frequency of possible undesirable effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \nVery common (\u2265 1/10), Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), Not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nTable 1: Treatment-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing \nsurveillance of buprenorphine/naloxone \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon Uncommon Not Known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Influenza, \nInfection, \nPharyngitis, \nRhinitis\n\nUrinary tract \ninfection, \nVaginal infection \n\n \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n  Anaemia, \nLeukocytosis, \nLeukopenia, \nLymphadenopathy, \nThrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic \nshock \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Decreased appetite, \nHyperglycaemia, \nHyperlipidaemia, \nHypoglycaemia\n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia Anxiety, \nDepression, \nLibido decreased, \nNervousness, \nThinking \nabnormal \n\nAbnormal dreams, \nAgitation, \nApathy, \nDepersonalisation, \nDrug dependence, \nEuphoric mood, \nHostility\n\nHallucination \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Migraine, \nDizziness, \nHypertonia, \nParaesthesia, \nSomnolence \n\nAmnesia, \nDisturbance in \nattention, \nHyperkinesia, \nSeizure, \nSpeech disorder, \nTremor\n\nHepatic \nencephalopathy, \nSyncope \n\nEye disorders  Amblyopia, \nLacrimal disorder \n\nConjunctivitis, \nMiosis, \nVision blurred\n\n \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n   Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders   Angina pectoris, \nBradycardia, \nMyocardial \ninfarction, \nPalpitations, \nTachycardia\n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypertension, \nVasodilatation\n\nHypotension Orthostatic \nhypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Cough Asthma, \nDyspnoea, \nYawning \n\nBronchospasm, \nRespiratory \ndepression \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nConstipation, \nNausea \n\nAbdominal pain, \nDiarrhoea, \nDyspepsia, \nFlatulence, \nOral mucosal \nerythema,\n\nHypoaesthesia oral, \nGlossodynia, \nMouth ulceration, \nOedema mouth, \nOral pain, \nParaesthesia oral, \n\nGlossitis, \nStomatitis \n\n\n\n55 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon Uncommon Not Known \n\nVomiting Tongue \ndiscolouration\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n Hepatic function \nabnormal \n\n Hepatitis, \nHepatitis acute, \nJaundice, \nHepatic necrosis, \nHepatorenal \nsyndrome \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nHyperhidrosis Pruritus, \nRash, \nUrticaria \n\nAcne, \nAlopecia, \nDermatitis \nexfoliative, \nDry skin, \nSkin mass\n\nAngioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Back pain, \nArthralgia, \nMuscle spasms, \nMyalgia\n\nArthritis  \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Urine abnormality Albuminuria, \nDysuria, \nHaematuria, \nNephrolithiasis, \nUrinary retention \n\n \n\nReproductive \nsystem and breast \ndisorders \n\n Erectile \ndysfunction \n\nAmenorrhoea, \nEjaculation \ndisorder, \nMenorrhagia, \nMetrorrhagia\n\n \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nDrug withdrawal \nsyndrome \n\nAsthenia, \nChest pain, \nChills, \nPyrexia, \nMalaise, \nPain, \nOedema \nperipheral \n\nHypothermia Drug withdrawal \nsyndrome \nneonatal \n\nInvestigations  Liver function test \nabnormal, \nWeight decreased\n\nBlood creatinine \nincreased \n\nTransaminases \nincreased \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Injury Heat stroke, \nPoisoning \n(Intoxication)\n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nIn cases of intravenous drug misuse, some adverse reactions are attributed to the act of misuse rather \nthan the medicinal product and include local reactions, sometimes septic (abscess, cellulitis), and \npotentially serious acute hepatitis, and other infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis have been \nreported (see section 4.4). \n \nIn patients presenting with marked drug dependence, initial administration of buprenorphine can \nproduce a drug withdrawal syndrome similar to that associated with naloxone (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nRespiratory depression as a result of central nervous system depression is the primary symptom \nrequiring intervention in the case of overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Signs \nof overdose may also include somnolence, amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and/or \nspeech disorders. \n \nManagement \n \nGeneral supportive measures should be instituted, including close monitoring of respiratory and \ncardiac status of the patient. Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression and standard intensive \ncare measures should be implemented. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation must be \nassured. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation facilities \nare available. \n \nIf the patient vomits, care must be taken to prevent aspiration of the vomitus. \n \nUse of an opioid antagonist (i.e., naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in \nreversing the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioid \nagents. \n \nIf naloxone is used, the long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration \nwhen determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an \noverdose. Naloxone can be cleared more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of \npreviously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms, so a continuing infusion may be necessary. \nIf infusion is not possible, repeated dosing with naloxone may be required. Ongoing intravenous \ninfusion rates should be titrated to patient response. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in addictive disorders, ATC \ncode: N07BC51. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBuprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which binds to the \u03bc and \u03ba (kappa) opioid \nreceptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible \nproperties with the \u03bc-opioid receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of \naddicted patients for drugs. \n \nOpioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-dependent \npersons. \n \nNaloxone is an antagonist at \u03bc-opioid receptors. When administered orally or sublingually in usual \ndoses to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal, naloxone exhibits little or no pharmacological effect \n\n\n\n57 \n\nbecause of its almost complete first pass metabolism. However, when administered intravenously to \nopioid-dependent persons, the presence of naloxone in Suboxone produces marked opioid antagonist \neffects and opioid withdrawal, thereby deterring intravenous abuse. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety data for buprenorphine/naloxone are primarily derived from a one-year clinical \ntrial, comprising a 4-week randomised double blind comparison of buprenorphine/naloxone, \nbuprenorphine and placebo followed by a 48-week safety study of buprenorphine/naloxone. In this \ntrial, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine/naloxone 16 mg \nper day, 16 mg buprenorphine per day or placebo. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, \ndosing began with 8 mg of buprenorphine on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg) of buprenorphine \non Day 2. On Day 3, those randomized to receive buprenorphine/naloxone were switched to the \ncombination tablet. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing and \nefficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. The primary study comparison \nwas to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone individually against placebo. \nThe percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples that were negative for non-study opioids was \nstatistically higher for both buprenorphine/naloxone versus placebo (p < 0.0001) and buprenorphine \nversus placebo (p < 0.0001). \n \nIn a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution \nversus a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual \nsolution of buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low enough \nto serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3 to10 day induction phase, a 16-week maintenance \nphase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; \nactive control doses were titrated more gradually. Based on retention in treatment and the percentage \nof thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than \nthe low dose of the control in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in reducing their use of opioids \nwhile in treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine, 8 mg per day was similar to that of the \nmoderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated. \n \nIn a multicentre RCT study, 92 patients received either Suboxone film or Suboxone sublingual tablets \nfollowing a 7-day run-in period with Suboxone sublingual tablets. It took 4 minutes on average for the \nsublingual tablets to visibly dissolve and 3 minutes on average for the sublingual film to dissolve. As \nconcerns removability of sublingually applied films it was demonstrated that after 30 seconds of the \napplication of a single film, none of the study participants could remove some or all the film. \nHowever, when 2 or more films were administered the participants were more likely to be able to \nremove some or all the film after 30 seconds. No more than 2 films should be administered at the same \ntime (see section 4.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBuprenorphine \n \nAbsorption \nBuprenorphine, when taken orally, undergoes first-pass metabolism with N-dealkylation and \nglucuroconjugation in the small intestine and the liver. The use of this medicinal product by the oral \nroute is therefore inappropriate. \n \nPlasma levels of buprenorphine increased with increasing sublingual dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. \nThere was wide inter-patient variability in buprenorphine plasma levels, but within subjects the \nvariability was low. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nTable 2.

The \nparent molecule and the primary dealkylated metabolite, norbuprenorphine, undergo subsequent \nglucuronidation. Norbuprenorphine binds to opioid receptors in vitro; however, it is not known \nwhether norbuprenorphine contributes to the overall effect of buprenorphine/naloxone. \n \nElimination \nElimination of buprenorphine is bi- or tri-exponential, and the mean terminal elimination half-life \nfrom plasma is reported in Table 2. \nBuprenorphine is excreted in the faeces (~70 %) by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated \nmetabolites, the rest (~30 %) being excreted in the urine. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nBuprenorphine Cmax and AUC increased in a linear fashion with the increasing dose (in the range of 4 \nto 16 mg), although the increase was not directly dose-proportional. \n \nNaloxone \n \nAbsorption \nNaloxone mean peak plasma concentrations were too low to assess dose-proportionality, and in seven \nof eight subjects tested who had naloxone plasma levels above the limit of quantification \n(0.05 ng/mL), naloxone was not detected beyond 2 hours post-dose. \nNaloxone has not been found to affect the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine, and both \nbuprenorphine sublingual tablets and buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film deliver similar plasma \nconcentrations of buprenorphine. \n \nDistribution \nNaloxone is approximately 45 % protein bound, primarily to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \nNaloxone is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, and excreted in the urine. \nNaloxone undergoes direct glucuronidation to naloxone 3-glucuronide, as well as N-dealkylation and \nreduction of the 6-oxo group. \n \nElimination \nNaloxone is excreted in the urine, with a mean half-life of elimination from plasma ranging from 2 to \n12 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients are available. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination plays a relatively small role (~30 %) in the overall clearance of \nbuprenorphine/naloxone. No dose modification based on renal function is required but caution is \nrecommended when dosing subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine were evaluated in a post-\nmarketing study. Table 4 summarises the results from a clinical trial in which the exposure of \n\n\n\n60 \n\nbuprenorphine and naloxone was determined after administering a buprenorphine/naloxone 2.0/0.5 mg \nsublingual tablet in healthy subjects, and in subjects with varied degrees of hepatic impairment. \n \nTable 4.

No synergistic enhancement of toxicity has been \nobserved. Undesirable effects were based on the known pharmacological activity of opioid agonist \nand/or antagonistic substances. \n \nThe combination (4:1) of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride was not \nmutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test) and was not clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic \nassay in human lymphocytes or in an intravenous micronucleus test in the rat. \n \nReproduction studies by oral administration of buprenorphine: naloxone (ratio 1:1) indicated that \nembryolethality occurred in rats in the presence of maternal toxicity at all doses. The lowest dose \nstudied represented exposure multiples of 1 \u00d7 for buprenorphine and 5 \u00d7 for naloxone at the maximum \nhuman therapeutic dose calculated on a mg/m2 basis. No developmental toxicity was observed in \nrabbits at maternally toxic doses. Further, no teratogenicity has been observed in either rats or rabbits. \nA peri-postnatal study has not been conducted with buprenorphine/naloxone; however, maternal oral \nadministration of buprenorphine at high doses during gestation and lactation resulted in difficult \nparturition (possible as a result of the sedative effect of buprenorphine), high neonatal mortality and a \nslight delay in the development of some neurological functions (surface righting reflex and startle \nresponse) in neonatal rats. \n \nDietary administration of buprenorphine/naloxone in the rat at dose levels of 500 ppm or greater \nproduced a reduction in fertility demonstrated by reduced female conception rates. A dietary dose of \n100 ppm (estimated exposure approximately 2.4 \u00d7 for buprenorphine at a human dose of 24 mg \nbuprenorphine/naloxone based on AUC, plasma levels of naloxone were below the limit of detection \nin rats) had no adverse effect on fertility in females. \n \nA carcinogenicity study with buprenorphine/naloxone was conducted in rats at doses of 7 mg/kg/day, \n30 mg/kg/day and 120 mg/kg/day, with estimated exposure multiples of 3 times to 75 times, based on \na human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg calculated on a mg/m2 basis. Statistically significant increases \nin the incidence of benign testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell adenomas were observed in all dosage \ngroups. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n6.

These include medicines used to treat \n\nepilepsy (such as carbamazepine and phenytoin), and medicines used to treat tuberculosis \n(rifampicin). \n\n\uf0b7 naltrexone and nalmefene (drugs used to treat addiction disorders) may prevent the therapeutic \neffects of Suboxone. They should not be taken at the same time as Suboxone treatment because \nyou may experience a sudden onset of prolonged and intense withdrawal. \n\n \n \nSuboxone with food, drink and alcohol \nAlcohol may increase drowsiness and may increase the risk of respiratory failure if taken with \nSuboxone.

You should leave at least 6 hours after you use a short-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, \nheroin) or at least 24 hours after you use a long-acting opioid such as methadone. \n\n \nThis medicine can also cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it abruptly. See section 3 \n\u2018stopping treatment\u2019. \n\n \n\u2022 Liver damage \n\nLiver damage has been reported after taking Suboxone, especially when the medicine is \nmisused. This could also be due to viral infections (e.g. chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, \nanorexia or use of other medicines with the ability to harm your liver (see section 4). Regular \nblood tests may be conducted by your doctor to monitor the condition of your liver. Tell \nyour doctor if you have any liver problems before you start treatment with Suboxone. \n\n \n\u2022 Blood pressure \n\nThis medicine may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to feel dizzy if you \nget up too quickly from sitting or lying down. \n\n \n\u2022 Diagnosis of unrelated medical conditions \n \n\nThis medicine may mask pain symptoms that could assist in the diagnosis of some diseases. \nYou must tell your doctor that you take this medicine. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 15. If you are between 15 and 18 years old \nyour doctor may monitor you more closely during treatment, because of the lack of data in this age \ngroup. \n \nOther medicines and Suboxone \n\n\n\n116 \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nSome medicines may increase the side effects of Suboxone, and these can be serious. Do not take any \nother medicines whilst taking Suboxone without first talking to your doctor, especially: \n \n\u2022 Benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders) such as diazepam, temazepam, or \n\nalprazolam. Concomitant use of Suboxone and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or \nrelated medicines increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory \ndepression), coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should only be \nconsidered when other treatment options are not possible. \nHowever if your doctor does prescribe Suboxone together with sedative medicines the dose and \nduration of concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor. \nPlease tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor\u2019s \ndose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of \nthe signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms.  \n\n \n\u2022 Other medicines that may make you feel sleepy which are used to treat illnesses such as \n\nanxiety, sleeplessness, convulsions/seizures, pain. These types of medicines may reduce your \nalertness levels making it difficult for you to drive and use machines. They may also cause \ncentral nervous system depression, which is very serious. Below is a list of examples of these \ntypes of medicines: \n\n \n- Other opioid containing medicines such as methadone, certain painkillers and cough \n\nsuppressants. \n- Antidepressants (used to treat depression) such as isocarboxazid, phenelzine, selegiline, \n\ntranylcypromine and valproate may increase the effects of this medicine. \n- Sedative H1 receptor antagonists (used to treat allergic reactions) such as \n\ndiphenhydramine and chlorphenamine. \n- Barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as phenobarbital, secobarbital. \n- Tranquilisers (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as chloral hydrate. \n\n \n\u2022 Clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure) may extend the effects of this medicine. \n\u2022 Antiretrovirals (used to treat HIV) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir may increase the \n\neffects of this medicine. \n\u2022 Some antifungal agents (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, \n\ncertain antibiotics, may extend the effects of this medicine. Some medicines may decrease the \neffect of Suboxone. These include medicines used to treat epilepsy (such as carbamazepine and \nphenytoin), and medicines used to treat tuberculosis (rifampicin). \n\n\u2022 Naltrexone and nalmefene (medicines used to treat addictive disorders) may prevent the \ntherapeutic effects of Suboxone. They should not be taken at the same time as Suboxone \ntreatment because you may experience a sudden onset of prolonged and intense withdrawal. \n\n \nSuboxone with food, drink and alcohol \nDo not have alcohol whilst being treated with this medicine. Alcohol may increase drowsiness and \nmay increase the risk of respiratory failure if taken with Suboxone. Do not swallow or consume food \nor any drink until the film is completely dissolved. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. The \nrisks of using Suboxone in pregnant women are not known. Your doctor will decide if your treatment \nshould be continued with an alternative medicine. \n \nWhen taken during pregnancy, particularly late pregnancy, medicines like Suboxone may cause drug \nwithdrawal symptoms including problems with breathing in your newborn baby. This may appear \nseveral days after birth. \n \nDo not breast-feed whilst taking this medicine, as buprenorphine passes into breast milk. \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive, cycle, use any tools or machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know how \nthis medicine affects you. Suboxone may cause drowsiness, dizziness or impair your thinking. This \nmay happen more often in the first few weeks of treatment when your dose is being changed, but it can \nalso happen if you drink alcohol or take other sedative medicines at the same time as when you take \nSuboxone. \n \nSuboxone contains maltitol, sunset yellow (E110) and sodium. \nSuboxone contains maltitol liquid. If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to \nsome sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nSuboxone contains sunset yellow (E110), which may cause allergic reactions. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium \nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Suboxone \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nYour treatment is prescribed and monitored by doctors who are experienced in the treatment of drug \ndependence. \n \nYour doctor will determine the best dose for you. During your treatment, the doctor may adjust the \ndose, depending upon your response to treatment. \n \n \nStarting treatment \nThe recommended starting dose for adults and adolescents over the age of 15 years is usually two \nSuboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg sublingual films, or one Suboxone 4 mg/1 mg sublingual film. \n \nThis dose may be repeated up to twice on day 1 depending on your needs. \n \nYou should be aware of the clear signs of withdrawal before taking your first dose of Suboxone. Your \ndoctor will tell you when to take your first dose. \n \n\u2022 Starting treatment of Suboxone whilst dependent on heroin \n \n\nIf you are dependent upon heroin or a short-acting opioid, your first dose should be taken when \nsigns of withdrawal appear, at least 6 hours after you last used opioids. \n\n \n\u2022 Starting treatment of Suboxone whilst dependent on methadone \n \n\nIf you have been taking methadone or a long acting opioid, the dose of methadone should \nideally be reduced to below 30 mg/day before beginning Suboxone therapy. The first dose of \nSuboxone should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, and at least 24 hours after you \nlast used methadone. \n\n \nDose adjustment and maintenance therapy: During the days after you start treatment, your doctor \nmay increase the dose of Suboxone you take according to your needs. If you think that the effect of \nSuboxone is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. The maximum daily dose is \n24 mg buprenorphine. \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \nAfter a time of successful treatment, you may agree with your doctor to reduce the dose gradually to a \nlower maintenance dose. \n \nTaking Suboxone \n\u2022 Take the dose once a day, at approximately the same time. \n\u2022 It is advisable to moisten your mouth before taking the film. \n\u2022 Place the sublingual film under the tongue (sublingual use) or on the inside of the cheek (buccal \n\nuse) as advised by your doctor. Ensure the films do not overlap. \n\u2022 Keep the films in place under the tongue, or inside of the cheek, until they have completely \n\ndissolved. \n\u2022 Do not chew or swallow the film, as the medicine will not work, and you may get withdrawal \n\nsymptoms. \n\u2022 Do not consume any food or drink until the film has completely dissolved. \n\u2022 Do not split the film or subdivide into smaller doses. \n \nHow to remove the film from the sachet \n \nEach Suboxone film comes in a sealed child\u2010resistant sachet. Do not open the sachet until you are \nready to use it. \n \nTo open the sachet, find the dotted line that runs along the top edge of the sachet and fold the edge of \nthe sachet along the dotted line (see Figure 1). \n \n\n \nFigure 1 \n \n\u2022 Folding the sachet along the dotted line exposes a slit through the folded edge of the sachet that \n\ncan then be torn in the direction of the arrow. \n \n\u2022 Alternatively, the sachet may be cut with scissors along the arrow (see Figure 2). \n \n\n \nFigure 2 \n \nIf the sachet is damaged, discard the film. \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \nHow to place a film under your tongue (sublingual use): \nDrink water to moisten your mouth first. This helps the film dissolve more easily. Then, hold a film \nbetween two fingers by the outside edges, and place the film under your tongue, close to the base \neither to the left or right (see Figure 3). \n \n\n \nFigure 3 \n \nIf your doctor tells you to take two films at a time, place the second film under your tongue on the \nopposite side. Ensure the films do not overlap \nIf your doctor tells you to take a third film, place it under your tongue on either side after the first two \nfilms have dissolved. \n \nHow to place a film on the inside of your cheek (buccal use): \nDrink water to moisten your mouth. Hold the film between two fingers by the outside edges and place \none film on the inside of your right or left cheek (see Figure 4). \n \n \n\n \n \nFigure 4 \n \nIf your doctor tells you to take two films at a time, place the other film on the inside of the opposite \ncheek: and this will ensure that the films do not overlap. If your doctor tells you to take a third film, \nplace it on the inside of your right or left cheek after the first two films have dissolved. \n \n\n\n\n120 \n\nIf you take more Suboxone than you should \nSeek urgent medical attention if you or someone else takes too much of this medicine. \nOverdose with Suboxone may cause serious and life-threatening breathing problems. \n \nSymptoms of overdose may include feeling sleepy and uncoordinated with slowed reflexes, blurred \nvision, and/or slurred speech. You may be unable to think clearly and may breathe much slower than \nis normal for you. \n \nIf you forget to take Suboxone \nTell your doctor as soon as possible if you miss a dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Suboxone \nStopping treatment suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms. Depending on your condition, the \ndose of Suboxone may continue to be reduced under careful medical supervision, until eventually it \nmay be stopped. Do not change the treatment in any way or stop treatment without the agreement of \nthe doctor who is treating you. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

and valproate may increase the effects of this medicine. \u2010 sedative h\u0131 receptor antagonists (used to treat allergic reactions) such as diphenhydramine and chlorphenamine. \u2010 barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as phenobarbital, secobarbital \u2010 tranquilisers (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as chloral hydrate. clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure) may extend the effects of this medicine. anti-retrovirals (used to treat hiv) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir may increase the effects of this medicine. some antifungal agents (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, certain antibiotics, may extend the effects of this medicine. some medicines may decrease the effect of suboxone. these include medicines used to

withdrawal symptoms including problems with breathing in your newborn baby. this may appear several days after birth. do not breast-feed whilst taking this medicine, since suboxone passes into breast milk. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. driving and using machines suboxone may cause drowsiness. this may happen more often in the first few weeks of treatment when your dose is being changed, but can also happen if you drink alcohol or take other sedative medicines when you take suboxone. do not drive, use any tools or machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know how this medicine affects you. suboxone contains lactose if you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this

for adults and adolescents over the age of 15 years is one to two tablets of suboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg. an additional one to two tablets of the suboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg may be administered on day 1 depending on your needs. clear signs of withdrawal should be evident before taking your first dose of suboxone. a doctor's assessment of your readiness for treatment will guide the timing of your first suboxone dose. starting treatment of suboxone whilst dependent on heroin if you are dependent upon heroin or a short acting opioid, your first dose of suboxone should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than 6 hours after you last used opioids. starting treatment of suboxone whilst dependent on methadone if you have been taking methadone or a long acting opioid, the dose of methadone should ideally be reduced to below 30 mg/day before beginning suboxone therapy. the first dose of suboxone should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than 24 hours after you last used methadone. taking suboxone take the dose once a day by placing the tablets under the tongue. keep the tablets in place under the tongue until they have completely dissolved. this may take 5-10 minutes. do not chew or swallow the tablets, as the medicine will not work and you may get withdrawal symptoms. do not consume any food or drink until the tablets have completely dissolved. how to remove the tablet from the blister 1 - do not push the tablet through the foil. 2 - remove just one section from the blister pack, tearing it along the perforated line. 3 starting from the edge where

pharmacist. the maximum daily dose is 24 mg. after a time of successful treatment, you may agree with your doctor to reduce the dose gradually to a lower maintenance dose. stopping treatment depending on your condition, the dose of suboxone may continue to be reduced under careful medical supervision, until eventually it may be stopped. do not change the treatment in any way or stop treatment without the agreement of the doctor who is treating you. if you take more suboxone than you should if you or someone else takes too much of this medicine, you must go or be taken immediately to an emergency centre or hospital for treatment as overdose with suboxone may cause serious and life- threatening breathing problems. symptoms of overdose may include feeling sleepy and uncoordinated with slowed reflexes, blurred vision, and/or slurred speech. you may be unable to think clearly, and may breathe much slower than is normal for you. 1 2 3 95 if you forget to take suboxone tell your doctor
