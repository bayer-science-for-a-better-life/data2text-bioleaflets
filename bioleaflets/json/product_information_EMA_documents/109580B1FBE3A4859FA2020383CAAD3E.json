NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRasitrio 150 mg/5 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate), 5 mg amlodipine (as besylate) \n\nand 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nViolet white, ovaloid convex film-coated tablet with bevelled edges, with “YIY” debossed on one side \n\nand “NVR” on the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasitrio is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult \n\npatients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasitrio is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets given \n\nconcurrently at the same time of the day may be switched to a fixed combination tablet of Rasitrio \n\ncontaining the same component doses. \n\n \n\nThe fixed dose combination should only be used after a stable effect on the monocomponents, given \n\nconcurrently, has been established after dose titration. Dose should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly patients aged 65 years and over \n\nThere is evidence of an increased risk of adverse events related to hypotension in patients aged \n\n65 years or older treated with Rasitrio. Therefore, particular caution should be exercised when \n\nadministering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or over. \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in this group of patients is 150 mg. No clinically \n\nmeaningful additional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the \n\nmajority of elderly patients. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n3 \n\nElderly patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older (see \n\nsection 5.2). The use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older should be restricted to patients for \n\nwhom blood pressure control has been established for the free combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently without accompanying safety concerns, in particular \n\nhypotension. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is \n\nrecommended (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 89-60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n and 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n, \n\nrespectively) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated for use in patients with anuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). The concomitant use of Rasitrio with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) or \n\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment \n\n(GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen administering Rasitrio in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or patients with \n\nprogressive liver disease. No dosage recommendations have been established for amlodipine in \n\npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasitrio in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasitrio should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Rasitrio (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to \n\nother dihydropyridine derivatives, or to other sulphonamide-derived substances. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n Anuria. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n Hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, symptomatic hyperuricaemia and refractory hypokalaemia. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\n\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasitrio therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients \n\nwith ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial \n\ninfarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in \n\npatients with allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. Close monitoring of blood pressure, renal \n\nfunction and electrolytes should be exercised if co-administration is considered absolutely necessary. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 65 years and over \n\nParticular caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or older. \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. Patients aged \n\n65 years old or over, are more susceptible to hypotension-related adverse reactions following \n\ntreatment with Rasitrio (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited efficacy and safety data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or \n\nolder. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended (see \n\nsections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nNo data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are available for Rasitrio in patients with heart \n\nfailure (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n5 \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasitrio in the following \n\ncases: \n\n Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \n\ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \n\nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasitrio, or the treatment \n\nshould start under close medical supervision. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Rasitrio should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Rasitrio should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nHypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in \n\npatients with cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3, 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Rasitrio therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that Rasitrio would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \n\ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n6 \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Rasitrio is \n\nused in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. No data is available in hypertensive \n\npatients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \n\n≥177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in men and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension. Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) or \n\nanuria (see sections 4.2. and 4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \n\nrenal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the RAAS, caution should be exercised when Rasitrio is \n\ngiven in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver \n\ndisease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren \n\nin post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Rasitrio in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation, therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 \n\nand 5.2). Caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio to patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment or progressive liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe half life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \n\nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated when using amlodipine in patients suffering \n\nfrom aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dose adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic medicinal products may be required during Rasitrio therapy. Concomitant use of \n\nRasitrio with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n7 \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal products \n\nacting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, \n\nincluding acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. \n\nTherefore caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system (RAAS), angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the \n\nface, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal products that can cause angioedema, including \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasitrio should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Rasitrio, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is \n\nto discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may \n\nneed to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing \n\nacute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio interactions \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with hypertension did not indicate any clinically \n\nrelevant changes in the steady-state exposure (AUC) and Cmax of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide compared to the corresponding dual therapies. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels: The potassium-depleting effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal \n\nproducts associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \n\ncorticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocoricotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents affecting the \n\nRAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, \n\npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum \n\npotassium. If co-medication with an agent affecting the level of serum potassium is considered \n\nnecessary, caution is advisable. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not \n\nrecommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: Periodic monitoring of serum \n\npotassium is recommended when Rasitrio is administered with medicinal products affected by serum \n\npotassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs: As with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may \n\nalso weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the use of \n\nRasitrio with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nInformation on aliskiren interactions \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n- Dual RAAS blockade \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- P-glycoprotein (P-gp) potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \n\nCo-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is \n\nlikely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by \n\ngrapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, \n\ngrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasitrio. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- P-gp interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced \n\naliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s \n\nwort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has not been investigated for \n\naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp \n\ninhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may \n\nincrease tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will \n\nlikely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\n- Moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \n\nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-administration with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination \n\nof aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal \n\nimpairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- Furosemide and torasemide \n\nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see interaction with organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n- Warfarin \n\nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\n- Food interactions \n\nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n\n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of aliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nInformation on amlodipine interactions \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on amlodipine \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \n\nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \n\nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n11 \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\n- Dantrolene (infusion) \n\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nEffects of amlodipine on other medicinal products \n\n- The blood pressure lowering effects of amlodipine add to the blood pressure lowering effects of \n\nother antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in \n\na 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to \n\nlimit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, \n\ndigoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nInformation on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nNot recommended \n\n- Lithium \n\nRenal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may be \n\nincreased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- Alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics \nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances that also have a blood pressure \n\nlowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system activity or direct vasodilatation) \n\nmay potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\n- Amantadine \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions caused by \n\namantadine. \n\n \n\n- Antidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be \n\nnecessary (see section 4.4). Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk of lactic \n\nacidosis induced by possible functional renal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n12 \n\n- Anticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. \n\natropine, biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach \n\nemptying rate. Conversely, it is anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease \n\nthe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products used in the treatment of gout \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise \n\nthe level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-\n\nadministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when \n\nassociated with medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and \n\nClass III antiarrhythmics and some antipsychotics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum sodium level \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified by concomitant administration of medicinal \n\nproducts such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term \n\nadministration of these medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Beta blockers and diazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase \n\nthe risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the \n\nhyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\n- Ion exchange resins \n\nAbsorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. However, staggering the \n\ndosage of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n \n\n- Vitamin D and calcium salts \n\nAdministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with vitamin D or with calcium \n\nsalts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide type diuretics may lead to \n\nhypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or \n\nvitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. \n\n \n\n- Non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the action of skeletal muscle relaxants such as \n\ncurare derivatives. \n\n \n\n- Cytotoxic agents \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\n- Digoxine or digitalis glycosides \n\nThiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of digitalis-induced cardiac \n\narrhythmias (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n- Methyldopa \n\nThere have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n13 \n\n- Iodine contrasting agents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute renal failure, especially \n\nwith high doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before administration. \n\n \n\n- Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical \n\nsignificance of this effect is uncertain and not sufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\nHealthcare professionals prescribing Rasitrio should counsel women of childbearing potential about \n\nthe potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment \n\nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasitrio should not be used in women \n\nplanning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \n\nsystem have been associated with serious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any \n\nmedicinal product that acts directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, aliskiren should not \n\nbe used during the first trimester of pregnancy and is contraindicated during the second and third \n\ntrimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. Reproductive studies in rats \n\nhave shown no toxicity except for delayed date of delivery and prolonged duration of labour at \n\ndosages 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans (see section 5.3). Use \n\nin pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself \n\ncarries greater risk for the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nRasitrio should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasitrio is contraindicated during \n\nthe second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasitrio should be discontinued accordingly as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was \n\nsecreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n14 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Rasitrio during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Rasitrio is used during breast-\n\nfeeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility with the use of Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\nThe fertility of rats was unaffected at doses of up to aliskiren 250 mg/kg/day and hydrochlorothiazide \n\n4 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \n\nwhen driving vehicles or using machines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may \n\noccasionally occur when taking Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \n\ntaking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, drowsiness, headache, fatigue or nausea, the ability to react \n\nmay be impaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nThe safety profile of Rasitrio presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Rasitrio and \n\nthe known safety profile of the individual components aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nSafety information for Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions observed with Rasitrio are hypotension and dizziness. The \n\nadverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components of Rasitrio (aliskiren, \n\namlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide) and listed in the respective paragraphs on the individual \n\ncomponents may occur with Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse reactions for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide are ranked under heading of \n\nfrequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Common Hypotension \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common Peripheral oedema \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n15 \n\nPeripheral oedema is a known, dose-dependent adverse reaction of amlodipine and has also been \n\nreported with aliskiren therapy in post-marketing experience. The incidence of peripheral oedema for \n\nRasitrio in a short-term double active-controlled study was 7.1% compared to 8.0% for \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, 4.1% for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.0% for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of any adverse reactions potentially related to hypotension in a short-term active \n\ncontrolled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to 3.7% with dual combinations. In patients \n\n≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up to 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\nOther adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with \n\nRasitrio even if not observed in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nSerious adverse reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which have been reported in \n\npost-marketing experience and may occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). The most \n\ncommon adverse reaction is diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe known aliskiren adverse reactions are presented in the table below using the same convention as \n\ndescribed previously for the fixed combination. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare Anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\n Uncommon Palpitations, oedema peripheral \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon Hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Uncommon Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common Diarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Not known Liver disorder*, jaundice, hepatitis, liver failure** \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens \n\nJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), oral mucosal \n\nreactions, rash, pruritus, urticaria \n\n Rare Angioedema, erythema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Uncommon Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nInvestigations \n\n Common Hyperkalaemia \n\n Uncommon Liver enzyme increased \n\n Rare Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased, blood creatinine \n\nincreased \n\n*Isolated cases of liver disorder with clinical symptoms and laboratory evidence of more marked \n\nhepatic dysfunction. \n\n**Including one case of ‘liver failure fulminant’ reported in the post-marketing experience, for which \n\na causal relationship with aliskiren cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n16 \n\nDescription of selected adverse events: \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have occurred during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing, or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations: In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory \n\nparameters were uncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in \n\nhypertensive patients, aliskiren had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density \n\nlipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other medicinal products acting on \n\nthe RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n<60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: Based on the limited amount of safety data available from a pharmacokinetic \n\nstudy of aliskiren treatment in 39 hypertensive children 6-17 years of age, the frequency, type and \n\nseverity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar to that seen in hypertensive adults. \n\nAs for other RAAS blockers, headache is a common adverse event in children treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n17 \n\nAmlodipine \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nVery rare Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nVery rare Allergic reactions \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery rare Hyperglycaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nUncommon Insomnia, mood changes (including anxiety), depression \n\nRare Confusion \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Somnolence, headache (especially at the beginning of treatment) \n\nUncommon Tremor, dysgeusia, syncope, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia \n\nVery rare Hypertonia, peripheral neuropathy \n\nEye disorders \n\nUncommon Visual disturbance (including diplopia) \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nUncommon Tinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon Palpitations \n\nVery rare Myocardial infarction, arrhythmia (including bradycardia, \n\nventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon Flushing \n\nVery rare Vasculitis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Dyspnoea, rhinitis \n\nVery rare Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Abdominal pain, nausea \n\nUncommon Vomiting, dyspepsia, altered bowel habits (including diarrhoea and \n\nconstipation), dry mouth \n\nVery rare Pancreatitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nVery rare Hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic enzymes increased (mostly consistent \n\nwith cholestasis) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Alopecia, purpura, skin decolouration, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, rash, \n\nexanthema \n\nVery rare Angioedema, erythema multiforme, urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome, Quincke oedema, photosensitivity \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Ankle swelling \n\nUncommon Arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, back pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nUncommon Micturition disorder, nocturia, increased urinary frequency \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nUncommon Impotence, gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Oedema, fatigue \n\nUncommon Chest pain, asthenia, pain, malaise \n\nInvestigations \n\nUncommon Weight increase, weight decrease \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nExceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Rasitrio.

Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension \n\nup to and including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur with Rasitrio, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdose calls for active cardiovascular support \n\nincluding frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities and \n\nattention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \n\n \n\nA vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is \n\nno contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the \n\neffects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to \n\n2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of \n\namlodipine. \n\n \n\nSince amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (<2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n20 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, renin-inhibitors; ATC \n\ncode C09XA54 \n\n \n\nRasitrio combines three antihypertensive active substances with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: aliskiren belongs to the direct renin \n\ninhibitor class, amlodipine to the calcium channel blocker class and hydrochlorothiazide to the \n\nthiazide diuretics class. When combined, the consolidated effects of inhibition of the renin-\n\nangiotensin-aldosterone system, calcium channel-mediated vasodilatation and sodium chloride \n\nexcretion result in a reduction of blood pressure to a greater degree than the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Rasitrio provided clinically meaningful \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The greater blood pressure reduction for Rasitrio over each dual combination was seen \n\nat every hour including the early morning hours with the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure \n\nmonitoring. \n\n \n\nRasitrio was studied in a double-blind, randomised, active-controlled study in 1,181 patients of which \n\n773 were classified as moderately hypertensive (msSBP 160-180 mmHg) and 408 as severely \n\nhypertensive (msSBP >180 mmHg) at baseline. A large number of patients were obese (49%) and \n\nover 14% of the total population had diabetes. During the first 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, \n\npatients received triple combination aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 150/5/12.5 mg \n\n(N=308), or dual combinations of aliskiren/HCTZ 150/12.5 mg (N=295), aliskiren/amlodipine \n\n150/5 mg (N=282) and amlodipine/HCTZ 5/12.5 mg (N=295). Patients were force-titrated to higher \n\ndoses after 4 weeks for an additional 4 weeks of double-blind treatment to aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n300/10/25 mg, aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg, aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg and amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n10/25 mg. \n\n \n\nIn this study, Rasitrio at a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced statistically significant mean blood \n\npressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from baseline of 37.9/20.6 mmHg compared to \n\n31.4/18.0 mmHg with aliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 28.0/14.3 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 30.8/17.0 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. In patients with severe hypertension \n\n(SBP ≥180 mmHg), the reduction in blood pressure from baseline for Rasitrio and the dual \n\ncombinations respectively was 49.5/22.5 mmHg compared to 38.1/17.6 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 33.2/14.3 mmHg with aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/25 mg) and 39.9/17.8 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (10/25 mg). In a subset of \n\n588 patients in which patients >65 years were scarcely represented and those aged >75 years were \n\nvery scarcely represented, the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/10/25 mg) produced a systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure reduction of 39.7/21.1 mmHg from \n\nbaseline, compared to 31.3/18.74 mmHg for aliskiren/amlodipine (300/10 mg), 25.5/12.5 mmHg for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 29.2/16.4 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, defined as a difference between \n\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) readings ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). The effect of Rasitrio was \n\nobserved as early as one week after initiation of therapy. The blood-pressure-lowering effect in \n\npatients with moderate to severe hypertension was independent of age, gender, race, body mass index \n\nand overweight-associated disorders (metabolic syndrome and diabetes). \n\n \n\nRasitrio was associated with a significant reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA) (-34%) from \n\nbaseline while the dual combination of amlodipine with hydrochlorothiazide increased PRA (+170%). \n\nThe clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nIn a 28 to 54 week open label safety study, efficacy was measured as secondary endpoint and Rasitrio \n\nat a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced mean blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) of \n\n37.3/21.8 mmHg over 28 to 54 weeks of treatment. Efficacy of Rasitrio was maintained over one year \n\nof treatment, with no evidence of loss of effect. \n\n \n\nIn a randomised, double blind, active controlled, 36-week study in elderly patients whose blood \n\npressure was not controlled with aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg (SBP ≥140 mmHg), clinically \n\nmeaningful further BP reduction was seen at week 36 endpoint for patients who received Rasitrio at a \n\ndose of 300/10/25 mg (from reductions in msSBP/msDBP of 15.0/8.6 mmHg at week 22 to reductions \n\nof 30.8/14.1 mmHg at week 36 endpoint). \n\n \n\nRasitrio has been administered to more than 1,155 patients in completed clinical trials, including \n\n182 patients for one year or more. Treatment with Rasitrio was well tolerated at doses up to \n\n300 mg/10 mg/25 mg with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations, except for symptomatic hypotension. The incidence of any adverse reactions \n\npotentially related to hypotension in a short-term controlled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to \n\n3.7% with dual combinations. In patients ≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up \n\nto 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of adverse events did not show any association with gender, age (with the exception of \n\nsymptomatic hypotension), body mass index, race or ethnicity. Adverse events have generally been \n\nmild and transient in nature. Very limited safety data are available for patients aged >75 years or \n\npatients with major cardiovascular co-morbidities. Discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical \n\nadverse event occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with Rasitrio versus 2.4% in aliskiren/amlodipine, \n\n0.7% in aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.7% in amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other medicinal products that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with \n\naliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions \n\nwere found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive medicinal products. The clinical \n\nimplications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \n\nethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n\n75 years or older. \n\n \n\nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to other \n\nclasses of antihypertensive medicinal products including selected ACEI and ARB. Compared to a \n\ndiuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ), aliskiren 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n\n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n22 \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \n\ntolerated. Aliskiren induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12-week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn an 8-week study in 754 hypertensive geriatric patients aged 65 years or older and geriatric patients \n\naged 75 years or older (30%) aliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically \n\nsignificant superior reduction in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to \n\nplacebo. No additional blood pressure lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared \n\nto 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive medicinal products. With cessation of \n\ntreatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, \n\nwith no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nStudy results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.11 in favour of placebo (95% \n\nConfidence Interval: 1.00, 1.23, 2-sided p=0.05). In addition, an increased incidence of adverse events \n\nwas observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (37.9% versus 30.2%). In particular there was an \n\nincreased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.0% versus 12.1%), hyperkalaemia (38.9% versus \n\n28.8%), hypotension-related events (19.7% versus 16.2%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints (3.4% \n\nversus 2.6%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n23 \n\nEffects of aliskiren on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nNo long-term efficacy data for aliskiren in patients with heart failure are currently available (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Rasitrio inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac \n\nand vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \n\ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance \n\nand in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and \n\nnon-dihydropyridine binding sites. \n\n \n\nThe contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the \n\nmovement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilatation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in \n\nblood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine \n\nlevels with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, \n\nvasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with heart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n24 \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% vs. 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was no \n\nsignificant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRasitrio in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nFollowing oral administration of a fixed combination tablet of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, peak concentrations were achieved for aliskiren within 1-2 hours, for amlodipine \n\nwithin 8 hours and for hydrochlorothiazide within 2-3 hours. The rate and extent of absorption of \n\naliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide following administration of a fixed combination tablet \n\nare similar to when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\n \n\nThe results from a food effect study using a standard high-fat meal with the 300/10/25 mg fixed \n\ncombination tablet showed that food reduced the rate and extent of absorption of aliskiren in the fixed \n\ncombination tablet with a similar magnitude of effect as for aliskiren monotherapy. Food had no \n\neffect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide in the fixed combination tablet. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC 0-\n\ntau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with \n\nthe initial dose. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n25 \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \n\nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \n\nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, mean plasma clearance is \n\napproximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients (aged \n\n6-17 years) given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules \n\n(3.125 mg/tablet), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The available data did \n\nnot suggest that age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren systemic exposure \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated as between 64% \n\nand 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, with \n\n10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n\n30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 5 mg and 10 mg. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRasitrio is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nDue to its hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in patients with anuria or severe \n\nrenal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). No adjustment of the initial dose is \n\nrequired in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of aliskiren with \n\nARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs expected for a compound which is cleared almost exclusively via the kidneys, renal function has a \n\nmarked effect on the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide. In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak \n\nplasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is \n\nreduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide \n\nAUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n27 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting \n\nincrease in AUC of approximately 40-60%. Therefore caution should be exercised in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients \n\nNo data are available on systemic exposure after administration of Rasitrio in geriatric patients. When \n\nadministered alone, the AUC of aliskiren in geriatric subjects (>65 years) is 50% higher than in young \n\nsubjects. The time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and \n\nyounger subjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and \n\nelimination half-life in geriatric patients. Therefore particular caution is recommended when \n\nadministering Rasitrio to patients aged 65 years and over, and extreme caution in patients aged \n\n75 years or older (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. There are no specific data \n\nregarding the effect of hydrochlorothiazide in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rasitrio have not been investigated. A population pharmacokinetic study has \n\nbeen conducted in 74 hypertensive children aged from 1 to 17 years (with 34 patients aged 6 to \n\n12 years and 28 patients aged 13 to 17 years) receiving amlodipine between 1.25 and 20 mg given \n\neither once or twice daily. In children 6 to 12 years and in adolescents 13-17 years of age the typical \n\noral clearance (CL/F) was 22.5 and 27.4 l/hr respectively in males and 16.4 and 21.3 l/hr respectively \n\nin females. Large variability in exposure between individuals was observed. Data reported in children \n\nbelow 6 years are limited. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nNon-clinical studies of the toxicology of Rasitrio alone have not been conducted as these studies have \n\nbeen conducted for the individual components. \n\n \n\nThe toxicity profiles of the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nhave been well characterised in preclinical studies. Both combinations were generally well tolerated \n\nby rats. The findings from 2- and 13-week oral toxicity studies were consistent with those for the \n\nindividual components. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n28 \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nSafety data for amlodipine are well established both clinically and non-clinically. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no effects related to the medicinal product at either the gene or \n\nchromosome levels. \n\n \n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies \n\nwherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg,/day \n\nrespectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRasitrio 300 mg/5 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate), 5 mg amlodipine (as besylate) \n\nand 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nLight pink, ovaloid convex film-coated tablet with bevelled edges, with “LIL” debossed on one side \n\nand “NVR” on the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasitrio is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult \n\npatients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasitrio is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets given \n\nconcurrently at the same time of the day may be switched to a fixed combination tablet of Rasitrio \n\ncontaining the same component doses. \n\n \n\nThe fixed dose combination should only be used after a stable effect on the monocomponents, given \n\nconcurrently, has been established after dose titration. Dose should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly patients aged 65 years and over \n\nThere is evidence of an increased risk of adverse events related to hypotension in patients aged \n\n65 years or older treated with Rasitrio. Therefore, particular caution should be exercised when \n\nadministering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or over. \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in this group of patients is 150 mg. No clinically \n\nmeaningful additional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the \n\nmajority of elderly patients. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n32 \n\nElderly patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older (see \n\nsection 5.2). The use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older should be restricted to patients for \n\nwhom blood pressure control has been established for the free combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently without accompanying safety concerns, in particular \n\nhypotension. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is \n\nrecommended (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 89-60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n and 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n, \n\nrespectively) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated for use in patients with anuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). The concomitant use of Rasitrio with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) or \n\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment \n\n(GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen administering Rasitrio in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or patients with \n\nprogressive liver disease. No dosage recommendations have been established for amlodipine in \n\npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasitrio in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasitrio should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Rasitrio (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to \n\nother dihydropyridine derivatives, or to other sulphonamide-derived substances. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n Anuria. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n Hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, symptomatic hyperuricaemia and refractory hypokalaemia. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\n\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n33 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasitrio therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients \n\nwith ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial \n\ninfarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in \n\npatients with allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. Close monitoring of blood pressure, renal \n\nfunction and electrolytes should be exercised if co-administration is considered absolutely necessary. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 65 years and over \n\nParticular caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or older. \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. Patients aged \n\n65 years old or over, are more susceptible to hypotension-related adverse reactions following \n\ntreatment with Rasitrio (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited efficacy and safety data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or \n\nolder. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended (see \n\nsections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nNo data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are available for Rasitrio in patients with heart \n\nfailure (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n34 \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasitrio in the following \n\ncases: \n\n Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \n\ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \n\nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasitrio, or the treatment \n\nshould start under close medical supervision. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Rasitrio should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Rasitrio should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nHypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in \n\npatients with cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3, 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Rasitrio therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that Rasitrio would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \n\ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n35 \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Rasitrio is \n\nused in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. No data is available in hypertensive \n\npatients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \n\n≥177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in men and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension. Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) or \n\nanuria (see sections 4.2. and 4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \n\nrenal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the RAAS, caution should be exercised when Rasitrio is \n\ngiven in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver \n\ndisease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren \n\nin post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Rasitrio in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation, therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 \n\nand 5.2). Caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio to patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment or progressive liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe half life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \n\nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated when using amlodipine in patients suffering \n\nfrom aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dose adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic medicinal products may be required during Rasitrio therapy. Concomitant use of \n\nRasitrio with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n36 \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal products \n\nacting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, \n\nincluding acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. \n\nTherefore caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system (RAAS), angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the \n\nface, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal products that can cause angioedema, including \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasitrio should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Rasitrio, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is \n\nto discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may \n\nneed to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing \n\nacute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n37 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio interactions \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with hypertension did not indicate any clinically \n\nrelevant changes in the steady-state exposure (AUC) and Cmax of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide compared to the corresponding dual therapies. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels: The potassium-depleting effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal \n\nproducts associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \n\ncorticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocoricotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents affecting the \n\nRAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, \n\npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum \n\npotassium. If co-medication with an agent affecting the level of serum potassium is considered \n\nnecessary, caution is advisable. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not \n\nrecommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: Periodic monitoring of serum \n\npotassium is recommended when Rasitrio is administered with medicinal products affected by serum \n\npotassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs: As with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may \n\nalso weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the use of \n\nRasitrio with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nInformation on aliskiren interactions \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n- Dual RAAS blockade \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- P-glycoprotein (P-gp) potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \n\nCo-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is \n\nlikely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by \n\ngrapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, \n\ngrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasitrio. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- P-gp interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced \n\naliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s \n\nwort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has not been investigated for \n\naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp \n\ninhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may \n\nincrease tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will \n\nlikely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\n- Moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \n\nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-administration with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination \n\nof aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal \n\nimpairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- Furosemide and torasemide \n\nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see interaction with organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n- Warfarin \n\nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\n- Food interactions \n\nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n\n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of aliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nInformation on amlodipine interactions \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on amlodipine \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \n\nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \n\nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n40 \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\n- Dantrolene (infusion) \n\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nEffects of amlodipine on other medicinal products \n\n- The blood pressure lowering effects of amlodipine add to the blood pressure lowering effects of \n\nother antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in \n\na 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to \n\nlimit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, \n\ndigoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nInformation on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nNot recommended \n\n- Lithium \n\nRenal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may be \n\nincreased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- Alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics \nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances that also have a blood pressure \n\nlowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system activity or direct vasodilatation) \n\nmay potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\n- Amantadine \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions caused by \n\namantadine. \n\n \n\n- Antidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be \n\nnecessary (see section 4.4). Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk of lactic \n\nacidosis induced by possible functional renal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n41 \n\n- Anticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. \n\natropine, biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach \n\nemptying rate. Conversely, it is anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease \n\nthe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products used in the treatment of gout \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise \n\nthe level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-\n\nadministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when \n\nassociated with medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and \n\nClass III antiarrhythmics and some antipsychotics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum sodium level \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified by concomitant administration of medicinal \n\nproducts such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term \n\nadministration of these medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Beta blockers and diazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase \n\nthe risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the \n\nhyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\n- Ion exchange resins \n\nAbsorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. However, staggering the \n\ndosage of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n \n\n- Vitamin D and calcium salts \n\nAdministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with vitamin D or with calcium \n\nsalts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide type diuretics may lead to \n\nhypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or \n\nvitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. \n\n \n\n- Non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the action of skeletal muscle relaxants such as \n\ncurare derivatives. \n\n \n\n- Cytotoxic agents \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\n- Digoxine or digitalis glycosides \n\nThiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of digitalis-induced cardiac \n\narrhythmias (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n- Methyldopa \n\nThere have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n42 \n\n- Iodine contrasting agents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute renal failure, especially \n\nwith high doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before administration. \n\n \n\n- Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical \n\nsignificance of this effect is uncertain and not sufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\nHealthcare professionals prescribing Rasitrio should counsel women of childbearing potential about \n\nthe potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment \n\nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasitrio should not be used in women \n\nplanning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \n\nsystem have been associated with serious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any \n\nmedicinal product that acts directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, aliskiren should not \n\nbe used during the first trimester of pregnancy and is contraindicated during the second and third \n\ntrimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. Reproductive studies in rats \n\nhave shown no toxicity except for delayed date of delivery and prolonged duration of labour at \n\ndosages 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans (see section 5.3). Use \n\nin pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself \n\ncarries greater risk for the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nRasitrio should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasitrio is contraindicated during \n\nthe second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasitrio should be discontinued accordingly as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was \n\nsecreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n43 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Rasitrio during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Rasitrio is used during breast-\n\nfeeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility with the use of Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\nThe fertility of rats was unaffected at doses of up to aliskiren 250 mg/kg/day and hydrochlorothiazide \n\n4 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \n\nwhen driving vehicles or using machines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may \n\noccasionally occur when taking Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \n\ntaking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, drowsiness, headache, fatigue or nausea, the ability to react \n\nmay be impaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nThe safety profile of Rasitrio presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Rasitrio and \n\nthe known safety profile of the individual components aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nSafety information for Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions observed with Rasitrio are hypotension and dizziness. The \n\nadverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components of Rasitrio (aliskiren, \n\namlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide) and listed in the respective paragraphs on the individual \n\ncomponents may occur with Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse reactions for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide are ranked under heading of \n\nfrequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Common Hypotension \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common Peripheral oedema \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n44 \n\nPeripheral oedema is a known, dose-dependent adverse reaction of amlodipine and has also been \n\nreported with aliskiren therapy in post-marketing experience. The incidence of peripheral oedema for \n\nRasitrio in a short-term double active-controlled study was 7.1% compared to 8.0% for \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, 4.1% for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.0% for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of any adverse reactions potentially related to hypotension in a short-term active \n\ncontrolled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to 3.7% with dual combinations. In patients \n\n≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up to 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\nOther adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with \n\nRasitrio even if not observed in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nSerious adverse reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which have been reported in \n\npost-marketing experience and may occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). The most \n\ncommon adverse reaction is diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe known aliskiren adverse reactions are presented in the table below using the same convention as \n\ndescribed previously for the fixed combination. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare Anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\n Uncommon Palpitations, oedema peripheral \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon Hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Uncommon Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common Diarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Not known Liver disorder*, jaundice, hepatitis, liver failure** \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens \n\nJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), oral mucosal \n\nreactions, rash, pruritus, urticaria \n\n Rare Angioedema, erythema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Uncommon Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nInvestigations \n\n Common Hyperkalaemia \n\n Uncommon Liver enzyme increased \n\n Rare Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased, blood creatinine \n\nincreased \n\n*Isolated cases of liver disorder with clinical symptoms and laboratory evidence of more marked \n\nhepatic dysfunction. \n\n**Including one case of ‘liver failure fulminant’ reported in the post-marketing experience, for which \n\na causal relationship with aliskiren cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n45 \n\nDescription of selected adverse events: \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have occurred during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing, or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations: In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory \n\nparameters were uncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in \n\nhypertensive patients, aliskiren had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density \n\nlipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other medicinal products acting on \n\nthe RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n<60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: Based on the limited amount of safety data available from a pharmacokinetic \n\nstudy of aliskiren treatment in 39 hypertensive children 6-17 years of age, the frequency, type and \n\nseverity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar to that seen in hypertensive adults. \n\nAs for other RAAS blockers, headache is a common adverse event in children treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n46 \n\nAmlodipine \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nVery rare Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nVery rare Allergic reactions \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery rare Hyperglycaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nUncommon Insomnia, mood changes (including anxiety), depression \n\nRare Confusion \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Somnolence, headache (especially at the beginning of treatment) \n\nUncommon Tremor, dysgeusia, syncope, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia \n\nVery rare Hypertonia, peripheral neuropathy \n\nEye disorders \n\nUncommon Visual disturbance (including diplopia) \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nUncommon Tinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon Palpitations \n\nVery rare Myocardial infarction, arrhythmia (including bradycardia, \n\nventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon Flushing \n\nVery rare Vasculitis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Dyspnoea, rhinitis \n\nVery rare Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Abdominal pain, nausea \n\nUncommon Vomiting, dyspepsia, altered bowel habits (including diarrhoea and \n\nconstipation), dry mouth \n\nVery rare Pancreatitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nVery rare Hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic enzymes increased (mostly consistent \n\nwith cholestasis) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Alopecia, purpura, skin decolouration, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, rash, \n\nexanthema \n\nVery rare Angioedema, erythema multiforme, urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome, Quincke oedema, photosensitivity \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Ankle swelling \n\nUncommon Arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, back pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nUncommon Micturition disorder, nocturia, increased urinary frequency \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nUncommon Impotence, gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Oedema, fatigue \n\nUncommon Chest pain, asthenia, pain, malaise \n\nInvestigations \n\nUncommon Weight increase, weight decrease \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nExceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Rasitrio.

Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension \n\nup to and including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur with Rasitrio, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdose calls for active cardiovascular support \n\nincluding frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities and \n\nattention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \n\n \n\nA vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is \n\nno contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the \n\neffects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to \n\n2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of \n\namlodipine. \n\n \n\nSince amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (<2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n49 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, renin-inhibitors; ATC \n\ncode C09XA54 \n\n \n\nRasitrio combines three antihypertensive active substances with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: aliskiren belongs to the direct renin \n\ninhibitor class, amlodipine to the calcium channel blocker class and hydrochlorothiazide to the \n\nthiazide diuretics class. When combined, the consolidated effects of inhibition of the renin-\n\nangiotensin-aldosterone system, calcium channel-mediated vasodilatation and sodium chloride \n\nexcretion result in a reduction of blood pressure to a greater degree than the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Rasitrio provided clinically meaningful \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The greater blood pressure reduction for Rasitrio over each dual combination was seen \n\nat every hour including the early morning hours with the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure \n\nmonitoring. \n\n \n\nRasitrio was studied in a double-blind, randomised, active-controlled study in 1,181 patients of which \n\n773 were classified as moderately hypertensive (msSBP 160-180 mmHg) and 408 as severely \n\nhypertensive (msSBP >180 mmHg) at baseline. A large number of patients were obese (49%) and \n\nover 14% of the total population had diabetes. During the first 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, \n\npatients received triple combination aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 150/5/12.5 mg \n\n(N=308), or dual combinations of aliskiren/HCTZ 150/12.5 mg (N=295), aliskiren/amlodipine \n\n150/5 mg (N=282) and amlodipine/HCTZ 5/12.5 mg (N=295). Patients were force-titrated to higher \n\ndoses after 4 weeks for an additional 4 weeks of double-blind treatment to aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n300/10/25 mg, aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg, aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg and amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n10/25 mg. \n\n \n\nIn this study, Rasitrio at a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced statistically significant mean blood \n\npressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from baseline of 37.9/20.6 mmHg compared to \n\n31.4/18.0 mmHg with aliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 28.0/14.3 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 30.8/17.0 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. In patients with severe hypertension \n\n(SBP ≥180 mmHg), the reduction in blood pressure from baseline for Rasitrio and the dual \n\ncombinations respectively was 49.5/22.5 mmHg compared to 38.1/17.6 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 33.2/14.3 mmHg with aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/25 mg) and 39.9/17.8 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (10/25 mg). In a subset of \n\n588 patients in which patients >65 years were scarcely represented and those aged >75 years were \n\nvery scarcely represented, the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/10/25 mg) produced a systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure reduction of 39.7/21.1 mmHg from \n\nbaseline, compared to 31.3/18.74 mmHg for aliskiren/amlodipine (300/10 mg), 25.5/12.5 mmHg for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 29.2/16.4 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, defined as a difference between \n\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) readings ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). The effect of Rasitrio was \n\nobserved as early as one week after initiation of therapy. The blood-pressure-lowering effect in \n\npatients with moderate to severe hypertension was independent of age, gender, race, body mass index \n\nand overweight-associated disorders (metabolic syndrome and diabetes). \n\n \n\nRasitrio was associated with a significant reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA) (-34%) from \n\nbaseline while the dual combination of amlodipine with hydrochlorothiazide increased PRA (+170%). \n\nThe clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nIn a 28 to 54 week open label safety study, efficacy was measured as secondary endpoint and Rasitrio \n\nat a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced mean blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) of \n\n37.3/21.8 mmHg over 28 to 54 weeks of treatment. Efficacy of Rasitrio was maintained over one year \n\nof treatment, with no evidence of loss of effect. \n\n \n\nIn a randomised, double blind, active controlled, 36-week study in elderly patients whose blood \n\npressure was not controlled with aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg (SBP ≥140 mmHg), clinically \n\nmeaningful further BP reduction was seen at week 36 endpoint for patients who received Rasitrio at a \n\ndose of 300/10/25 mg (from reductions in msSBP/msDBP of 15.0/8.6 mmHg at week 22 to reductions \n\nof 30.8/14.1 mmHg at week 36 endpoint). \n\n \n\nRasitrio has been administered to more than 1,155 patients in completed clinical trials, including \n\n182 patients for one year or more. Treatment with Rasitrio was well tolerated at doses up to \n\n300 mg/10 mg/25 mg with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations, except for symptomatic hypotension. The incidence of any adverse reactions \n\npotentially related to hypotension in a short-term controlled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to \n\n3.7% with dual combinations. In patients ≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up \n\nto 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of adverse events did not show any association with gender, age (with the exception of \n\nsymptomatic hypotension), body mass index, race or ethnicity. Adverse events have generally been \n\nmild and transient in nature. Very limited safety data are available for patients aged >75 years or \n\npatients with major cardiovascular co-morbidities. Discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical \n\nadverse event occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with Rasitrio versus 2.4% in aliskiren/amlodipine, \n\n0.7% in aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.7% in amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other medicinal products that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with \n\naliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions \n\nwere found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive medicinal products. The clinical \n\nimplications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \n\nethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n\n75 years or older. \n\n \n\nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to other \n\nclasses of antihypertensive medicinal products including selected ACEI and ARB. Compared to a \n\ndiuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ), aliskiren 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n\n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n51 \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \n\ntolerated. Aliskiren induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12-week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn an 8-week study in 754 hypertensive geriatric patients aged 65 years or older and geriatric patients \n\naged 75 years or older (30%) aliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically \n\nsignificant superior reduction in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to \n\nplacebo. No additional blood pressure lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared \n\nto 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive medicinal products. With cessation of \n\ntreatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, \n\nwith no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nStudy results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.11 in favour of placebo (95% \n\nConfidence Interval: 1.00, 1.23, 2-sided p=0.05). In addition, an increased incidence of adverse events \n\nwas observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (37.9% versus 30.2%). In particular there was an \n\nincreased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.0% versus 12.1%), hyperkalaemia (38.9% versus \n\n28.8%), hypotension-related events (19.7% versus 16.2%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints (3.4% \n\nversus 2.6%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nEffects of aliskiren on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nNo long-term efficacy data for aliskiren in patients with heart failure are currently available (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Rasitrio inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac \n\nand vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \n\ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance \n\nand in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and \n\nnon-dihydropyridine binding sites. \n\n \n\nThe contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the \n\nmovement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilatation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in \n\nblood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine \n\nlevels with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, \n\nvasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with heart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n53 \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% vs. 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was no \n\nsignificant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRasitrio in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nFollowing oral administration of a fixed combination tablet of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, peak concentrations were achieved for aliskiren within 1-2 hours, for amlodipine \n\nwithin 8 hours and for hydrochlorothiazide within 2-3 hours. The rate and extent of absorption of \n\naliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide following administration of a fixed combination tablet \n\nare similar to when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\n \n\nThe results from a food effect study using a standard high-fat meal with the 300/10/25 mg fixed \n\ncombination tablet showed that food reduced the rate and extent of absorption of aliskiren in the fixed \n\ncombination tablet with a similar magnitude of effect as for aliskiren monotherapy. Food had no \n\neffect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide in the fixed combination tablet. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC 0-\n\ntau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with \n\nthe initial dose. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n54 \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \n\nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \n\nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, mean plasma clearance is \n\napproximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients (aged \n\n6-17 years) given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules \n\n(3.125 mg/tablet), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The available data did \n\nnot suggest that age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren systemic exposure \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated as between 64% \n\nand 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, with \n\n10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n\n30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 5 mg and 10 mg. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n55 \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRasitrio is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nDue to its hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in patients with anuria or severe \n\nrenal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). No adjustment of the initial dose is \n\nrequired in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of aliskiren with \n\nARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs expected for a compound which is cleared almost exclusively via the kidneys, renal function has a \n\nmarked effect on the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide. In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak \n\nplasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is \n\nreduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide \n\nAUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n56 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting \n\nincrease in AUC of approximately 40-60%. Therefore caution should be exercised in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients \n\nNo data are available on systemic exposure after administration of Rasitrio in geriatric patients. When \n\nadministered alone, the AUC of aliskiren in geriatric subjects (>65 years) is 50% higher than in young \n\nsubjects. The time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and \n\nyounger subjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and \n\nelimination half-life in geriatric patients. Therefore particular caution is recommended when \n\nadministering Rasitrio to patients aged 65 years and over, and extreme caution in patients aged \n\n75 years or older (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. There are no specific data \n\nregarding the effect of hydrochlorothiazide in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rasitrio have not been investigated. A population pharmacokinetic study has \n\nbeen conducted in 74 hypertensive children aged from 1 to 17 years (with 34 patients aged 6 to \n\n12 years and 28 patients aged 13 to 17 years) receiving amlodipine between 1.25 and 20 mg given \n\neither once or twice daily. In children 6 to 12 years and in adolescents 13-17 years of age the typical \n\noral clearance (CL/F) was 22.5 and 27.4 l/hr respectively in males and 16.4 and 21.3 l/hr respectively \n\nin females. Large variability in exposure between individuals was observed. Data reported in children \n\nbelow 6 years are limited. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nNon-clinical studies of the toxicology of Rasitrio alone have not been conducted as these studies have \n\nbeen conducted for the individual components. \n\n \n\nThe toxicity profiles of the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nhave been well characterised in preclinical studies. Both combinations were generally well tolerated \n\nby rats. The findings from 2- and 13-week oral toxicity studies were consistent with those for the \n\nindividual components. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n57 \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nSafety data for amlodipine are well established both clinically and non-clinically. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no effects related to the medicinal product at either the gene or \n\nchromosome levels. \n\n \n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies \n\nwherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg,/day \n\nrespectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. These doses of hydrochlorothiazide in mice \n\nand rats represent 19 and 1.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n \n\nbasis.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRasitrio 300 mg/5 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate), 5 mg amlodipine (as besylate) \n\nand 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nPale orange-brown, ovaloid convex film-coated tablet with bevelled edges, with “OIO” debossed on \n\none side and “NVR” on the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasitrio is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult \n\npatients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasitrio is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets given \n\nconcurrently at the same time of the day may be switched to a fixed combination tablet of Rasitrio \n\ncontaining the same component doses. \n\n \n\nThe fixed dose combination should only be used after a stable effect on the monocomponents, given \n\nconcurrently, has been established after dose titration. Dose should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly patients aged 65 years and over \n\nThere is evidence of an increased risk of adverse events related to hypotension in patients aged \n\n65 years or older treated with Rasitrio. Therefore, particular caution should be exercised when \n\nadministering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or over. \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in this group of patients is 150 mg. No clinically \n\nmeaningful additional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the \n\nmajority of elderly patients. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n61 \n\nElderly patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older (see \n\nsection 5.2). The use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older should be restricted to patients for \n\nwhom blood pressure control has been established for the free combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently without accompanying safety concerns, in particular \n\nhypotension. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is \n\nrecommended (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 89-60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n and 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n, \n\nrespectively) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated for use in patients with anuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). The concomitant use of Rasitrio with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) or \n\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment \n\n(GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen administering Rasitrio in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or patients with \n\nprogressive liver disease. No dosage recommendations have been established for amlodipine in \n\npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasitrio in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasitrio should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Rasitrio (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to \n\nother dihydropyridine derivatives, or to other sulphonamide-derived substances. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n Anuria. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n Hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, symptomatic hyperuricaemia and refractory hypokalaemia. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\n\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n62 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasitrio therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients \n\nwith ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial \n\ninfarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in \n\npatients with allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. Close monitoring of blood pressure, renal \n\nfunction and electrolytes should be exercised if co-administration is considered absolutely necessary. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 65 years and over \n\nParticular caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or older. \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. Patients aged \n\n65 years old or over, are more susceptible to hypotension-related adverse reactions following \n\ntreatment with Rasitrio (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited efficacy and safety data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or \n\nolder. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended (see \n\nsections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nNo data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are available for Rasitrio in patients with heart \n\nfailure (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n63 \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasitrio in the following \n\ncases: \n\n Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \n\ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \n\nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasitrio, or the treatment \n\nshould start under close medical supervision. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Rasitrio should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Rasitrio should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nHypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in \n\npatients with cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3, 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Rasitrio therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that Rasitrio would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \n\ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n64 \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Rasitrio is \n\nused in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. No data is available in hypertensive \n\npatients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \n\n≥177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in men and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension. Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) or \n\nanuria (see sections 4.2. and 4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \n\nrenal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the RAAS, caution should be exercised when Rasitrio is \n\ngiven in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver \n\ndisease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren \n\nin post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Rasitrio in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation, therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 \n\nand 5.2). Caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio to patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment or progressive liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe half life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \n\nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated when using amlodipine in patients suffering \n\nfrom aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dose adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic medicinal products may be required during Rasitrio therapy. Concomitant use of \n\nRasitrio with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n65 \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal products \n\nacting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, \n\nincluding acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. \n\nTherefore caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system (RAAS), angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the \n\nface, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal products that can cause angioedema, including \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasitrio should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Rasitrio, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is \n\nto discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may \n\nneed to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing \n\nacute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n66 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio interactions \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with hypertension did not indicate any clinically \n\nrelevant changes in the steady-state exposure (AUC) and Cmax of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide compared to the corresponding dual therapies. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels: The potassium-depleting effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal \n\nproducts associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \n\ncorticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocoricotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents affecting the \n\nRAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, \n\npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum \n\npotassium. If co-medication with an agent affecting the level of serum potassium is considered \n\nnecessary, caution is advisable. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not \n\nrecommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: Periodic monitoring of serum \n\npotassium is recommended when Rasitrio is administered with medicinal products affected by serum \n\npotassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs: As with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may \n\nalso weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the use of \n\nRasitrio with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nInformation on aliskiren interactions \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n- Dual RAAS blockade \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- P-glycoprotein (P-gp) potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \n\nCo-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is \n\nlikely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by \n\ngrapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, \n\ngrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasitrio. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- P-gp interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced \n\naliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s \n\nwort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has not been investigated for \n\naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp \n\ninhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may \n\nincrease tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will \n\nlikely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\n- Moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \n\nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-administration with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination \n\nof aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal \n\nimpairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- Furosemide and torasemide \n\nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see interaction with organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n- Warfarin \n\nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\n- Food interactions \n\nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n\n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of aliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nInformation on amlodipine interactions \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on amlodipine \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \n\nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \n\nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n69 \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\n- Dantrolene (infusion) \n\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nEffects of amlodipine on other medicinal products \n\n- The blood pressure lowering effects of amlodipine add to the blood pressure lowering effects of \n\nother antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in \n\na 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to \n\nlimit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, \n\ndigoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nInformation on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nNot recommended \n\n- Lithium \n\nRenal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may be \n\nincreased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- Alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics \nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances that also have a blood pressure \n\nlowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system activity or direct vasodilatation) \n\nmay potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\n- Amantadine \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions caused by \n\namantadine. \n\n \n\n- Antidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be \n\nnecessary (see section 4.4). Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk of lactic \n\nacidosis induced by possible functional renal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n70 \n\n- Anticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. \n\natropine, biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach \n\nemptying rate. Conversely, it is anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease \n\nthe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products used in the treatment of gout \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise \n\nthe level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-\n\nadministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when \n\nassociated with medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and \n\nClass III antiarrhythmics and some antipsychotics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum sodium level \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified by concomitant administration of medicinal \n\nproducts such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term \n\nadministration of these medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Beta blockers and diazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase \n\nthe risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the \n\nhyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\n- Ion exchange resins \n\nAbsorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. However, staggering the \n\ndosage of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n \n\n- Vitamin D and calcium salts \n\nAdministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with vitamin D or with calcium \n\nsalts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide type diuretics may lead to \n\nhypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or \n\nvitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. \n\n \n\n- Non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the action of skeletal muscle relaxants such as \n\ncurare derivatives. \n\n \n\n- Cytotoxic agents \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\n- Digoxine or digitalis glycosides \n\nThiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of digitalis-induced cardiac \n\narrhythmias (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n- Methyldopa \n\nThere have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n71 \n\n- Iodine contrasting agents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute renal failure, especially \n\nwith high doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before administration. \n\n \n\n- Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical \n\nsignificance of this effect is uncertain and not sufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\nHealthcare professionals prescribing Rasitrio should counsel women of childbearing potential about \n\nthe potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment \n\nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasitrio should not be used in women \n\nplanning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \n\nsystem have been associated with serious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any \n\nmedicinal product that acts directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, aliskiren should not \n\nbe used during the first trimester of pregnancy and is contraindicated during the second and third \n\ntrimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. Reproductive studies in rats \n\nhave shown no toxicity except for delayed date of delivery and prolonged duration of labour at \n\ndosages 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans (see section 5.3). Use \n\nin pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself \n\ncarries greater risk for the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nRasitrio should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasitrio is contraindicated during \n\nthe second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasitrio should be discontinued accordingly as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was \n\nsecreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n72 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Rasitrio during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Rasitrio is used during breast-\n\nfeeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility with the use of Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\nThe fertility of rats was unaffected at doses of up to aliskiren 250 mg/kg/day and hydrochlorothiazide \n\n4 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \n\nwhen driving vehicles or using machines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may \n\noccasionally occur when taking Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \n\ntaking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, drowsiness, headache, fatigue or nausea, the ability to react \n\nmay be impaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nThe safety profile of Rasitrio presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Rasitrio and \n\nthe known safety profile of the individual components aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nSafety information for Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions observed with Rasitrio are hypotension and dizziness. The \n\nadverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components of Rasitrio (aliskiren, \n\namlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide) and listed in the respective paragraphs on the individual \n\ncomponents may occur with Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse reactions for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide are ranked under heading of \n\nfrequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Common Hypotension \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common Peripheral oedema \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n73 \n\nPeripheral oedema is a known, dose-dependent adverse reaction of amlodipine and has also been \n\nreported with aliskiren therapy in post-marketing experience. The incidence of peripheral oedema for \n\nRasitrio in a short-term double active-controlled study was 7.1% compared to 8.0% for \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, 4.1% for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.0% for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of any adverse reactions potentially related to hypotension in a short-term active \n\ncontrolled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to 3.7% with dual combinations. In patients \n\n≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up to 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\nOther adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with \n\nRasitrio even if not observed in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nSerious adverse reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which have been reported in \n\npost-marketing experience and may occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). The most \n\ncommon adverse reaction is diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe known aliskiren adverse reactions are presented in the table below using the same convention as \n\ndescribed previously for the fixed combination. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare Anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\n Uncommon Palpitations, oedema peripheral \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon Hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Uncommon Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common Diarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Not known Liver disorder*, jaundice, hepatitis, liver failure** \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens \n\nJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), oral mucosal \n\nreactions, rash, pruritus, urticaria \n\n Rare Angioedema, erythema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Uncommon Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nInvestigations \n\n Common Hyperkalaemia \n\n Uncommon Liver enzyme increased \n\n Rare Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased, blood creatinine \n\nincreased \n\n*Isolated cases of liver disorder with clinical symptoms and laboratory evidence of more marked \n\nhepatic dysfunction. \n\n**Including one case of ‘liver failure fulminant’ reported in the post-marketing experience, for which \n\na causal relationship with aliskiren cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n74 \n\nDescription of selected adverse events: \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have occurred during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing, or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations: In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory \n\nparameters were uncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in \n\nhypertensive patients, aliskiren had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density \n\nlipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other medicinal products acting on \n\nthe RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n<60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: Based on the limited amount of safety data available from a pharmacokinetic \n\nstudy of aliskiren treatment in 39 hypertensive children 6-17 years of age, the frequency, type and \n\nseverity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar to that seen in hypertensive adults. \n\nAs for other RAAS blockers, headache is a common adverse event in children treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n75 \n\nAmlodipine \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nVery rare Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nVery rare Allergic reactions \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery rare Hyperglycaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nUncommon Insomnia, mood changes (including anxiety), depression \n\nRare Confusion \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Somnolence, headache (especially at the beginning of treatment) \n\nUncommon Tremor, dysgeusia, syncope, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia \n\nVery rare Hypertonia, peripheral neuropathy \n\nEye disorders \n\nUncommon Visual disturbance (including diplopia) \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nUncommon Tinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon Palpitations \n\nVery rare Myocardial infarction, arrhythmia (including bradycardia, \n\nventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon Flushing \n\nVery rare Vasculitis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Dyspnoea, rhinitis \n\nVery rare Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Abdominal pain, nausea \n\nUncommon Vomiting, dyspepsia, altered bowel habits (including diarrhoea and \n\nconstipation), dry mouth \n\nVery rare Pancreatitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nVery rare Hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic enzymes increased (mostly consistent \n\nwith cholestasis) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Alopecia, purpura, skin decolouration, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, rash, \n\nexanthema \n\nVery rare Angioedema, erythema multiforme, urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome, Quincke oedema, photosensitivity \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Ankle swelling \n\nUncommon Arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, back pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nUncommon Micturition disorder, nocturia, increased urinary frequency \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nUncommon Impotence, gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Oedema, fatigue \n\nUncommon Chest pain, asthenia, pain, malaise \n\nInvestigations \n\nUncommon Weight increase, weight decrease \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\nExceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Rasitrio.

Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension \n\nup to and including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur with Rasitrio, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdose calls for active cardiovascular support \n\nincluding frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities and \n\nattention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \n\n \n\nA vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is \n\nno contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the \n\neffects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to \n\n2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of \n\namlodipine. \n\n \n\nSince amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (<2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n78 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, renin-inhibitors; ATC \n\ncode C09XA54 \n\n \n\nRasitrio combines three antihypertensive active substances with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: aliskiren belongs to the direct renin \n\ninhibitor class, amlodipine to the calcium channel blocker class and hydrochlorothiazide to the \n\nthiazide diuretics class. When combined, the consolidated effects of inhibition of the renin-\n\nangiotensin-aldosterone system, calcium channel-mediated vasodilatation and sodium chloride \n\nexcretion result in a reduction of blood pressure to a greater degree than the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Rasitrio provided clinically meaningful \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The greater blood pressure reduction for Rasitrio over each dual combination was seen \n\nat every hour including the early morning hours with the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure \n\nmonitoring. \n\n \n\nRasitrio was studied in a double-blind, randomised, active-controlled study in 1,181 patients of which \n\n773 were classified as moderately hypertensive (msSBP 160-180 mmHg) and 408 as severely \n\nhypertensive (msSBP >180 mmHg) at baseline. A large number of patients were obese (49%) and \n\nover 14% of the total population had diabetes. During the first 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, \n\npatients received triple combination aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 150/5/12.5 mg \n\n(N=308), or dual combinations of aliskiren/HCTZ 150/12.5 mg (N=295), aliskiren/amlodipine \n\n150/5 mg (N=282) and amlodipine/HCTZ 5/12.5 mg (N=295). Patients were force-titrated to higher \n\ndoses after 4 weeks for an additional 4 weeks of double-blind treatment to aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n300/10/25 mg, aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg, aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg and amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n10/25 mg. \n\n \n\nIn this study, Rasitrio at a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced statistically significant mean blood \n\npressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from baseline of 37.9/20.6 mmHg compared to \n\n31.4/18.0 mmHg with aliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 28.0/14.3 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 30.8/17.0 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. In patients with severe hypertension \n\n(SBP ≥180 mmHg), the reduction in blood pressure from baseline for Rasitrio and the dual \n\ncombinations respectively was 49.5/22.5 mmHg compared to 38.1/17.6 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 33.2/14.3 mmHg with aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/25 mg) and 39.9/17.8 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (10/25 mg). In a subset of \n\n588 patients in which patients >65 years were scarcely represented and those aged >75 years were \n\nvery scarcely represented, the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/10/25 mg) produced a systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure reduction of 39.7/21.1 mmHg from \n\nbaseline, compared to 31.3/18.74 mmHg for aliskiren/amlodipine (300/10 mg), 25.5/12.5 mmHg for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 29.2/16.4 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, defined as a difference between \n\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) readings ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). The effect of Rasitrio was \n\nobserved as early as one week after initiation of therapy. The blood-pressure-lowering effect in \n\npatients with moderate to severe hypertension was independent of age, gender, race, body mass index \n\nand overweight-associated disorders (metabolic syndrome and diabetes). \n\n \n\nRasitrio was associated with a significant reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA) (-34%) from \n\nbaseline while the dual combination of amlodipine with hydrochlorothiazide increased PRA (+170%). \n\nThe clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nIn a 28 to 54 week open label safety study, efficacy was measured as secondary endpoint and Rasitrio \n\nat a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced mean blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) of \n\n37.3/21.8 mmHg over 28 to 54 weeks of treatment. Efficacy of Rasitrio was maintained over one year \n\nof treatment, with no evidence of loss of effect. \n\n \n\nIn a randomised, double blind, active controlled, 36-week study in elderly patients whose blood \n\npressure was not controlled with aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg (SBP ≥140 mmHg), clinically \n\nmeaningful further BP reduction was seen at week 36 endpoint for patients who received Rasitrio at a \n\ndose of 300/10/25 mg (from reductions in msSBP/msDBP of 15.0/8.6 mmHg at week 22 to reductions \n\nof 30.8/14.1 mmHg at week 36 endpoint). \n\n \n\nRasitrio has been administered to more than 1,155 patients in completed clinical trials, including \n\n182 patients for one year or more. Treatment with Rasitrio was well tolerated at doses up to \n\n300 mg/10 mg/25 mg with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations, except for symptomatic hypotension. The incidence of any adverse reactions \n\npotentially related to hypotension in a short-term controlled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to \n\n3.7% with dual combinations. In patients ≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up \n\nto 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of adverse events did not show any association with gender, age (with the exception of \n\nsymptomatic hypotension), body mass index, race or ethnicity. Adverse events have generally been \n\nmild and transient in nature. Very limited safety data are available for patients aged >75 years or \n\npatients with major cardiovascular co-morbidities. Discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical \n\nadverse event occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with Rasitrio versus 2.4% in aliskiren/amlodipine, \n\n0.7% in aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.7% in amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other medicinal products that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with \n\naliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions \n\nwere found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive medicinal products. The clinical \n\nimplications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \n\nethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n\n75 years or older. \n\n \n\nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to other \n\nclasses of antihypertensive medicinal products including selected ACEI and ARB. Compared to a \n\ndiuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ), aliskiren 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n\n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n80 \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \n\ntolerated. Aliskiren induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12-week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn an 8-week study in 754 hypertensive geriatric patients aged 65 years or older and geriatric patients \n\naged 75 years or older (30%) aliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically \n\nsignificant superior reduction in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to \n\nplacebo. No additional blood pressure lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared \n\nto 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive medicinal products. With cessation of \n\ntreatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, \n\nwith no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nStudy results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.11 in favour of placebo (95% \n\nConfidence Interval: 1.00, 1.23, 2-sided p=0.05). In addition, an increased incidence of adverse events \n\nwas observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (37.9% versus 30.2%). In particular there was an \n\nincreased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.0% versus 12.1%), hyperkalaemia (38.9% versus \n\n28.8%), hypotension-related events (19.7% versus 16.2%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints (3.4% \n\nversus 2.6%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n81 \n\nEffects of aliskiren on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nNo long-term efficacy data for aliskiren in patients with heart failure are currently available (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Rasitrio inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac \n\nand vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \n\ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance \n\nand in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and \n\nnon-dihydropyridine binding sites. \n\n \n\nThe contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the \n\nmovement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilatation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in \n\nblood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine \n\nlevels with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, \n\nvasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with heart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n82 \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% vs. 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was no \n\nsignificant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRasitrio in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nFollowing oral administration of a fixed combination tablet of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, peak concentrations were achieved for aliskiren within 1-2 hours, for amlodipine \n\nwithin 8 hours and for hydrochlorothiazide within 2-3 hours. The rate and extent of absorption of \n\naliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide following administration of a fixed combination tablet \n\nare similar to when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\n \n\nThe results from a food effect study using a standard high-fat meal with the 300/10/25 mg fixed \n\ncombination tablet showed that food reduced the rate and extent of absorption of aliskiren in the fixed \n\ncombination tablet with a similar magnitude of effect as for aliskiren monotherapy. Food had no \n\neffect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide in the fixed combination tablet. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC 0-\n\ntau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with \n\nthe initial dose. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n83 \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \n\nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \n\nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, mean plasma clearance is \n\napproximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients (aged \n\n6-17 years) given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules \n\n(3.125 mg/tablet), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The available data did \n\nnot suggest that age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren systemic exposure \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated as between 64% \n\nand 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, with \n\n10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n\n30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 5 mg and 10 mg. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRasitrio is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nDue to its hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in patients with anuria or severe \n\nrenal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). No adjustment of the initial dose is \n\nrequired in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of aliskiren with \n\nARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs expected for a compound which is cleared almost exclusively via the kidneys, renal function has a \n\nmarked effect on the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide. In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak \n\nplasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is \n\nreduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide \n\nAUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n85 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting \n\nincrease in AUC of approximately 40-60%. Therefore caution should be exercised in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients \n\nNo data are available on systemic exposure after administration of Rasitrio in geriatric patients. When \n\nadministered alone, the AUC of aliskiren in geriatric subjects (>65 years) is 50% higher than in young \n\nsubjects. The time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and \n\nyounger subjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and \n\nelimination half-life in geriatric patients. Therefore particular caution is recommended when \n\nadministering Rasitrio to patients aged 65 years and over, and extreme caution in patients aged \n\n75 years or older (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. There are no specific data \n\nregarding the effect of hydrochlorothiazide in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rasitrio have not been investigated. A population pharmacokinetic study has \n\nbeen conducted in 74 hypertensive children aged from 1 to 17 years (with 34 patients aged 6 to \n\n12 years and 28 patients aged 13 to 17 years) receiving amlodipine between 1.25 and 20 mg given \n\neither once or twice daily. In children 6 to 12 years and in adolescents 13-17 years of age the typical \n\noral clearance (CL/F) was 22.5 and 27.4 l/hr respectively in males and 16.4 and 21.3 l/hr respectively \n\nin females. Large variability in exposure between individuals was observed. Data reported in children \n\nbelow 6 years are limited. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nNon-clinical studies of the toxicology of Rasitrio alone have not been conducted as these studies have \n\nbeen conducted for the individual components. \n\n \n\nThe toxicity profiles of the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nhave been well characterised in preclinical studies. Both combinations were generally well tolerated \n\nby rats. The findings from 2- and 13-week oral toxicity studies were consistent with those for the \n\nindividual components. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n86 \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nSafety data for amlodipine are well established both clinically and non-clinically. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no effects related to the medicinal product at either the gene or \n\nchromosome levels. \n\n \n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies \n\nwherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg,/day \n\nrespectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. These doses of hydrochlorothiazide in mice \n\nand rats represent 19 and 1.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n \n\nbasis. (Calculations assume an oral dose of 25 mg/day and a 60-kg patient.) \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n87 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRasitrio 300 mg/10 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate), 10 mg amlodipine (as besylate) \n\nand 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nLight red, ovaloid convex film-coated tablet with bevelled edges, with “UIU” debossed on one side \n\nand “NVR” on the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasitrio is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult \n\npatients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasitrio is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets given \n\nconcurrently at the same time of the day may be switched to a fixed combination tablet of Rasitrio \n\ncontaining the same component doses. \n\n \n\nThe fixed dose combination should only be used after a stable effect on the monocomponents, given \n\nconcurrently, has been established after dose titration. Dose should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly patients aged 65 years and over \n\nThere is evidence of an increased risk of adverse events related to hypotension in patients aged \n\n65 years or older treated with Rasitrio. Therefore, particular caution should be exercised when \n\nadministering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or over. \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in this group of patients is 150 mg. No clinically \n\nmeaningful additional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the \n\nmajority of elderly patients. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n90 \n\nElderly patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older (see \n\nsection 5.2). The use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older should be restricted to patients for \n\nwhom blood pressure control has been established for the free combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently without accompanying safety concerns, in particular \n\nhypotension. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is \n\nrecommended (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 89-60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n and 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n, \n\nrespectively) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated for use in patients with anuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). The concomitant use of Rasitrio with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) or \n\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment \n\n(GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen administering Rasitrio in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or patients with \n\nprogressive liver disease. No dosage recommendations have been established for amlodipine in \n\npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasitrio in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasitrio should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Rasitrio (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to \n\nother dihydropyridine derivatives, or to other sulphonamide-derived substances. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n Anuria. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n Hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, symptomatic hyperuricaemia and refractory hypokalaemia. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\n\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n91 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasitrio therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients \n\nwith ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial \n\ninfarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in \n\npatients with allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. Close monitoring of blood pressure, renal \n\nfunction and electrolytes should be exercised if co-administration is considered absolutely necessary. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 65 years and over \n\nParticular caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or older. \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. Patients aged \n\n65 years old or over, are more susceptible to hypotension-related adverse reactions following \n\ntreatment with Rasitrio (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited efficacy and safety data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or \n\nolder. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended (see \n\nsections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nNo data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are available for Rasitrio in patients with heart \n\nfailure (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n92 \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasitrio in the following \n\ncases: \n\n Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \n\ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \n\nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasitrio, or the treatment \n\nshould start under close medical supervision. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Rasitrio should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Rasitrio should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nHypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in \n\npatients with cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3, 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Rasitrio therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that Rasitrio would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \n\ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n93 \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Rasitrio is \n\nused in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. No data is available in hypertensive \n\npatients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \n\n≥177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in men and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension. Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) or \n\nanuria (see sections 4.2. and 4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \n\nrenal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the RAAS, caution should be exercised when Rasitrio is \n\ngiven in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver \n\ndisease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren \n\nin post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Rasitrio in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation, therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 \n\nand 5.2). Caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio to patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment or progressive liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe half life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \n\nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated when using amlodipine in patients suffering \n\nfrom aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dose adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic medicinal products may be required during Rasitrio therapy. Concomitant use of \n\nRasitrio with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n94 \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal products \n\nacting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, \n\nincluding acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. \n\nTherefore caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system (RAAS), angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the \n\nface, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal products that can cause angioedema, including \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasitrio should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Rasitrio, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is \n\nto discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may \n\nneed to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing \n\nacute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n95 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio interactions \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with hypertension did not indicate any clinically \n\nrelevant changes in the steady-state exposure (AUC) and Cmax of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide compared to the corresponding dual therapies. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels: The potassium-depleting effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal \n\nproducts associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \n\ncorticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocoricotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents affecting the \n\nRAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, \n\npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum \n\npotassium. If co-medication with an agent affecting the level of serum potassium is considered \n\nnecessary, caution is advisable. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not \n\nrecommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: Periodic monitoring of serum \n\npotassium is recommended when Rasitrio is administered with medicinal products affected by serum \n\npotassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs: As with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may \n\nalso weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the use of \n\nRasitrio with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nInformation on aliskiren interactions \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n- Dual RAAS blockade \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- P-glycoprotein (P-gp) potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \n\nCo-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is \n\nlikely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by \n\ngrapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, \n\ngrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasitrio. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- P-gp interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced \n\naliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s \n\nwort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has not been investigated for \n\naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp \n\ninhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may \n\nincrease tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will \n\nlikely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\n- Moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \n\nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-administration with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination \n\nof aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal \n\nimpairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- Furosemide and torasemide \n\nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see interaction with organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\n In patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n- Warfarin \n\nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\n- Food interactions \n\nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n\n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of aliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nInformation on amlodipine interactions \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on amlodipine \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \n\nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \n\nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n98 \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\n- Dantrolene (infusion) \n\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nEffects of amlodipine on other medicinal products \n\n- The blood pressure lowering effects of amlodipine add to the blood pressure lowering effects of \n\nother antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in \n\na 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to \n\nlimit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, \n\ndigoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nInformation on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nNot recommended \n\n- Lithium \n\nRenal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may be \n\nincreased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- Alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics \nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances that also have a blood pressure \n\nlowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system activity or direct vasodilatation) \n\nmay potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\n- Amantadine \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions caused by \n\namantadine. \n\n \n\n- Antidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be \n\nnecessary (see section 4.4). Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk of lactic \n\nacidosis induced by possible functional renal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n99 \n\n- Anticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. \n\natropine, biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach \n\nemptying rate. Conversely, it is anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease \n\nthe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products used in the treatment of gout \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise \n\nthe level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-\n\nadministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when \n\nassociated with medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and \n\nClass III antiarrhythmics and some antipsychotics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum sodium level \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified by concomitant administration of medicinal \n\nproducts such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term \n\nadministration of these medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Beta blockers and diazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase \n\nthe risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the \n\nhyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\n- Ion exchange resins \n\nAbsorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. However, staggering the \n\ndosage of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n \n\n- Vitamin D and calcium salts \n\nAdministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with vitamin D or with calcium \n\nsalts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide type diuretics may lead to \n\nhypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or \n\nvitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. \n\n \n\n- Non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the action of skeletal muscle relaxants such as \n\ncurare derivatives. \n\n \n\n- Cytotoxic agents \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\n- Digoxine or digitalis glycosides \n\nThiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of digitalis-induced cardiac \n\narrhythmias (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n- Methyldopa \n\nThere have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n100 \n\n- Iodine contrasting agents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute renal failure, especially \n\nwith high doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before administration. \n\n \n\n- Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical \n\nsignificance of this effect is uncertain and not sufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\nHealthcare professionals prescribing Rasitrio should counsel women of childbearing potential about \n\nthe potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment \n\nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasitrio should not be used in women \n\nplanning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \n\nsystem have been associated with serious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any \n\nmedicinal product that acts directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, aliskiren should not \n\nbe used during the first trimester of pregnancy and is contraindicated during the second and third \n\ntrimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. Reproductive studies in rats \n\nhave shown no toxicity except for delayed date of delivery and prolonged duration of labour at \n\ndosages 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans (see section 5.3). Use \n\nin pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself \n\ncarries greater risk for the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nRasitrio should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasitrio is contraindicated during \n\nthe second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasitrio should be discontinued accordingly as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was \n\nsecreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n101 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Rasitrio during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Rasitrio is used during breast-\n\nfeeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility with the use of Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\nThe fertility of rats was unaffected at doses of up to aliskiren 250 mg/kg/day and hydrochlorothiazide \n\n4 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \n\nwhen driving vehicles or using machines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may \n\noccasionally occur when taking Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \n\ntaking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, drowsiness, headache, fatigue or nausea, the ability to react \n\nmay be impaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nThe safety profile of Rasitrio presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Rasitrio and \n\nthe known safety profile of the individual components aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nSafety information for Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions observed with Rasitrio are hypotension and dizziness. The \n\nadverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components of Rasitrio (aliskiren, \n\namlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide) and listed in the respective paragraphs on the individual \n\ncomponents may occur with Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse reactions for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide are ranked under heading of \n\nfrequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Common Hypotension \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common Peripheral oedema \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n102 \n\nPeripheral oedema is a known, dose-dependent adverse reaction of amlodipine and has also been \n\nreported with aliskiren therapy in post-marketing experience. The incidence of peripheral oedema for \n\nRasitrio in a short-term double active-controlled study was 7.1% compared to 8.0% for \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, 4.1% for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.0% for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of any adverse reactions potentially related to hypotension in a short-term active \n\ncontrolled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to 3.7% with dual combinations. In patients \n\n≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up to 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\nOther adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with \n\nRasitrio even if not observed in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nSerious adverse reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which have been reported in \n\npost-marketing experience and may occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). The most \n\ncommon adverse reaction is diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe known aliskiren adverse reactions are presented in the table below using the same convention as \n\ndescribed previously for the fixed combination. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare Anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\n Uncommon Palpitations, oedema peripheral \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon Hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Uncommon Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common Diarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Not known Liver disorder*, jaundice, hepatitis, liver failure** \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens \n\nJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), oral mucosal \n\nreactions, rash, pruritus, urticaria \n\n Rare Angioedema, erythema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Uncommon Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nInvestigations \n\n Common Hyperkalaemia \n\n Uncommon Liver enzyme increased \n\n Rare Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased, blood creatinine \n\nincreased \n\n*Isolated cases of liver disorder with clinical symptoms and laboratory evidence of more marked \n\nhepatic dysfunction. \n\n**Including one case of ‘liver failure fulminant’ reported in the post-marketing experience, for which \n\na causal relationship with aliskiren cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n103 \n\nDescription of selected adverse events: \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have occurred during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing, or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations: In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory \n\nparameters were uncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in \n\nhypertensive patients, aliskiren had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density \n\nlipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other medicinal products acting on \n\nthe RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n<60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: Based on the limited amount of safety data available from a pharmacokinetic \n\nstudy of aliskiren treatment in 39 hypertensive children 6-17 years of age, the frequency, type and \n\nseverity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar to that seen in hypertensive adults. \n\nAs for other RAAS blockers, headache is a common adverse event in children treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n104 \n\nAmlodipine \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nVery rare Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nVery rare Allergic reactions \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery rare Hyperglycaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nUncommon Insomnia, mood changes (including anxiety), depression \n\nRare Confusion \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Somnolence, headache (especially at the beginning of treatment) \n\nUncommon Tremor, dysgeusia, syncope, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia \n\nVery rare Hypertonia, peripheral neuropathy \n\nEye disorders \n\nUncommon Visual disturbance (including diplopia) \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nUncommon Tinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon Palpitations \n\nVery rare Myocardial infarction, arrhythmia (including bradycardia, \n\nventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon Flushing \n\nVery rare Vasculitis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Dyspnoea, rhinitis \n\nVery rare Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Abdominal pain, nausea \n\nUncommon Vomiting, dyspepsia, altered bowel habits (including diarrhoea and \n\nconstipation), dry mouth \n\nVery rare Pancreatitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nVery rare Hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic enzymes increased (mostly consistent \n\nwith cholestasis) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Alopecia, purpura, skin decolouration, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, rash, \n\nexanthema \n\nVery rare Angioedema, erythema multiforme, urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome, Quincke oedema, photosensitivity \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Ankle swelling \n\nUncommon Arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, back pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nUncommon Micturition disorder, nocturia, increased urinary frequency \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nUncommon Impotence, gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Oedema, fatigue \n\nUncommon Chest pain, asthenia, pain, malaise \n\nInvestigations \n\nUncommon Weight increase, weight decrease \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\nExceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Rasitrio.

Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension \n\nup to and including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur with Rasitrio, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdose calls for active cardiovascular support \n\nincluding frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities and \n\nattention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \n\n \n\nA vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is \n\nno contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the \n\neffects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to \n\n2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of \n\namlodipine. \n\n \n\nSince amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (<2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n107 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, renin-inhibitors; ATC \n\ncode C09XA54 \n\n \n\nRasitrio combines three antihypertensive active substances with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: aliskiren belongs to the direct renin \n\ninhibitor class, amlodipine to the calcium channel blocker class and hydrochlorothiazide to the \n\nthiazide diuretics class. When combined, the consolidated effects of inhibition of the renin-\n\nangiotensin-aldosterone system, calcium channel-mediated vasodilatation and sodium chloride \n\nexcretion result in a reduction of blood pressure to a greater degree than the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Rasitrio provided clinically meaningful \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The greater blood pressure reduction for Rasitrio over each dual combination was seen \n\nat every hour including the early morning hours with the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure \n\nmonitoring. \n\n \n\nRasitrio was studied in a double-blind, randomised, active-controlled study in 1,181 patients of which \n\n773 were classified as moderately hypertensive (msSBP 160-180 mmHg) and 408 as severely \n\nhypertensive (msSBP >180 mmHg) at baseline. A large number of patients were obese (49%) and \n\nover 14% of the total population had diabetes. During the first 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, \n\npatients received triple combination aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 150/5/12.5 mg \n\n(N=308), or dual combinations of aliskiren/HCTZ 150/12.5 mg (N=295), aliskiren/amlodipine \n\n150/5 mg (N=282) and amlodipine/HCTZ 5/12.5 mg (N=295). Patients were force-titrated to higher \n\ndoses after 4 weeks for an additional 4 weeks of double-blind treatment to aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n300/10/25 mg, aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg, aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg and amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n10/25 mg. \n\n \n\nIn this study, Rasitrio at a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced statistically significant mean blood \n\npressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from baseline of 37.9/20.6 mmHg compared to \n\n31.4/18.0 mmHg with aliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 28.0/14.3 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 30.8/17.0 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. In patients with severe hypertension \n\n(SBP ≥180 mmHg), the reduction in blood pressure from baseline for Rasitrio and the dual \n\ncombinations respectively was 49.5/22.5 mmHg compared to 38.1/17.6 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 33.2/14.3 mmHg with aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/25 mg) and 39.9/17.8 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (10/25 mg). In a subset of \n\n588 patients in which patients >65 years were scarcely represented and those aged >75 years were \n\nvery scarcely represented, the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/10/25 mg) produced a systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure reduction of 39.7/21.1 mmHg from \n\nbaseline, compared to 31.3/18.74 mmHg for aliskiren/amlodipine (300/10 mg), 25.5/12.5 mmHg for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 29.2/16.4 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, defined as a difference between \n\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) readings ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). The effect of Rasitrio was \n\nobserved as early as one week after initiation of therapy. The blood-pressure-lowering effect in \n\npatients with moderate to severe hypertension was independent of age, gender, race, body mass index \n\nand overweight-associated disorders (metabolic syndrome and diabetes). \n\n \n\nRasitrio was associated with a significant reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA) (-34%) from \n\nbaseline while the dual combination of amlodipine with hydrochlorothiazide increased PRA (+170%). \n\nThe clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\nIn a 28 to 54 week open label safety study, efficacy was measured as secondary endpoint and Rasitrio \n\nat a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced mean blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) of \n\n37.3/21.8 mmHg over 28 to 54 weeks of treatment. Efficacy of Rasitrio was maintained over one year \n\nof treatment, with no evidence of loss of effect. \n\n \n\nIn a randomised, double blind, active controlled, 36-week study in elderly patients whose blood \n\npressure was not controlled with aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg (SBP ≥140 mmHg), clinically \n\nmeaningful further BP reduction was seen at week 36 endpoint for patients who received Rasitrio at a \n\ndose of 300/10/25 mg (from reductions in msSBP/msDBP of 15.0/8.6 mmHg at week 22 to reductions \n\nof 30.8/14.1 mmHg at week 36 endpoint). \n\n \n\nRasitrio has been administered to more than 1,155 patients in completed clinical trials, including \n\n182 patients for one year or more. Treatment with Rasitrio was well tolerated at doses up to \n\n300 mg/10 mg/25 mg with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations, except for symptomatic hypotension. The incidence of any adverse reactions \n\npotentially related to hypotension in a short-term controlled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to \n\n3.7% with dual combinations. In patients ≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up \n\nto 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of adverse events did not show any association with gender, age (with the exception of \n\nsymptomatic hypotension), body mass index, race or ethnicity. Adverse events have generally been \n\nmild and transient in nature. Very limited safety data are available for patients aged >75 years or \n\npatients with major cardiovascular co-morbidities. Discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical \n\nadverse event occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with Rasitrio versus 2.4% in aliskiren/amlodipine, \n\n0.7% in aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.7% in amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other medicinal products that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with \n\naliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions \n\nwere found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive medicinal products. The clinical \n\nimplications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \n\nethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n\n75 years or older. \n\n \n\nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to other \n\nclasses of antihypertensive medicinal products including selected ACEI and ARB. Compared to a \n\ndiuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ), aliskiren 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n\n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n109 \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \n\ntolerated. Aliskiren induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12-week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn an 8-week study in 754 hypertensive geriatric patients aged 65 years or older and geriatric patients \n\naged 75 years or older (30%) aliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically \n\nsignificant superior reduction in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to \n\nplacebo. No additional blood pressure lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared \n\nto 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive medicinal products. With cessation of \n\ntreatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, \n\nwith no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nStudy results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.11 in favour of placebo (95% \n\nConfidence Interval: 1.00, 1.23, 2-sided p=0.05). In addition, an increased incidence of adverse events \n\nwas observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (37.9% versus 30.2%). In particular there was an \n\nincreased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.0% versus 12.1%), hyperkalaemia (38.9% versus \n\n28.8%), hypotension-related events (19.7% versus 16.2%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints (3.4% \n\nversus 2.6%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nEffects of aliskiren on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\nNo long-term efficacy data for aliskiren in patients with heart failure are currently available (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Rasitrio inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac \n\nand vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \n\ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance \n\nand in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and \n\nnon-dihydropyridine binding sites. \n\n \n\nThe contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the \n\nmovement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilatation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in \n\nblood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine \n\nlevels with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, \n\nvasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with heart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n111 \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% vs. 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was no \n\nsignificant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRasitrio in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nFollowing oral administration of a fixed combination tablet of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, peak concentrations were achieved for aliskiren within 1-2 hours, for amlodipine \n\nwithin 8 hours and for hydrochlorothiazide within 2-3 hours. The rate and extent of absorption of \n\naliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide following administration of a fixed combination tablet \n\nare similar to when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\n \n\nThe results from a food effect study using a standard high-fat meal with the 300/10/25 mg fixed \n\ncombination tablet showed that food reduced the rate and extent of absorption of aliskiren in the fixed \n\ncombination tablet with a similar magnitude of effect as for aliskiren monotherapy. Food had no \n\neffect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide in the fixed combination tablet. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC 0-\n\ntau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with \n\nthe initial dose. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n112 \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \n\nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \n\nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, mean plasma clearance is \n\napproximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients (aged \n\n6-17 years) given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules \n\n(3.125 mg/tablet), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The available data did \n\nnot suggest that age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren systemic exposure \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated as between 64% \n\nand 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, with \n\n10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n\n30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 5 mg and 10 mg. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n113 \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRasitrio is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nDue to its hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in patients with anuria or severe \n\nrenal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). No adjustment of the initial dose is \n\nrequired in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of aliskiren with \n\nARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs expected for a compound which is cleared almost exclusively via the kidneys, renal function has a \n\nmarked effect on the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide. In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak \n\nplasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is \n\nreduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide \n\nAUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n114 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting \n\nincrease in AUC of approximately 40-60%. Therefore caution should be exercised in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients \n\nNo data are available on systemic exposure after administration of Rasitrio in geriatric patients. When \n\nadministered alone, the AUC of aliskiren in geriatric subjects (>65 years) is 50% higher than in young \n\nsubjects. The time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and \n\nyounger subjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and \n\nelimination half-life in geriatric patients. Therefore particular caution is recommended when \n\nadministering Rasitrio to patients aged 65 years and over, and extreme caution in patients aged \n\n75 years or older (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. There are no specific data \n\nregarding the effect of hydrochlorothiazide in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rasitrio have not been investigated. A population pharmacokinetic study has \n\nbeen conducted in 74 hypertensive children aged from 1 to 17 years (with 34 patients aged 6 to \n\n12 years and 28 patients aged 13 to 17 years) receiving amlodipine between 1.25 and 20 mg given \n\neither once or twice daily. In children 6 to 12 years and in adolescents 13-17 years of age the typical \n\noral clearance (CL/F) was 22.5 and 27.4 l/hr respectively in males and 16.4 and 21.3 l/hr respectively \n\nin females. Large variability in exposure between individuals was observed. Data reported in children \n\nbelow 6 years are limited. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nNon-clinical studies of the toxicology of Rasitrio alone have not been conducted as these studies have \n\nbeen conducted for the individual components. \n\n \n\nThe toxicity profiles of the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nhave been well characterised in preclinical studies. Both combinations were generally well tolerated \n\nby rats. The findings from 2- and 13-week oral toxicity studies were consistent with those for the \n\nindividual components. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n115 \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nSafety data for amlodipine are well established both clinically and non-clinically. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no effects related to the medicinal product at either the gene or \n\nchromosome levels. \n\n \n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies \n\nwherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg,/day \n\nrespectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. These doses of hydrochlorothiazide in mice \n\nand rats represent 19 and 1.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n \n\nbasis.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nBrown, ovaloid convex film-coated tablet with bevelled edges, with “VIV” debossed on one side and \n\n“NVR” on the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasitrio is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension as substitution therapy in adult \n\npatients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled on the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasitrio is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets given \n\nconcurrently at the same time of the day may be switched to a fixed combination tablet of Rasitrio \n\ncontaining the same component doses. \n\n \n\nThe fixed dose combination should only be used after a stable effect on the monocomponents, given \n\nconcurrently, has been established after dose titration. Dose should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly patients aged 65 years and over \n\nThere is evidence of an increased risk of adverse events related to hypotension in patients aged \n\n65 years or older treated with Rasitrio. Therefore, particular caution should be exercised when \n\nadministering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or over. \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in this group of patients is 150 mg. No clinically \n\nmeaningful additional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the \n\nmajority of elderly patients. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n119 \n\nElderly patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older (see \n\nsection 5.2). The use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or older should be restricted to patients for \n\nwhom blood pressure control has been established for the free combination of aliskiren, amlodipine \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concurrently without accompanying safety concerns, in particular \n\nhypotension. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is \n\nrecommended (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 89-60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n and 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n, \n\nrespectively) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated for use in patients with anuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). The concomitant use of Rasitrio with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) or \n\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment \n\n(GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen administering Rasitrio in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or patients with \n\nprogressive liver disease. No dosage recommendations have been established for amlodipine in \n\npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasitrio in children and adolescents below age 18 have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasitrio should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Rasitrio (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to \n\nother dihydropyridine derivatives, or to other sulphonamide-derived substances. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n Anuria. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n Hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, symptomatic hyperuricaemia and refractory hypokalaemia. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\n\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n120 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasitrio therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients \n\nwith ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial \n\ninfarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in \n\npatients with allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. Close monitoring of blood pressure, renal \n\nfunction and electrolytes should be exercised if co-administration is considered absolutely necessary. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 65 years and over \n\nParticular caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio in patients aged 65 years or older. \n\nSymptomatic hypotension occurred with higher frequency in patients with non-complicated \n\nhypertension treated with Rasitrio than in patients treated with dual combinations of \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. Patients aged \n\n65 years old or over, are more susceptible to hypotension-related adverse reactions following \n\ntreatment with Rasitrio (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients aged 75 years and over \n\nVery limited efficacy and safety data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years or \n\nolder. Extreme caution, including more frequent monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended (see \n\nsections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nNo data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are available for Rasitrio in patients with heart \n\nfailure (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n121 \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasitrio in the following \n\ncases: \n\n Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \n\ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \n\nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasitrio, or the treatment \n\nshould start under close medical supervision. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Rasitrio should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Rasitrio should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\n \n\nHypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in \n\npatients with cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3, 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Rasitrio therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that Rasitrio would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \n\ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n122 \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Rasitrio is \n\nused in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. No data is available in hypertensive \n\npatients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \n\n≥177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in men and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n\n<30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension. Rasitrio is \n\ncontraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) or \n\nanuria (see sections 4.2. and 4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate \n\nrenal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the RAAS, caution should be exercised when Rasitrio is \n\ngiven in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver \n\ndisease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren \n\nin post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Rasitrio in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation, therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in hypertensive patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 \n\nand 5.2). Caution should be exercised when administering Rasitrio to patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment or progressive liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe half life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \n\nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated when using amlodipine in patients suffering \n\nfrom aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dose adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic medicinal products may be required during Rasitrio therapy. Concomitant use of \n\nRasitrio with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasitrio is contraindicated \n\nin patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-existing \n\nhypercalcaemia. Rasitrio should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during treatment. Serum \n\nlevels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. Marked \n\nhypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued \n\nbefore carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n123 \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasitrio in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal products \n\nacting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, \n\nincluding acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. \n\nTherefore caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system (RAAS), angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the \n\nface, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal products that can cause angioedema, including \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasitrio should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Rasitrio, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is \n\nto discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may \n\nneed to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing \n\nacute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n124 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio interactions \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with hypertension did not indicate any clinically \n\nrelevant changes in the steady-state exposure (AUC) and Cmax of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide compared to the corresponding dual therapies. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels: The potassium-depleting effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal \n\nproducts associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \n\ncorticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocoricotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents affecting the \n\nRAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, \n\npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum \n\npotassium. If co-medication with an agent affecting the level of serum potassium is considered \n\nnecessary, caution is advisable. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not \n\nrecommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: Periodic monitoring of serum \n\npotassium is recommended when Rasitrio is administered with medicinal products affected by serum \n\npotassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs: As with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may \n\nalso weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the use of \n\nRasitrio with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nInformation on aliskiren interactions \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n- Dual RAAS blockade \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- P-glycoprotein (P-gp) potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \n\nCo-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is \n\nlikely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by \n\ngrapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, \n\ngrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasitrio. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n125 \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- P-gp interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced \n\naliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s \n\nwort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has not been investigated for \n\naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp \n\ninhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may \n\nincrease tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will \n\nlikely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\n- Moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \n\nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-administration with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination \n\nof aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal \n\nimpairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n- Furosemide and torasemide \n\nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see interaction with organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n126 \n\n \n\n- Warfarin \n\nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\n- Food interactions \n\nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n\n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of aliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nInformation on amlodipine interactions \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on amlodipine \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole \n\nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to \n\nsignificant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n127 \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers \n\nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\n- Grapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\n- Dantrolene (infusion) \n\nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nEffects of amlodipine on other medicinal products \n\n- The blood pressure lowering effects of amlodipine add to the blood pressure lowering effects of \n\nother antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in \n\na 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to \n\nlimit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, \n\ndigoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nInformation on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nNot recommended \n\n- Lithium \n\nRenal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may be \n\nincreased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- Alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics \nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances that also have a blood pressure \n\nlowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system activity or direct vasodilatation) \n\nmay potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\n- Amantadine \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions caused by \n\namantadine. \n\n \n\n- Antidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents) \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be \n\nnecessary (see section 4.4). Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk of lactic \n\nacidosis induced by possible functional renal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n128 \n\n- Anticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. \n\natropine, biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach \n\nemptying rate. Conversely, it is anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease \n\nthe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products used in the treatment of gout \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise \n\nthe level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-\n\nadministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when \n\nassociated with medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and \n\nClass III antiarrhythmics and some antipsychotics. \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum sodium level \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified by concomitant administration of medicinal \n\nproducts such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term \n\nadministration of these medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Beta blockers and diazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase \n\nthe risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the \n\nhyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\n- Ion exchange resins \n\nAbsorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. However, staggering the \n\ndosage of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n \n\n- Vitamin D and calcium salts \n\nAdministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with vitamin D or with calcium \n\nsalts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide type diuretics may lead to \n\nhypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or \n\nvitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. \n\n \n\n- Non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the action of skeletal muscle relaxants such as \n\ncurare derivatives. \n\n \n\n- Cytotoxic agents \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\n- Digoxine or digitalis glycosides \n\nThiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favour the onset of digitalis-induced cardiac \n\narrhythmias (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n- Methyldopa \n\nThere have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n129 \n\n- Iodine contrasting agents \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute renal failure, especially \n\nwith high doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before administration. \n\n \n\n- Pressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical \n\nsignificance of this effect is uncertain and not sufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\nHealthcare professionals prescribing Rasitrio should counsel women of childbearing potential about \n\nthe potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment \n\nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasitrio should not be used in women \n\nplanning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \n\nsystem have been associated with serious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any \n\nmedicinal product that acts directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, aliskiren should not \n\nbe used during the first trimester of pregnancy and is contraindicated during the second and third \n\ntrimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. Reproductive studies in rats \n\nhave shown no toxicity except for delayed date of delivery and prolonged duration of labour at \n\ndosages 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans (see section 5.3). Use \n\nin pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself \n\ncarries greater risk for the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \n\ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance \n\nand thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nRasitrio should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasitrio is contraindicated during \n\nthe second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasitrio should be discontinued accordingly as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was \n\nsecreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n130 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Rasitrio during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Rasitrio is used during breast-\n\nfeeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility with the use of Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\nThe fertility of rats was unaffected at doses of up to aliskiren 250 mg/kg/day and hydrochlorothiazide \n\n4 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \n\nwhen driving vehicles or using machines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may \n\noccasionally occur when taking Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \n\ntaking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, drowsiness, headache, fatigue or nausea, the ability to react \n\nmay be impaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nThe safety profile of Rasitrio presented below is based on clinical studies performed with Rasitrio and \n\nthe known safety profile of the individual components aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. \n\nSafety information for Rasitrio in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions observed with Rasitrio are hypotension and dizziness. The \n\nadverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components of Rasitrio (aliskiren, \n\namlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide) and listed in the respective paragraphs on the individual \n\ncomponents may occur with Rasitrio. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse reactions for aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide are ranked under heading of \n\nfrequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasitrio \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Common Hypotension \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common Peripheral oedema \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n131 \n\nPeripheral oedema is a known, dose-dependent adverse reaction of amlodipine and has also been \n\nreported with aliskiren therapy in post-marketing experience. The incidence of peripheral oedema for \n\nRasitrio in a short-term double active-controlled study was 7.1% compared to 8.0% for \n\naliskiren/amlodipine, 4.1% for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.0% for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of any adverse reactions potentially related to hypotension in a short-term active \n\ncontrolled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to 3.7% with dual combinations. In patients \n\n≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up to 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\nOther adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with \n\nRasitrio even if not observed in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nSerious adverse reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which have been reported in \n\npost-marketing experience and may occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). The most \n\ncommon adverse reaction is diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe known aliskiren adverse reactions are presented in the table below using the same convention as \n\ndescribed previously for the fixed combination. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare Anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n Common Dizziness \n\n Uncommon Palpitations, oedema peripheral \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon Hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Uncommon Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common Diarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Not known Liver disorder*, jaundice, hepatitis, liver failure** \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens \n\nJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), oral mucosal \n\nreactions, rash, pruritus, urticaria \n\n Rare Angioedema, erythema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Uncommon Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nInvestigations \n\n Common Hyperkalaemia \n\n Uncommon Liver enzyme increased \n\n Rare Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased, blood creatinine \n\nincreased \n\n*Isolated cases of liver disorder with clinical symptoms and laboratory evidence of more marked \n\nhepatic dysfunction. \n\n**Including one case of ‘liver failure fulminant’ reported in the post-marketing experience, for which \n\na causal relationship with aliskiren cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n132 \n\nDescription of selected adverse events: \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have occurred during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing, or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations: In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory \n\nparameters were uncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in \n\nhypertensive patients, aliskiren had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density \n\nlipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other medicinal products acting on \n\nthe RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n<60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: Based on the limited amount of safety data available from a pharmacokinetic \n\nstudy of aliskiren treatment in 39 hypertensive children 6-17 years of age, the frequency, type and \n\nseverity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar to that seen in hypertensive adults. \n\nAs for other RAAS blockers, headache is a common adverse event in children treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n133 \n\nAmlodipine \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nVery rare Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nVery rare Allergic reactions \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery rare Hyperglycaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nUncommon Insomnia, mood changes (including anxiety), depression \n\nRare Confusion \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Somnolence, headache (especially at the beginning of treatment) \n\nUncommon Tremor, dysgeusia, syncope, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia \n\nVery rare Hypertonia, peripheral neuropathy \n\nEye disorders \n\nUncommon Visual disturbance (including diplopia) \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nUncommon Tinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon Palpitations \n\nVery rare Myocardial infarction, arrhythmia (including bradycardia, \n\nventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon Flushing \n\nVery rare Vasculitis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Dyspnoea, rhinitis \n\nVery rare Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Abdominal pain, nausea \n\nUncommon Vomiting, dyspepsia, altered bowel habits (including diarrhoea and \n\nconstipation), dry mouth \n\nVery rare Pancreatitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nVery rare Hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic enzymes increased (mostly consistent \n\nwith cholestasis) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Alopecia, purpura, skin decolouration, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, rash, \n\nexanthema \n\nVery rare Angioedema, erythema multiforme, urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis, \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome, Quincke oedema, photosensitivity \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Ankle swelling \n\nUncommon Arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, back pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nUncommon Micturition disorder, nocturia, increased urinary frequency \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nUncommon Impotence, gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Oedema, fatigue \n\nUncommon Chest pain, asthenia, pain, malaise \n\nInvestigations \n\nUncommon Weight increase, weight decrease \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nExceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Rasitrio.

Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension \n\nup to and including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur with Rasitrio, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdose calls for active cardiovascular support \n\nincluding frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities and \n\nattention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \n\n \n\nA vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is \n\nno contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the \n\neffects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to \n\n2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of \n\namlodipine. \n\n \n\nSince amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (<2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n136 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, renin-inhibitors; ATC \n\ncode C09XA54 \n\n \n\nRasitrio combines three antihypertensive active substances with complementary mechanisms to \n\ncontrol blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: aliskiren belongs to the direct renin \n\ninhibitor class, amlodipine to the calcium channel blocker class and hydrochlorothiazide to the \n\nthiazide diuretics class. When combined, the consolidated effects of inhibition of the renin-\n\nangiotensin-aldosterone system, calcium channel-mediated vasodilatation and sodium chloride \n\nexcretion result in a reduction of blood pressure to a greater degree than the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Rasitrio provided clinically meaningful \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The greater blood pressure reduction for Rasitrio over each dual combination was seen \n\nat every hour including the early morning hours with the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure \n\nmonitoring. \n\n \n\nRasitrio was studied in a double-blind, randomised, active-controlled study in 1,181 patients of which \n\n773 were classified as moderately hypertensive (msSBP 160-180 mmHg) and 408 as severely \n\nhypertensive (msSBP >180 mmHg) at baseline. A large number of patients were obese (49%) and \n\nover 14% of the total population had diabetes. During the first 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, \n\npatients received triple combination aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 150/5/12.5 mg \n\n(N=308), or dual combinations of aliskiren/HCTZ 150/12.5 mg (N=295), aliskiren/amlodipine \n\n150/5 mg (N=282) and amlodipine/HCTZ 5/12.5 mg (N=295). Patients were force-titrated to higher \n\ndoses after 4 weeks for an additional 4 weeks of double-blind treatment to aliskiren/amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n300/10/25 mg, aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg, aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg and amlodipine/HCTZ \n\n10/25 mg. \n\n \n\nIn this study, Rasitrio at a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced statistically significant mean blood \n\npressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from baseline of 37.9/20.6 mmHg compared to \n\n31.4/18.0 mmHg with aliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 28.0/14.3 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 30.8/17.0 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. In patients with severe hypertension \n\n(SBP ≥180 mmHg), the reduction in blood pressure from baseline for Rasitrio and the dual \n\ncombinations respectively was 49.5/22.5 mmHg compared to 38.1/17.6 mmHg with \n\naliskiren/amlodipine combination (300/10 mg), 33.2/14.3 mmHg with aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/25 mg) and 39.9/17.8 mmHg with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (10/25 mg). In a subset of \n\n588 patients in which patients >65 years were scarcely represented and those aged >75 years were \n\nvery scarcely represented, the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(300/10/25 mg) produced a systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure reduction of 39.7/21.1 mmHg from \n\nbaseline, compared to 31.3/18.74 mmHg for aliskiren/amlodipine (300/10 mg), 25.5/12.5 mmHg for \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (300/25 mg) and 29.2/16.4 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n(10/25 mg) (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, defined as a difference between \n\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) readings ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). The effect of Rasitrio was \n\nobserved as early as one week after initiation of therapy. The blood-pressure-lowering effect in \n\npatients with moderate to severe hypertension was independent of age, gender, race, body mass index \n\nand overweight-associated disorders (metabolic syndrome and diabetes). \n\n \n\nRasitrio was associated with a significant reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA) (-34%) from \n\nbaseline while the dual combination of amlodipine with hydrochlorothiazide increased PRA (+170%). \n\nThe clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\nIn a 28 to 54 week open label safety study, efficacy was measured as secondary endpoint and Rasitrio \n\nat a dose of 300/10/25 mg produced mean blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) of \n\n37.3/21.8 mmHg over 28 to 54 weeks of treatment. Efficacy of Rasitrio was maintained over one year \n\nof treatment, with no evidence of loss of effect. \n\n \n\nIn a randomised, double blind, active controlled, 36-week study in elderly patients whose blood \n\npressure was not controlled with aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg (SBP ≥140 mmHg), clinically \n\nmeaningful further BP reduction was seen at week 36 endpoint for patients who received Rasitrio at a \n\ndose of 300/10/25 mg (from reductions in msSBP/msDBP of 15.0/8.6 mmHg at week 22 to reductions \n\nof 30.8/14.1 mmHg at week 36 endpoint). \n\n \n\nRasitrio has been administered to more than 1,155 patients in completed clinical trials, including \n\n182 patients for one year or more. Treatment with Rasitrio was well tolerated at doses up to \n\n300 mg/10 mg/25 mg with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to the corresponding dual \n\ncombinations, except for symptomatic hypotension. The incidence of any adverse reactions \n\npotentially related to hypotension in a short-term controlled study was 4.9% with Rasitrio versus up to \n\n3.7% with dual combinations. In patients ≥65 years the incidence was 10.2% with Rasitrio versus up \n\nto 5.4% with dual combinations. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of adverse events did not show any association with gender, age (with the exception of \n\nsymptomatic hypotension), body mass index, race or ethnicity. Adverse events have generally been \n\nmild and transient in nature. Very limited safety data are available for patients aged >75 years or \n\npatients with major cardiovascular co-morbidities. Discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical \n\nadverse event occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with Rasitrio versus 2.4% in aliskiren/amlodipine, \n\n0.7% in aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and 2.7% in amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other medicinal products that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with \n\naliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions \n\nwere found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive medicinal products. The clinical \n\nimplications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \n\nethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n\n75 years or older. \n\n \n\nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to other \n\nclasses of antihypertensive medicinal products including selected ACEI and ARB. Compared to a \n\ndiuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ), aliskiren 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n\n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n138 \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \n\ntolerated. Aliskiren induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12-week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn an 8-week study in 754 hypertensive geriatric patients aged 65 years or older and geriatric patients \n\naged 75 years or older (30%) aliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically \n\nsignificant superior reduction in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to \n\nplacebo. No additional blood pressure lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared \n\nto 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive medicinal products. With cessation of \n\ntreatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, \n\nwith no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nStudy results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.11 in favour of placebo (95% \n\nConfidence Interval: 1.00, 1.23, 2-sided p=0.05). In addition, an increased incidence of adverse events \n\nwas observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (37.9% versus 30.2%). In particular there was an \n\nincreased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.0% versus 12.1%), hyperkalaemia (38.9% versus \n\n28.8%), hypotension-related events (19.7% versus 16.2%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints (3.4% \n\nversus 2.6%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nEffects of aliskiren on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\nNo long-term efficacy data for aliskiren in patients with heart failure are currently available (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Rasitrio inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac \n\nand vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \n\ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance \n\nand in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and \n\nnon-dihydropyridine binding sites. \n\n \n\nThe contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the \n\nmovement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilatation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in \n\nblood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine \n\nlevels with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, \n\nvasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with heart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n140 \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% vs. 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was no \n\nsignificant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, \n\nthereby affecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride \n\nexcretion to an approximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma \n\nvolume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary \n\npotassium loss, and a decrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRasitrio in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nFollowing oral administration of a fixed combination tablet of aliskiren, amlodipine and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, peak concentrations were achieved for aliskiren within 1-2 hours, for amlodipine \n\nwithin 8 hours and for hydrochlorothiazide within 2-3 hours. The rate and extent of absorption of \n\naliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide following administration of a fixed combination tablet \n\nare similar to when administered as individual dosage forms. \n\n \n\nThe results from a food effect study using a standard high-fat meal with the 300/10/25 mg fixed \n\ncombination tablet showed that food reduced the rate and extent of absorption of aliskiren in the fixed \n\ncombination tablet with a similar magnitude of effect as for aliskiren monotherapy. Food had no \n\neffect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide in the fixed combination tablet. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC 0-\n\ntau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with \n\nthe initial dose. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n141 \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \n\nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \n\nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, mean plasma clearance is \n\napproximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients (aged \n\n6-17 years) given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules \n\n(3.125 mg/tablet), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The available data did \n\nnot suggest that age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren systemic exposure \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated as between 64% \n\nand 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, with \n\n10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately \n\n30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 5 mg and 10 mg. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n142 \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nThe increase in mean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRasitrio is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nDue to its hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasitrio is contraindicated in patients with anuria or severe \n\nrenal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). No adjustment of the initial dose is \n\nrequired in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of aliskiren with \n\nARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. \n\n \n\nAs expected for a compound which is cleared almost exclusively via the kidneys, renal function has a \n\nmarked effect on the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide. In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak \n\nplasma levels and AUC values of hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is \n\nreduced. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide \n\nAUC has been observed. In patients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n143 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasitrio is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting \n\nincrease in AUC of approximately 40-60%. Therefore caution should be exercised in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nGeriatric patients \n\nNo data are available on systemic exposure after administration of Rasitrio in geriatric patients. When \n\nadministered alone, the AUC of aliskiren in geriatric subjects (>65 years) is 50% higher than in young \n\nsubjects. The time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and \n\nyounger subjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and \n\nelimination half-life in geriatric patients. Therefore particular caution is recommended when \n\nadministering Rasitrio to patients aged 65 years and over, and extreme caution in patients aged \n\n75 years or older (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nLimited data suggest that the systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and \n\nhypertensive elderly subjects compared to young healthy volunteers. There are no specific data \n\nregarding the effect of hydrochlorothiazide in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rasitrio have not been investigated. A population pharmacokinetic study has \n\nbeen conducted in 74 hypertensive children aged from 1 to 17 years (with 34 patients aged 6 to \n\n12 years and 28 patients aged 13 to 17 years) receiving amlodipine between 1.25 and 20 mg given \n\neither once or twice daily. In children 6 to 12 years and in adolescents 13-17 years of age the typical \n\noral clearance (CL/F) was 22.5 and 27.4 l/hr respectively in males and 16.4 and 21.3 l/hr respectively \n\nin females. Large variability in exposure between individuals was observed. Data reported in children \n\nbelow 6 years are limited. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nNon-clinical studies of the toxicology of Rasitrio alone have not been conducted as these studies have \n\nbeen conducted for the individual components. \n\n \n\nThe toxicity profiles of the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide and aliskiren/amlodipine \n\nhave been well characterised in preclinical studies. Both combinations were generally well tolerated \n\nby rats. The findings from 2- and 13-week oral toxicity studies were consistent with those for the \n\nindividual components. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n144 \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nSafety data for amlodipine are well established both clinically and non-clinically. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of \n\n10 mg on a mg/m\n2\n basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no effects related to the medicinal product at either the gene or \n\nchromosome levels. \n\n \n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies \n\nwherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg,/day \n\nrespectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. These doses of hydrochlorothiazide in mice \n\nand rats represent 19 and 1.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\n2\n \n\nbasis. (Calculations assume an oral dose of 25 mg/day and a 60-kg patient.) \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n145 \n\n6.

What Rasitrio is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Rasitrio is \n\nRasitrio contains three active substances, called aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. All of \n\nthese substances help to control high blood pressure (hypertension). \n\n \n\n Aliskiren is a substance that belongs to a group of medicines called renin inhibitors. These \n\nreduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can make. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to \n\ntighten, which raises blood pressure. Lowering the amount of angiotensin II allows the blood \n\nvessels to relax; this lowers blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines known as calcium channel blockers, which help to \n\ncontrol high blood pressure. Amlodipine causes blood vessels to dilate and relax; this lowers \n\nblood pressure. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \n\nof developing these disorders. \n\n \n\nWhat Rasitrio is used for \n\nRasitrio is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who have their blood pressure already \n\ncontrolled by aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide taken as separate medicines given at the \n\nsame time. These patients may thus benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n193 \n\n2.

If you think you may be allergic, do not take Rasitrio and \n\nask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \n\nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren, \n\n- hereditary angioedema, \n\n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Rasitrio in early pregnancy – \n\nsee Pregnancy section). \n\n- if you have serious liver problems. \n\n- if you have serious kidney problems. \n\n- if you have problems to produce urine (anuria). \n\n- if the level of potassium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n\n- if the level of sodium in your blood is too low. \n\n- if the level of calcium in your blood is too high. \n\n- if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\n- if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other \n\nconditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), \n\n- itraconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections), \n\n- quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \n\nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you have a very low blood pressure. \n\n- if you are suffering from shock, including cardiogenic shock. \n\n- if you have a narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis). \n\n- if you have heart failure after an acute heart attack. \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Rasitrio and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasitrio: \n\n- if you are suffering from vomiting or diarrhoea or if you are taking a diuretic (a medicine to \n\nincrease the amount of urine you produce). \n\n- if you have already experienced angioedema (difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or \n\nswelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking \n\nRasitrio and contact your doctor. \n\n- if you suffer from heart problems. \n\n- if you are on a low-salt diet. \n\n- if your urine flow has decreased markedly for 24 hours or more and/or if you have serious \n\nkidney problems (e.g. require dialysis), including if you have had a kidney transplant or a \n\nnarrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to your kidney. \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether Rasitrio is \n\nsuitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you suffer from liver problems (impaired liver function). \n\n- if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n- if you have a high level of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n- if you suffer from a disease called lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n194 \n\n- if you suffer from allergy or asthma. \n\n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you are 65 years of age or older (see section Elderly (age 65 years or older) below). \n\n- if you have signs and symptoms such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, \n\ndrowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, weakness, low blood pressure, reduced urine \n\noutput, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an excessive \n\neffect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Rasitrio). \n\n- if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n- if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to weeks of taking Rasitrio. This can lead to \n\npermanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\n- if you have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n\n- if you have serious congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump \n\nenough blood around the body. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.

Your doctor will \n\ncarefully consider whether Rasitrio is suitable for you. If you are 75 years of age or older, your doctor \n\nmay wish to monitor your blood pressure more frequently. \n\n \n\nIn the majority of patients aged 65 years or older, the 300 mg dose of aliskiren shows no additional \n\nbenefit in reducing blood pressure compared to the 150 mg dose. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Rasitrio \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasitrio and talk to your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection and also in other \n\nconditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis). \n\n- itraconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections). \n\n- quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- one of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure if you have diabetes \n\nmellitus or impaired kidney function: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n195 \n\nTell your doctor if you are using the following medicines: \n\n- medicines or substances that increase the amount of potassium in your blood.

Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSide effects reported for Rasitrio are: \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n dizziness \n\n low blood pressure \n\n swelling of hands, ankles and feet (peripheral oedema). \n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you experience the following at the beginning of your treatment: \n\nFainting and/or light-headedness linked to low blood pressure could occur at the beginning of \n\ntreatment with Rasitrio. Patients 65 years of age or older are more susceptible to side effects related to \n\nlow blood pressure. In clinical trials low blood pressure occurred more frequently in patients taking \n\nRasitrio than those taking only dual combinations of aliskiren/amlodipine, \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (see section 2). \n\n \n\nThe following, possibly serious, side effects have been reported with medicines containing aliskiren, \n\namlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide alone. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nSome side effects can be serious (frequency not known): \n\nA few patients have experienced these serious side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people).

What Rasitrio is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Rasitrio is \n\nRasitrio contains three active substances, called aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. All of \n\nthese substances help to control high blood pressure (hypertension). \n\n \n\n Aliskiren is a substance that belongs to a group of medicines called renin inhibitors. These \n\nreduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can make. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to \n\ntighten, which raises blood pressure. Lowering the amount of angiotensin II allows the blood \n\nvessels to relax; this lowers blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines known as calcium channel blockers, which help to \n\ncontrol high blood pressure. Amlodipine causes blood vessels to dilate and relax; this lowers \n\nblood pressure. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \n\nof developing these disorders. \n\n \n\nWhat Rasitrio is used for \n\nRasitrio is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who have their blood pressure already \n\ncontrolled by aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide taken as separate medicines given at the \n\nsame time. These patients may thus benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n205 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rasitrio \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasitrio \n\n- if you are allergic to aliskiren, to amlodipine, to other dihydropyridine-derived medicines \n\n(known as calcium channel blockers), to hydrochlorothiazide, to sulphonamide-derived \n\nmedicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections) or to any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic, do not take Rasitrio and \n\nask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \n\nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren, \n\n- hereditary angioedema, \n\n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Rasitrio in early pregnancy – \n\nsee Pregnancy section). \n\n- if you have serious liver problems. \n\n- if you have serious kidney problems. \n\n- if you have problems to produce urine (anuria). \n\n- if the level of potassium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n\n- if the level of sodium in your blood is too low. \n\n- if the level of calcium in your blood is too high. \n\n- if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\n- if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other \n\nconditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), \n\n- itraconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections), \n\n- quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \n\nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you have a very low blood pressure. \n\n- if you are suffering from shock, including cardiogenic shock. \n\n- if you have a narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis). \n\n- if you have heart failure after an acute heart attack. \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Rasitrio and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasitrio: \n\n- if you are suffering from vomiting or diarrhoea or if you are taking a diuretic (a medicine to \n\nincrease the amount of urine you produce). \n\n- if you have already experienced angioedema (difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or \n\nswelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking \n\nRasitrio and contact your doctor. \n\n- if you suffer from heart problems. \n\n- if you are on a low-salt diet. \n\n- if your urine flow has decreased markedly for 24 hours or more and/or if you have serious \n\nkidney problems (e.g. require dialysis), including if you have had a kidney transplant or a \n\nnarrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to your kidney. \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether Rasitrio is \n\nsuitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you suffer from liver problems (impaired liver function). \n\n- if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n- if you have a high level of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n- if you suffer from a disease called lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n206 \n\n- if you suffer from allergy or asthma. \n\n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you are 65 years of age or older (see section Elderly (age 65 years or older) below). \n\n- if you have signs and symptoms such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, \n\ndrowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, weakness, low blood pressure, reduced urine \n\noutput, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an excessive \n\neffect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Rasitrio). \n\n- if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n- if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to weeks of taking Rasitrio. This can lead to \n\npermanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\n- if you have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n\n- if you have serious congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump \n\nenough blood around the body. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.

Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Rasitrio before you become \n\npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Rasitrio.

If you experience this symptom, do not drive or \n\nuse tools or machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Rasitrio \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you and do not exceed the recommended \n\ndose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Rasitrio is one tablet a day. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nSwallow the tablet whole with some water. You should take this medicine with a light meal once a \n\nday, preferably at the same time each day. You should not take this medicine together with grapefruit \n\njuice. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Rasitrio than you should \n\nIf you have accidentally taken too many Rasitrio tablets, talk to a doctor immediately. You may \n\nrequire medical attention. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Rasitrio \n\nIf you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next \n\ndose at its usual time. If it is almost time for your next dose you should simply take the next tablet at \n\nthe usual time. Do not take a double dose (two tablets at once) to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n209 \n\nDo not stop taking this medicine, even if you are feeling well (unless your doctor tells you to do so). \n\nPeople who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many may feel \n\nquite normal. It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get the \n\nbest results and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if you \n\nare feeling well. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

These \n\nreduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can make. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to \n\ntighten, which raises blood pressure. Lowering the amount of angiotensin II allows the blood \n\nvessels to relax; this lowers blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines known as calcium channel blockers, which help to \n\ncontrol high blood pressure. Amlodipine causes blood vessels to dilate and relax; this lowers \n\nblood pressure. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \n\nof developing these disorders. \n\n \n\nWhat Rasitrio is used for \n\nRasitrio is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who have their blood pressure already \n\ncontrolled by aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide taken as separate medicines given at the \n\nsame time. These patients may thus benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n217 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rasitrio \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasitrio \n\n- if you are allergic to aliskiren, to amlodipine, to other dihydropyridine-derived medicines \n\n(known as calcium channel blockers), to hydrochlorothiazide, to sulphonamide-derived \n\nmedicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections) or to any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic, do not take Rasitrio and \n\nask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \n\nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren, \n\n- hereditary angioedema, \n\n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Rasitrio in early pregnancy – \n\nsee Pregnancy section). \n\n- if you have serious liver problems. \n\n- if you have serious kidney problems. \n\n- if you have problems to produce urine (anuria). \n\n- if the level of potassium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n\n- if the level of sodium in your blood is too low. \n\n- if the level of calcium in your blood is too high. \n\n- if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\n- if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other \n\nconditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), \n\n- itraconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections), \n\n- quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \n\nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you have a very low blood pressure. \n\n- if you are suffering from shock, including cardiogenic shock. \n\n- if you have a narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis). \n\n- if you have heart failure after an acute heart attack. \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Rasitrio and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasitrio: \n\n- if you are suffering from vomiting or diarrhoea or if you are taking a diuretic (a medicine to \n\nincrease the amount of urine you produce). \n\n- if you have already experienced angioedema (difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or \n\nswelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking \n\nRasitrio and contact your doctor. \n\n- if you suffer from heart problems. \n\n- if you are on a low-salt diet. \n\n- if your urine flow has decreased markedly for 24 hours or more and/or if you have serious \n\nkidney problems (e.g. require dialysis), including if you have had a kidney transplant or a \n\nnarrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to your kidney. \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether Rasitrio is \n\nsuitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you suffer from liver problems (impaired liver function). \n\n- if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n- if you have a high level of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n- if you suffer from a disease called lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n218 \n\n- if you suffer from allergy or asthma. \n\n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you are 65 years of age or older (see section Elderly (age 65 years or older) below). \n\n- if you have signs and symptoms such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, \n\ndrowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, weakness, low blood pressure, reduced urine \n\noutput, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an excessive \n\neffect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Rasitrio). \n\n- if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n- if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to weeks of taking Rasitrio. This can lead to \n\npermanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\n- if you have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n\n- if you have serious congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump \n\nenough blood around the body. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Rasitrio is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \n\nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see Pregnancy section). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Rasitrio in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nYou should tell your doctor if you are 65 years of age or older because you may be more susceptible \n\nto side effects related to low blood pressure (see section 4 on possible side effects). Your doctor will \n\ncarefully consider whether Rasitrio is suitable for you. If you are 75 years of age or older, your doctor \n\nmay wish to monitor your blood pressure more frequently. \n\n \n\nIn the majority of patients aged 65 years or older, the 300 mg dose of aliskiren shows no additional \n\nbenefit in reducing blood pressure compared to the 150 mg dose. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Rasitrio \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasitrio and talk to your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection and also in other \n\nconditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis). \n\n- itraconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections). \n\n- quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- one of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure if you have diabetes \n\nmellitus or impaired kidney function: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n219 \n\nTell your doctor if you are using the following medicines: \n\n- medicines or substances that increase the amount of potassium in your blood.

What Rasitrio is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Rasitrio is \n\nRasitrio contains three active substances, called aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. All of \n\nthese substances help to control high blood pressure (hypertension). \n\n \n\n Aliskiren is a substance that belongs to a group of medicines called renin inhibitors. These \n\nreduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can make. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to \n\ntighten, which raises blood pressure. Lowering the amount of angiotensin II allows the blood \n\nvessels to relax; this lowers blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines known as calcium channel blockers, which help to \n\ncontrol high blood pressure. Amlodipine causes blood vessels to dilate and relax; this lowers \n\nblood pressure. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \n\nof developing these disorders. \n\n \n\nWhat Rasitrio is used for \n\nRasitrio is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who have their blood pressure already \n\ncontrolled by aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide taken as separate medicines given at the \n\nsame time. These patients may thus benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n229 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rasitrio \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasitrio \n\n- if you are allergic to aliskiren, to amlodipine, to other dihydropyridine-derived medicines \n\n(known as calcium channel blockers), to hydrochlorothiazide, to sulphonamide-derived \n\nmedicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections) or to any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic, do not take Rasitrio and \n\nask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \n\nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren, \n\n- hereditary angioedema, \n\n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Rasitrio in early pregnancy – \n\nsee Pregnancy section). \n\n- if you have serious liver problems. \n\n- if you have serious kidney problems. \n\n- if you have problems to produce urine (anuria). \n\n- if the level of potassium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n\n- if the level of sodium in your blood is too low. \n\n- if the level of calcium in your blood is too high. \n\n- if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\n- if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other \n\nconditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), \n\n- itraconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections), \n\n- quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \n\nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you have a very low blood pressure. \n\n- if you are suffering from shock, including cardiogenic shock. \n\n- if you have a narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis). \n\n- if you have heart failure after an acute heart attack. \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Rasitrio and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasitrio: \n\n- if you are suffering from vomiting or diarrhoea or if you are taking a diuretic (a medicine to \n\nincrease the amount of urine you produce). \n\n- if you have already experienced angioedema (difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or \n\nswelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking \n\nRasitrio and contact your doctor. \n\n- if you suffer from heart problems. \n\n- if you are on a low-salt diet. \n\n- if your urine flow has decreased markedly for 24 hours or more and/or if you have serious \n\nkidney problems (e.g. require dialysis), including if you have had a kidney transplant or a \n\nnarrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to your kidney. \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether Rasitrio is \n\nsuitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you suffer from liver problems (impaired liver function). \n\n- if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n- if you have a high level of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n- if you suffer from a disease called lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n230 \n\n- if you suffer from allergy or asthma. \n\n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you are 65 years of age or older (see section Elderly (age 65 years or older) below). \n\n- if you have signs and symptoms such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, \n\ndrowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, weakness, low blood pressure, reduced urine \n\noutput, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an excessive \n\neffect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Rasitrio). \n\n- if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n- if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to weeks of taking Rasitrio. This can lead to \n\npermanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\n- if you have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n\n- if you have serious congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump \n\nenough blood around the body. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Rasitrio is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \n\nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see Pregnancy section). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Rasitrio in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nYou should tell your doctor if you are 65 years of age or older because you may be more susceptible \n\nto side effects related to low blood pressure (see section 4 on possible side effects). Your doctor will \n\ncarefully consider whether Rasitrio is suitable for you. If you are 75 years of age or older, your doctor \n\nmay wish to monitor your blood pressure more frequently. \n\n \n\nIn the majority of patients aged 65 years or older, the 300 mg dose of aliskiren shows no additional \n\nbenefit in reducing blood pressure compared to the 150 mg dose. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Rasitrio \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasitrio and talk to your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection and also in other \n\nconditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis). \n\n- itraconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections). \n\n- quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- one of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure if you have diabetes \n\nmellitus or impaired kidney function: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n231 \n\nTell your doctor if you are using the following medicines: \n\n- medicines or substances that increase the amount of potassium in your blood.

If you think \n\nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before \n\ntaking this medicine. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Rasitrio before you become \n\npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Rasitrio. Rasitrio is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \n\ncause serious harm to your baby if it is used after the third month of pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Rasitrio is not \n\nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \n\nyou if you wish to breast-feed. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis medicine may make you feel dizzy and drowsy. If you experience this symptom, do not drive or \n\nuse tools or machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Rasitrio \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you and do not exceed the recommended \n\ndose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Rasitrio is one tablet a day. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nSwallow the tablet whole with some water. You should take this medicine with a light meal once a \n\nday, preferably at the same time each day. You should not take this medicine together with grapefruit \n\njuice. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Rasitrio than you should \n\nIf you have accidentally taken too many Rasitrio tablets, talk to a doctor immediately. You may \n\nrequire medical attention. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Rasitrio \n\nIf you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next \n\ndose at its usual time. If it is almost time for your next dose you should simply take the next tablet at \n\nthe usual time. Do not take a double dose (two tablets at once) to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n233 \n\nDo not stop taking this medicine, even if you are feeling well (unless your doctor tells you to do so). \n\nPeople who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many may feel \n\nquite normal. It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get the \n\nbest results and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if you \n\nare feeling well. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSide effects reported for Rasitrio are: \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n dizziness \n\n low blood pressure \n\n swelling of hands, ankles and feet (peripheral oedema). \n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you experience the following at the beginning of your treatment: \n\nFainting and/or light-headedness linked to low blood pressure could occur at the beginning of \n\ntreatment with Rasitrio.

What Rasitrio is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Rasitrio is \n\nRasitrio contains three active substances, called aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. All of \n\nthese substances help to control high blood pressure (hypertension). \n\n \n\n Aliskiren is a substance that belongs to a group of medicines called renin inhibitors. These \n\nreduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can make. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to \n\ntighten, which raises blood pressure. Lowering the amount of angiotensin II allows the blood \n\nvessels to relax; this lowers blood pressure. \n\n Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines known as calcium channel blockers, which help to \n\ncontrol high blood pressure. Amlodipine causes blood vessels to dilate and relax; this lowers \n\nblood pressure. \n\n Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics. \n\nHydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \n\nof developing these disorders. \n\n \n\nWhat Rasitrio is used for \n\nRasitrio is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients who have their blood pressure already \n\ncontrolled by aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide taken as separate medicines given at the \n\nsame time. These patients may thus benefit from taking one tablet containing all three substances. \n\n \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n241 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rasitrio \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasitrio \n\n- if you are allergic to aliskiren, to amlodipine, to other dihydropyridine-derived medicines \n\n(known as calcium channel blockers), to hydrochlorothiazide, to sulphonamide-derived \n\nmedicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections) or to any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you may be allergic, do not take Rasitrio and \n\nask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \n\nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren, \n\n- hereditary angioedema, \n\n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Rasitrio in early pregnancy – \n\nsee Pregnancy section). \n\n- if you have serious liver problems. \n\n- if you have serious kidney problems. \n\n- if you have problems to produce urine (anuria). \n\n- if the level of potassium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n\n- if the level of sodium in your blood is too low. \n\n- if the level of calcium in your blood is too high. \n\n- if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n\n- if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other \n\nconditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), \n\n- itraconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections), \n\n- quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \n\nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you have a very low blood pressure. \n\n- if you are suffering from shock, including cardiogenic shock. \n\n- if you have a narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis). \n\n- if you have heart failure after an acute heart attack. \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Rasitrio and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasitrio: \n\n- if you are suffering from vomiting or diarrhoea or if you are taking a diuretic (a medicine to \n\nincrease the amount of urine you produce). \n\n- if you have already experienced angioedema (difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or \n\nswelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking \n\nRasitrio and contact your doctor. \n\n- if you suffer from heart problems. \n\n- if you are on a low-salt diet. \n\n- if your urine flow has decreased markedly for 24 hours or more and/or if you have serious \n\nkidney problems (e.g. require dialysis), including if you have had a kidney transplant or a \n\nnarrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to your kidney. \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether Rasitrio is \n\nsuitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you suffer from liver problems (impaired liver function). \n\n- if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n\n- if you have a high level of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n\n- if you suffer from a disease called lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”). \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n242 \n\n- if you suffer from allergy or asthma. \n\n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin II receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you are 65 years of age or older (see section Elderly (age 65 years or older) below). \n\n- if you have signs and symptoms such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, \n\ndrowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, weakness, low blood pressure, reduced urine \n\noutput, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an excessive \n\neffect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Rasitrio). \n\n- if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n\n- if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to weeks of taking Rasitrio. This can lead to \n\npermanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\n- if you have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n\n- if you have serious congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump \n\nenough blood around the body. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Rasitrio is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \n\nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see Pregnancy section). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Rasitrio in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nYou should tell your doctor if you are 65 years of age or older because you may be more susceptible \n\nto side effects related to low blood pressure (see section 4 on possible side effects).

You \n\nshould not take this medicine with grapefruit juice. \n\n \n\nDue to hydrochlorothiazide contained in Rasitrio, if you drink alcohol while on treatment with this \n\nmedicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, especially when getting up \n\nfrom a sitting position. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant (see section Do not take Rasitrio). If you become \n\npregnant while taking this medicine stop taking it immediately and talk to your doctor. If you think \n\nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before \n\ntaking this medicine. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Rasitrio before you become \n\npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Rasitrio. Rasitrio is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \n\ncause serious harm to your baby if it is used after the third month of pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Rasitrio is not \n\nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \n\nyou if you wish to breast-feed. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis medicine may make you feel dizzy and drowsy. If you experience this symptom, do not drive or \n\nuse tools or machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Rasitrio \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you and do not exceed the recommended \n\ndose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Rasitrio is one tablet a day. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nSwallow the tablet whole with some water. You should take this medicine with a light meal once a \n\nday, preferably at the same time each day. You should not take this medicine together with grapefruit \n\njuice. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Rasitrio than you should \n\nIf you have accidentally taken too many Rasitrio tablets, talk to a doctor immediately. You may \n\nrequire medical attention. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Rasitrio \n\nIf you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next \n\ndose at its usual time. If it is almost time for your next dose you should simply take the next tablet at \n\nthe usual time. Do not take a double dose (two tablets at once) to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n\n \n\nLe\nge\n\nmi\ndle\n\nt e\nr ik\n\nke\n le\n\nng\ner \n\ngo\ndk\n\njen\nt fo\n\nr s\nalg\n\n\n\n245 \n\nDo not stop taking this medicine, even if you are feeling well (unless your doctor tells you to do so). \n\nPeople who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many may feel \n\nquite normal. It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get the \n\nbest results and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if you \n\nare feeling well. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

Patients 65 years of age or older are more susceptible to side effects related to \n\nlow blood pressure. In clinical trials low blood pressure occurred more frequently in patients taking \n\nRasitrio than those taking only dual combinations of aliskiren/amlodipine, \n\naliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (see section 2). \n\n \n\nThe following, possibly serious, side effects have been reported with medicines containing aliskiren, \n\namlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide alone. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nSome side effects can be serious (frequency not known): \n\nA few patients have experienced these serious side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people).
