This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRydapt 25 mg soft capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach soft capsule contains 25 mg midostaurin. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nEach soft capsule contains approximately 83 mg ethanol anhydrous and 415 mg macrogolglycerol \n\nhydroxystearate. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSoft capsule (capsule). \n\n \n\nPale orange, oblong capsule with red imprint \u201cPKC NVR\u201d. The dimensions of the capsule are \n\napproximately 25.4 x 9.2 mm. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRydapt is indicated: \n\n\uf0b7 in combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high-dose cytarabine \n\nconsolidation chemotherapy, and for patients in complete response followed by Rydapt single \n\nagent maintenance therapy, for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia \n\n(AML) who are FLT3 mutation-positive (see section 4.2); \n\n\uf0b7 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis \n\n(ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast \n\ncell leukaemia (MCL). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with Rydapt should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer \n\ntherapies. \n\n \n\nBefore taking midostaurin, AML patients must have confirmation of FLT3 mutation (internal tandem \n\nduplication [ITD] or tyrosine kinase domain [TKD]) using a validated test. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRydapt should be taken orally twice daily at approximately 12-hour intervals. The capsules should be \n\ntaken with food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nProphylactic antiemetics should be administered in accordance with local medical practice as per \n\npatient tolerance. \n\n \n\nAML \n\nThe recommended dose of Rydapt is 50 mg orally twice daily. \n\n \n\nRydapt is dosed on days 8-21 of induction and consolidation chemotherapy cycles, and then for \n\npatients in complete response every day as single agent maintenance therapy until relapse for up to \n\n12 cycles of 28 days each (see section 4.1). In patients receiving a haematopoietic stem cell transplant \n\n(SCT), Rydapt should be discontinued 48 hours prior to the conditioning regimen for SCT. \n\n \n\nDose modifications in AML \n\nRecommendations for dose modifications of Rydapt in patients with AML are provided in Table 1. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Rydapt dose interruption, reduction and discontinuation recommendations in \n\npatients with AML \n\n \n\nPhase Criteria Rydapt dosing \n\nInduction, \n\nconsolidation and \n\nmaintenance \n\nGrade 3/4 pulmonary \n\ninfiltrates \n\nInterrupt Rydapt for the remainder of the cycle. \n\nResume Rydapt at the same dose when infiltrate \n\nresolves to Grade \u22641. \n\nOther Grade 3/4 \n\nnon-haematological toxicities \n\nInterrupt Rydapt until toxicities considered at \n\nleast possibly related to Rydapt have resolved to \n\nGrade \u22642, then resume Rydapt. \n\nQTc interval >470 msecs and \n\n\u2264500 msecs \n\nDecrease Rydapt to 50 mg once daily for the \n\nremainder of the cycle. Resume Rydapt at the \n\ninitial dose in the next cycle provided that QTc \n\ninterval improves to \u2264470 msecs at the start of \n\nthat cycle. Otherwise continue Rydapt 50 mg \n\nonce daily. \n\nQTc interval >500 msecs Withhold or interrupt Rydapt for the remainder \n\nof the cycle. If QTc improves to \u2264470 msecs just \n\nprior to the next cycle, resume Rydapt at the \n\ninitial dose. If QTc interval is not improved in \n\ntime to start the next cycle do not administer \n\nRydapt during that cycle. Rydapt may be held \n\nfor as many cycles as necessary until QTc \n\nimproves. \n\nMaintenance only Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \n\n<0.5 x 109/l) \n\nInterrupt Rydapt until ANC \u22651.0 x 109/l, then \n\nresume at 50 mg twice daily. \n\nIf neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/l) \n\npersists >2 weeks and is suspected to be related \n\nto Rydapt, discontinue Rydapt. \n\nPersistent Grade 1/2 toxicity Persistent Grade 1 or 2 toxicity that patients \n\ndeem unacceptable may prompt an interruption \n\nfor as many as 28 days. \n\nANC: Absolute Neutrophil Count \n\n \n\nASM, SM-AHN and MCL \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Rydapt is 100 mg orally twice daily. \n\n \n\nTreatment should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity \n\noccurs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nDose modifications in ASM, SM-AHN and MCL \n\nRecommendations for dose modifications of Rydapt in patients with ASM, SM-AHN and MCL are \n\nprovided in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Rydapt dose interruption, reduction and discontinuation recommendations in \n\npatients with ASM, SM-AHN or MCL \n\n \n\nCriteria Rydapt dosing \n\nANC <1.0 x 109/l attributed to Rydapt in patients \n\nwithout MCL, or ANC less than 0.5 x 109/l \n\nattributed to Rydapt in patients with baseline \n\nANC value of 0.5-1.5 x 109/l \n\nInterrupt Rydapt until ANC \u22651.0 x 109/l, then \n\nresume at 50 mg twice daily and, if tolerated, \n\nincrease to 100 mg twice daily. \n\nDiscontinue Rydapt if low ANC persists \n\nfor >21 days and is suspected to be related to \n\nRydapt. \n\nPlatelet count less than 50 x 109/l attributed to \n\nRydapt in patients without MCL, or platelet count \n\nless than 25 x 109/l attributed to Rydapt in \n\npatients with baseline platelet count of \n\n25-75 x 109/l \n\nInterrupt Rydapt until platelet count greater than \n\nor equal to 50 x 109/l, then resume Rydapt at \n\n50 mg twice daily and, if tolerated, increase to \n\n100 mg twice daily. \n\nDiscontinue Rydapt if low platelet count persists \n\nfor >21 days and is suspected to be related to \n\nRydapt. \n\nHaemoglobin less than 8 g/dl attributed to Rydapt \n\nin patients without MCL, or life-threatening \n\nanaemia attributed to Rydapt in patients with \n\nbaseline haemoglobin value of 8-10 g/dl \n\nInterrupt Rydapt until haemoglobin greater than \n\nor equal to 8 g/dl, then resume Rydapt at 50 mg \n\ntwice daily and, if tolerated, increase to 100 mg \n\ntwice daily. \n\nDiscontinue Rydapt if low haemoglobin persists \n\nfor >21 days and is suspected to be related to \n\nRydapt. \n\nGrade 3/4 nausea and/or vomiting despite optimal \n\nanti-emetic therapy \n\nInterrupt Rydapt for 3 days (6 doses), then resume \n\nat 50 mg twice daily and, if tolerated, gradually \n\nincrease to 100 mg twice daily. \n\nOther Grade 3/4 non-haematological toxicities Interrupt Rydapt until event has resolved to \n\nGrade \u22642, then resume Rydapt at 50 mg twice \n\ndaily and, if tolerated, increase to 100 mg twice \n\ndaily. \n\nDiscontinue Rydapt if toxicity is not resolved to \n\nGrade \u22642 within 21 days or severe toxicity recurs \n\nat a reduced dose of Rydapt. \n\nANC: Absolute Neutrophil Count \n\nCTCAE severity: Grade 1 = mild symptoms; 2 = moderate symptoms; 3 = severe symptoms; \n\n4 = life-threatening symptoms. \n\n \n\nMissed doses \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should take the next dose at the scheduled time. \n\n \n\nIf vomiting occurs, the patient should not take an additional dose of Rydapt, but should take the next \n\nscheduled dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly (\u226565 years) \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients aged over 65 years (see section 5.2). There is limited \n\nexperience with midostaurin in AML patients aged 60-70 years and no experience in AML patients \n\nabove 70 years. In patients aged \u226560 years, Rydapt should be used only in patients eligible to receive \n\nintensive induction chemotherapy with adequate performance status and without significant \n\ncomorbidities. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Clinical \n\nexperience in patients with severe renal impairment is limited and no data are available in patients \n\nwith end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh A or B) hepatic \n\nimpairment (see section 5.2). No study has been completed in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) \n\nhepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAcute promyelocytic leukaemia \n\nRydapt has not been studied in patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia and therefore its use is not \n\nrecommended in this patient population. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nRydapt should not be used in combination with intensive paediatric AML combination chemotherapy \n\nregimens including anthracyclines, fludarabine and cytarabine because of the risk of prolonged \n\nhaematological recovery (such as prolonged severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nRydapt is for oral use. \n\n \n\nThe capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. They should not be opened, crushed or \n\nchewed to ensure proper dosing and avoid the unpleasant taste of the capsule content. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers, e.g. rifampicin, St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum \n\nperforatum), carbamazepine, enzalutamide, phenytoin (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and infections \n\n \n\nNeutropenia has occurred in patients receiving Rydapt as monotherapy and in combination with \n\nchemotherapy (see section 4.8). Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/l) was generally reversible by \n\nwithholding Rydapt until recovery and discontinuation in the ASM, SM-AHN and MCL studies. \n\nWhite blood cell counts (WBCs) should be monitored regularly, especially at treatment initiation. \n\n \n\nIn patients who develop unexplained severe neutropenia, treatment with Rydapt should be interrupted \n\nuntil ANC is \u22651.0 x 109/l, as recommended in Tables 1 and 2. Rydapt should be discontinued in \n\npatients who develop recurrent or prolonged severe neutropenia that is suspected to be related to \n\nRydapt (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAny active serious infection should be under control prior to starting treatment with Rydapt \n\nmonotherapy. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, including any \n\ndevice-related infections, and if a diagnosis of infection is made appropriate treatment must be \n\ninstituted promptly, including, as needed, the discontinuation of Rydapt. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nCardiac dysfunction \n\n \n\nPatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure were excluded from clinical studies. In the ASM, \n\nSM-AHN and MCL studies cardiac dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) (including \n\nsome fatalities) and transient decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) occurred. In the \n\nrandomised AML study no difference in CHF was observed between the Rydapt + chemotherapy and \n\nplacebo + chemotherapy arms. In patients at risk, Rydapt should be used with caution and the patient \n\nclosely monitored by assessing LVEF when clinically indicated (at baseline and during treatment). \n\n \n\nAn increased frequency of QTc prolongation was noted in midostaurin\u2013treated patients (see \n\nsection 4.8), however, a mechanistic explanation for this observation was not found. Caution is \n\nwarranted in patients at risk of QTc prolongation (e.g. due to concomitant medicinal products and/or \n\nelectrolyte disturbances). Interval assessments of QT by ECG should be considered if Rydapt is taken \n\nconcurrently with medicinal products that can prolong QT interval. \n\n \n\nPulmonary toxicity \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, in some cases fatal, have occurred in patients treated \n\nwith Rydapt monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Patients should be monitored for \n\npulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis and Rydapt discontinued in patients who \n\nexperience pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis that are \u2265Grade 3 (NCI CTCAE). \n\n \n\nEmbryofoetal toxicity and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nPregnant women should be informed of the potential risk to a foetus; females of reproductive potential \n\nshould be advised to have a pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting treatment with Rydapt and to \n\nuse effective contraception during treatment with Rydapt and for at least 4 months after stopping \n\ntreatment. Women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method of contraception. \n\n \n\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants from Rydapt, women \n\nshould discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with Rydapt and for at least 4 months after \n\nstopping treatment (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\n \n\nRydapt should not be used in combination with intensive paediatric AML combination \n\nchemotherapy regimens including anthracyclines, fludarabine and cytarabine because of the risk of \n\nprolonged haematological recovery (such as prolonged severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) \n\n(see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nSevere hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nCaution is warranted when considering the administration of midostaurin in patients with severe \n\nhepatic impairment and patients should be carefully monitored for toxicity (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nSevere renal impairment \n\n \n\nCaution is warranted when considering the administration of midostaurin in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment or end-stage renal disease and patients should be carefully monitored for toxicity (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nInteractions \n\n \n\nCaution is required when concomitantly prescribing with midostaurin medicinal products that are \n\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as, but not limited to, antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole), certain \n\nantivirals (e.g. ritonavir), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin) and nefazodone because they can \n\nincrease the plasma concentrations of midostaurin especially when (re-)starting with midostaurin \n\ntreatment (see section 4.5). Alternative medicinal products that do not strongly inhibit CYP3A4 \n\nactivity should be considered. In situations where satisfactory therapeutic alternatives do not exist, \n\npatients should be closely monitored for midostaurin-related toxicity. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate, which may cause stomach \n\ndiscomfort and diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 666 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each 200 mg dose (maximum daily \n\ndose), which is equivalent to 14 vol. % ethanol anhydrous. The amount in a 200 mg dose of this \n\nmedicine is equivalent to 16.9 ml beer or 7.0 ml wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine \n\nwill not have any noticeable effects. Alcohol may be harmful in patients with alcohol-related \n\nproblems, epilepsy or liver problems or during pregnancy or breast-feeding. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nMidostaurin undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism mainly through CYP3A4 enzymes which are \n\neither induced or inhibited by a number of concomitant medicinal products. \n\n \n\nEffect of other medicinal products on Rydapt \n\n \n\nMedicinal products or substances known to affect the activity of CYP3A4 may affect the plasma \n\nconcentrations of midostaurin and therefore the safety and/or efficacy of Rydapt. \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A4 inducers \n\nConcomitant use of Rydapt with strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampicin, \n\nenzalutamide, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s Wort [Hypericum perforatum]) is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease exposure of midostaurin and its active metabolites \n\n(CGP52421 and CGP62221). In a study in healthy subjects, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 \n\ninducer rifampicin (600 mg daily) to steady state with a 50 mg single dose of midostaurin decreased \n\nmidostaurin Cmax by 73% and AUCinf by 96% on average, respectively. CGP62221 exhibited a similar \n\npattern. The mean AUClast of CGP52421 decreased by 60%. \n\n \n\nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase midostaurin blood concentrations. In a study with 36 healthy \n\nsubjects, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole to steady state with a single \n\ndose of 50 mg midostaurin led to a significant increase in midostaurin exposure (1.8-fold Cmax increase \n\nand 10-fold AUCinf increase) and 3.5-fold increase in AUCinf of CGP62221, while the Cmax of the \n\nactive metabolites (CGP62221 and CGP52421) decreased by half (see section 5.2). At steady state of \n\nmidostaurin (50 mg twice daily for 21 days), with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole at steady \n\nstate in a subset of patients (N=7), midostaurin steady-state exposure (Cmin) was increased by \n\n2.09-fold. Cmin of CGP52421 was increased by 1.3-fold, whereas no significant effect in exposure of \n\nCGP62221 was observed (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nEffect of Rydapt on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nMidostaurin is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vivo. The pharmacokinetics of midazolam (sensitive \n\nCYP3A4 probe) were not affected following three days\u2019 dosing of midostaurin in healthy subjects. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nBased on in vitro data, midostaurin and/or its metabolites have the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, \n\nCYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 enzymes. \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro data, midostaurin and/or its metabolites have the potential to induce CYP1A2, \n\nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 enzymes. Midostaurin inhibited OATP1B1, \n\nBCRP and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro (see section 5.2). The combination of data on in vivo \n\nmidostaurin auto-induction upon repeated dosing and increase in plasma 4\u03b2-OH cholesterol levels \n\nsuggest that midostaurin may be at least a moderate CYP3A4 inducer in vivo. \n\n \n\nIn vivo studies have not been conducted for the investigation of induction and inhibition of enzymes \n\nand transporters by midostaurin and the active metabolites. Medicinal products with a narrow \n\ntherapeutic range that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g. tizanidine), CYP2D6 (e.g. codeine), CYP2C8 \n\n(e.g. paclitaxel), CYP2C9 (e.g. warfarin), CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole), CYP2E1 (e.g. chlorzoxazone), \n\nCYP3A4/5 (e.g. tacrolimus), CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz), P-gp (e.g. paclitaxel), BCRP (e.g. atorvastatin) \n\nor OATP1B1 (e.g. digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with \n\nmidostaurin and may need dose adjustment to maintain optimal exposure (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nIt is currently unknown whether midostaurin may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, \n\nand therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method of contraception (see \n\nsection 4.6). \n\n \n\nFood interactions \n\n \n\nIn healthy subjects, midostaurin absorption (AUC) was increased by an average of 22% when Rydapt \n\nwas co-administered with a standard meal and by an average of 59% when co-administered with a \n\nhigh-fat meal. Peak midostaurin concentration (Cmax) was reduced by 20% with a standard meal and \n\nby 27% with a high-fat meal versus on an empty stomach (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRydapt is recommended to be administered with food. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be informed that animal studies show midostaurin to be \n\nharmful to the developing foetus. Sexually active women of childbearing potential are advised to have \n\na pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting treatment with Rydapt and that they should use \n\neffective contraception (methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) when using Rydapt and \n\nfor at least 4 months after stopping treatment with Rydapt. It is currently unknown whether \n\nmidostaurin may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using \n\nhormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method of contraception. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nMidostaurin can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate \n\nand well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated \n\nthat midostaurin induced foetotoxicity (see section 5.3). Rydapt is not recommended during pregnancy \n\nor in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Pregnant women should be advised of \n\nthe potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether midostaurin or its active metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \n\nanimal data have shown that midostaurin and its active metabolites pass into the milk of lactating rats. \n\nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Rydapt and for at least 4 months after \n\nstopping treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the effect of Rydapt on human fertility. Animal studies with midostaurin have \n\nshown impaired fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nRydapt has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and vertigo have been \n\nreported in patients taking Rydapt and should be considered when assessing a patient\u2019s ability to drive \n\nor use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAML \n\nThe safety evaluation of Rydapt (50 mg twice daily) in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated \n\nAML is based on a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 717 patients. \n\nThe overall median duration of exposure was 42 days (range 2 to 576 days) for patients in the Rydapt \n\nplus standard chemotherapy arm versus 34 days (range 1 to 465 days) for patients in the placebo plus \n\nstandard chemotherapy arm. For the 205 patients (120 in Rydapt arm and 85 in placebo arm) who \n\nentered the maintenance phase, the median duration of exposure in maintenance was 11 months for \n\nboth arms (16 to 520 days for patients in the Rydapt arm and 22 to 381 days in the placebo arm). \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the Rydapt arm were febrile neutropenia (83.4%), \n\nnausea (83.4%), exfoliative dermatitis (61.6%), vomiting (60.7%), headache (45.9%), petechiae \n\n(35.8%) and pyrexia (34.5%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 ADRs were febrile neutropenia (83.5%), \n\nlymphopenia (20.0%), device-related infection (15.7%), exfoliative dermatitis (13.6%), \n\nhyperglycaemia (7.0%) and nausea (5.8%). The most frequent laboratory abnormalities were \n\nhaemoglobin decreased (97.3%), ANC decreased (86.7%), ALT increased (84.2%), AST increased \n\n(73.9%) and hypokalaemia (61.7%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities were ANC \n\ndecreased (85.8%), haemoglobin decreased (78.5%), ALT increased (19.4%) and hypokalaemia \n\n(13.9%). \n\n \n\nSerious ADRs occurred at similar rates in patients in the Rydapt versus the placebo arm. The most \n\nfrequent serious ADR in both arms was febrile neutropenia (16%). \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 3.1% of patients in the Rydapt arm versus \n\n1.3% in the placebo arm. The most frequent Grade 3/4 adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in \n\nthe Rydapt arm was exfoliative dermatitis (1.2%). \n\n \n\nSafety profile during maintenance phase \n\nWhile Table 3 provides the incidence for ADRs over the total duration of the study, when the \n\nmaintenance phase (single agent Rydapt or placebo) was assessed separately, a difference in the type \n\nand severity of ADRs was observed. The overall incidence of ADRs during the maintenance phase \n\nwas generally lower than during the induction and consolidation phase. Incidences of ADRs were, \n\nhowever, higher in the Rydapt arm than in the placebo arm during the maintenance phase. ADRs \n\noccurring more often in the midostaurin arm versus placebo during maintenance included: nausea \n\n(46.4% versus 17.9%), hyperglycaemia (20.2% versus 12.5%), vomiting (19% versus 5.4%) and QT \n\nprolongation (11.9% versus 5.4%). \n\n \n\nMost of the haematological abnormalities reported occurred during the induction and consolidation \n\nphase when the patients received Rydapt or placebo in combination with chemotherapy. The most \n\nfrequent Grade 3/4 haematological abnormalities reported in patients during the maintenance phase \n\nwith Rydapt were ANC decrease (20.8% versus 18.8%) and leukopenia (7.5% versus 5.9%). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nADRs reported during the maintenance phase led to discontinuation of 1.2% of patients in the Rydapt \n\narm and none in the placebo arm. \n\n \n\nASM, SM-AHN and MCL \n\nThe safety of Rydapt (100 mg twice daily) as a single agent in patients with ASM, SM-AHN and \n\nMCL was evaluated in 142 patients in two single-arm, open-label, multicentre studies. The median \n\nduration of exposure to Rydapt was 11.4 months (range: 0 to 81 months). \n\n \n\nThe most frequent ADRs were nausea (82%), vomiting (68%), diarrhoea (51%), peripheral oedema \n\n(35%) and fatigue (31%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 ADRs were fatigue (8.5%), sepsis (7.7%), \n\npneumonia (7%), febrile neutropenia (7%), and diarrhoea (6.3%). The most frequent \n\nnon-haematological laboratory abnormalities were hyperglycaemia (93.7%), total bilirubin increased \n\n(40.1%), lipase increased (39.4%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (33.8%), and alanine \n\naminotransferase (ALT) increased (33.1%), while the most frequent haematological laboratory \n\nabnormalities were absolute lymphocyte count decreased (73.2%) and ANC decreased (58.5%). The \n\nmost frequent Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities were absolute lymphocyte count decreased (45.8%), \n\nANC decreased (26.8%), hyperglycaemia (19%), and lipase increased (17.6%). \n\n \n\nDose modifications (interruption or adjustment) due to ADRs occurred in 31% of patients. The most \n\nfrequent ADRs that led to dose modification (incidence \u22655%) were nausea and vomiting. \n\n \n\nADRs that led to treatment discontinuation occurred in 9.2% of patients. The most frequent (incidence \n\n\u22651%) were febrile neutropenia, nausea, vomiting and pleural effusion. \n\n \n\nTabulated lists of adverse drug reactions \n\n \n\nADRs are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the ADRs \n\nare ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first, using the following convention \n\n(CIOMS III): very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); \n\nrare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE39 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nMidostaurin inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including FLT3 and KIT kinase. Midostaurin \n\ninhibits FLT3 receptor signalling and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in leukaemic cells \n\nexpressing FLT3 ITD or TKD mutant receptors or over-expressing FLT3 wild type receptors. In vitro \n\ndata indicate that midostaurin inhibits D816V mutant KIT receptors at exposure levels achieved in \n\npatients (average achieved exposure higher than IC50). In vitro data indicate that KIT wild type \n\nreceptors are inhibited to a much lesser extent at these concentrations (average achieved exposure \n\nlower than IC50). Midostaurin interferes with aberrant KIT D816V-mediated signalling and inhibits \n\nmast cell proliferation, survival and histamine release. \n\n \n\nIn addition, midostaurin inhibits several other receptor tyrosine kinases such as PDGFR \n\n(platelet-derived growth factor receptor) or VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), \n\nas well as members of the serine/threonine kinase family PKC (protein kinase C). Midostaurin binds to \n\nthe catalytic domain of these kinases and inhibits the mitogenic signalling of the respective growth \n\nfactors in cells, resulting in growth arrest. \n\n \n\nMidostaurin in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (cytarabine, doxorubicin, idarubicin and \n\ndaunorubicin) resulted in synergistic growth inhibition in FLT3-ITD expressing AML cell lines. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nTwo major metabolites have been identified in murine models and humans, i.e. CGP62221 and \n\nCGP52421. In proliferation assays with FLT3-ITD expressing cells, CGP62221 showed similar \n\npotency compared to the parent compound, however CGP52421 was approximately 10-fold less \n\npotent. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nA dedicated QT study in 192 healthy subjects with a dose of 75 mg twice daily did not reveal \n\nclinically significant prolongation of QT by midostaurin and CGP62221 but the study duration was not \n\nlong enough to estimate the QTc prolongation effects of the long-acting metabolite CGP52421. \n\nTherefore, the change from baseline in QTcF with the concentration of midostaurin and both \n\nmetabolites was further explored in a phase II study in 116 patients with ASM, SM-AHN or MCL. At \n\nthe median peak Cmin concentrations attained at a dose of 100 mg twice daily, neither midostaurin, \n\nCGP62221 nor CGP52421 showed a potential to cause clinically significant QTcF prolongation, since \n\nthe upper bounds of predicted change at these concentration levels were less than 10 msecs (5.8, 2.4, \n\nand 4.0 msecs, respectively). In the ASM, SM-AHN and MCL population, 25.4% of patients had at \n\nleast one ECG measurement with a QTcF greater than 450 ms and 4.7% greater than 480 ms. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nAML \n\nThe efficacy and safety of midostaurin in combination with standard chemotherapy versus placebo \n\nplus standard chemotherapy and as single agent maintenance therapy was investigated in 717 patients \n\n(18 to 60 years of age) in a randomised, double-blind, phase III study. Patients with newly diagnosed \n\nFLT3-mutated AML as determined by a clinical study assay were randomised (1:1) to receive \n\nmidostaurin 50 mg twice daily (n=360) or placebo (n=357) sequentially in combination with standard \n\ndaunorubicin (60 mg/m2 daily on days 1-3) / cytarabine (200 mg/m2 daily on days 1-7) induction and \n\nhigh-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, 5) consolidation, followed by continuous \n\nmidostaurin or placebo treatment according to initial assignment for up to 12 additional cycles \n\n(28 days/cycle). While the study included patients with various AML-related cytogenetic \n\nabnormalities, patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (M3) or therapy-related AML were \n\nexcluded. Patients were stratified by FLT3 mutation status: TKD, ITD with allelic ratio <0.7, and ITD \n\nwith allelic ratio \u22650.7. \n\n \n\nThe two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to the baseline demographics of \n\ndisease characteristics. The median age of the patients was 47 years (range: 18 to 60 years), a majority \n\nof the patients had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (88.3%), and most patients had de novo AML \n\n(95%). Of the patients with race information reported, 88.1% were Caucasian. The majority of patients \n\n(77.4%) had FLT3-ITD mutations, most of them (47.6%) with a low allelic ratio (<0.7), and 22.6% of \n\npatients had FLT3-TKD mutations. Forty-eight per cent were male in the midostaurin arm and 41% in \n\nthe placebo arm. \n\n \n\nPatients who proceeded to haematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) stopped receiving study \n\ntreatment prior to the start of the SCT conditioning regimen. The overall rate of SCT was 59.4% \n\n(214/360) of patients in the midostaurin plus standard chemotherapy arm versus 55.2% (197/357) in \n\nthe placebo plus standard chemotherapy arm. All patients were followed for survival. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was overall survival (OS), measured from the date of randomisation \n\nuntil death by any cause. The primary analysis was conducted after a minimum follow-up of \n\napproximately 3.5 years after the randomisation of the last patient. The study demonstrated a \n\nstatistically significant improvement in OS with a 23% risk reduction of death for midostaurin plus \n\nstandard chemotherapy over placebo plus standard chemotherapy (see Table 6 and Figure 1). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival, non-censored for SCT \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe key secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS; an EFS event is defined as a failure to \n\nobtain a complete remission (CR) within 60 days of initiation of protocol therapy, or relapse, or death \n\nfrom any cause).

Midostaurin was administered orally at 100 mg twice daily until disease \n\nprogression or intolerable toxicity. Of the 116 patients enrolled, 89 were considered eligible for \n\nresponse assessment and constituted the primary efficacy population. Of these, 73 patients had ASM \n\n(57 with an AHN) and 16 patients had MCL (6 with an AHN). The median age in the primary efficacy \n\npopulation was 64 years with approximately half of the patients \u226565 years. Approximately one third \n\n(36%) received prior anti-neoplastic therapy for ASM, SM-AHN or MCL.At baseline in the primary \n\nefficacy population, 65% of the patients had >1 measurable C finding (thrombocytopenia, \n\nhypoalbuminaemia, anaemia, high total bilirubin, transfusion-dependent anaemia, weight loss, \n\nneutropenia, high ALT or high AST). The KIT D816V mutation was detected in 82% of patients. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Response rates were assessed based on the \n\nmodified Valent and Cheson criteria and responses were adjudicated by a study steering committee. \n\nSecondary endpoints included duration of response, time to response, and overall survival. Responses \n\nto midostaurin are shown in Table 7. Activity was observed regardless of number of prior therapies, \n\nand presence or absence of an AHN. Confirmed responses were observed in both KIT D816V \n\nmutation positive patients (ORR=63%) and KIT D816V wild type or unknown patients \n\n(ORR=43.8%). However, the median survival for KIT D816V positive patients was longer, i.e. \n\n33.9 months (95% CI: 20.7, 42), than for KIT D816V wild type or unknown patients, i.e. 10 months \n\n(95% CI: 6.9, 17.4). Forty-six percent of patients had a decrease in bone marrow infiltration that \n\nexceeded 50% and 58% had a decrease in serum tryptase levels that exceeded 50%.

Midostaurin was administered orally at 100 mg twice \n\ndaily in cycles of 28 days. Lack of a major response (MR) or partial response (PR) by the end of the \n\nsecond cycle required discontinuation from the study treatment. Twenty (76.9%) patients had ASM \n\n(17 [85%] with AHN) and 6 patients (23.1%) had MCL (2 [33.3%] with AHN). The median age was \n\n64.5 years with half of the patients \u226565 years). At baseline, 88.5% had >1 C finding and 69.2% had \n\nreceived at least one prior anti-neoplastic regimen. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was ORR evaluated by the Valent criteria during the first two cycles of \n\ntreatment. Nineteen patients (73.1%; 95% CI = [52.2, 88.4]) achieved a response during the first two \n\ncycles of treatment (13 MR; 6 PR). The median duration of follow-up was 73 months, and the median \n\nduration of response has not been reached. Median overall survival was 40.0 months (patients were \n\nonly followed up for one year after treatment discontinuation for survival). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIn a phase II study, midostaurin was investigated in combination with chemotherapy in newly \n\ndiagnosed paediatric patients with FLT3-mutated AML. Among the three FLT3-mutated AML \n\npatients enrolled in the study, two patients (10 and 14 years old) experienced dose limiting toxicities \n\n(DLTs) following the second induction cycle with midostaurin (at 30 mg/m2 twice daily) in \n\ncombination with chemotherapy (containing cytarabine 2 g/m2/day, day 1-5; fludarabine \n\n30 mg/m2/day, day 1-5 and idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day, day 2, 4 and 6). Both patients showed markedly \n\ndelayed haematological recoveries (i.e. prolonged grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting for 44 days in the \n\nfirst patient and 51 days in the second patient and grade 4 neutropenia lasting for 46 days in the second \n\npatient). In the first induction cycle both patients received midostaurin in combination with cytarabine, \n\netoposide and idarubicin. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRydapt in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant mastocytosis and mast \n\ncell leukaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRydapt in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of acute myeloid \n\nleukaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nMidostaurin is a compound with good absorption and poor solubility. Two of its metabolites \n\ndemonstrated pharmacological activities (CGP52421 and CGP62221). Following multiple doses, the \n\npharmacokinetics of midostaurin and CGP62221 were time-dependent, with an initial increase \n\nobserved in the first week followed by a decline of concentrations until reaching steady state on \n\nday 28. CGP52421 concentrations do not appear to decline as significantly as for midostaurin and \n\nCGP62221. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of midostaurin following oral administration is not known. \n\n \n\nIn humans, the absorption of midostaurin was rapid after oral administration, with Tmax of total \n\nradioactivity observed at 1-3 hours post dose. The population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that \n\nthe absorption in patients was less than dose proportional at doses >50 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nIn healthy subjects, after administration of a single dose of 50 mg midostaurin with food, AUC of \n\nmidostaurin was increased to 20800 ng*h/ml and Cmax was decreased to 963 ng/ml (see section 4.5). \n\nSimilarly, for CGP52421 and CGP62221 AUC increased to 19000 and 29200 ng*h/ml and Cmax \n\ndecreased to 172 and 455 ng/ml, respectively. Time to peak concentration was also delayed in the \n\npresence of a high-fat meal. Tmax was delayed for all entities, midostaurin median Tmax was 3 h, and for \n\nCGP52421 and CGP62221 Tmax was delayed to 6 and 7 hours respectively. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, the efficacy and safety of Rydapt were investigated following administration with a \n\nlight meal. After oral administration of a single 100 mg dose of midostaurin under fed conditions in \n\nASM, SM-AHN and MCL patients, AUCinf, Cmax and Tmax were 49600 ng*h/ml, 2940 ng/ml and 3 h, \n\nrespectively, for midostaurin. For CGP52421, AUC0-12h and Cmax were 2770 ng*h/ml and 299 ng/ml, \n\nrespectively. AUC0-12h and Cmax for CGP62221 were 8700 ng*h/ml and 931 ng/ml, respectively. After \n\n100 mg bid multiple oral doses of midostaurin the Cmin,ss plasma midostaurin in AML and ASM, SM-\n\nAHN, MCL patients were 919 and 1060 ng/ml, respectively. The CGP62221 Cmin, ss in the AML and \n\nthe ASM, SM-AHN, MCL population were 1610 ng/ml and 2020 ng/ml, respectively. The CGP52421, \n\nCmin,ss in the AML and the ASM, SM-AHN, MCL population were 8630 ng/ml and 2860 ng/ml, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nMidostaurin has a tissue distribution of geometric mean of 95.2 l (Vz/F). Midostaurin and its \n\nmetabolites are distributed mainly in plasma rather than red blood cells. In vitro data showed \n\nmidostaurin is more than 98% bound to plasma proteins, such as albumin, \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP) \n\nand lipoprotein. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nMidostaurin is metabolised by CYP3A4 mainly via oxidative pathways. The major plasma \n\ncomponents included midostaurin and two major active metabolites, CGP62221 (via O-demethylation) \n\nand CGP52421 (via hydroxylation), accounting for 27.7\u00b12.7% and 38.0\u00b16.6%, respectively, of the \n\ntotal plasma exposure at 96 hours after a single 50 mg dose of midostaurin. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe median terminal half-lives of midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 in plasma are \n\napproximately 20.9, 32.3 and 471 hours. The mean apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) was 2.4-3.1 l/h \n\nin healthy subjects. In AML and ASM, SM-AHN and MCL patients, population pharmacokinetic \n\nestimates for clearance of midostaurin at steady state were 5.9 l/h and 4.4 l/h, respectively. The Human \n\nMass Balance study results indicated that faecal excretion is the major route of excretion (78% of the \n\ndose), and mostly as metabolites (73% of the dose), while unchanged midostaurin accounts for 3% of \n\nthe dose. Only 4% of the dose is recovered in urine. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nIn general, midostaurin and its metabolites showed no major deviation from dose-proportionality after \n\na single dose in the range of 25 mg to 100 mg. However, there was a less than dose-proportional \n\nincrease in exposure after multiple doses within the dose range of 50 mg to 225 mg daily. \n\n \n\nFollowing multiple oral doses, midostaurin displayed time-dependent pharmacokinetics with an initial \n\nincrease in plasma concentrations during the first week (peak Cmin) followed by a decline with time to \n\na steady-state after approximately 28 days (2.5-fold decrease). While the exact mechanism for the \n\ndeclining concentration of midostaurin is unclear, it is likely due to the auto-induction properties of \n\nmidostaurin and its two active metabolite CGP52421 and CGP62221 on CYP3A4. The \n\npharmacokinetics of the CGP62221 metabolite showed a similar trend. However, CGP52421 \n\nconcentrations increased up to 2.5-fold for ASM, SM-AHN and MCL and up to 9-fold for AML, \n\ncompared to midostaurin after one month of treatment. \n\n \n\nIn vitro evaluation of drug-drug interaction potential \n\n \n\nEnzyme drug-drug interactions \n\nCytochrome P450 inhibition \n\nBased on in vitro data, midostaurin and its active metabolites, CGP52421 and CGP62221, are \n\nconsidered inhibitors and may potentially cause increases in exposure of co-administered medicinal \n\nproducts primarily cleared by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5. In \n\naddition, a time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 by midostaurin, CGP52421 and CGP62221 was also \n\nobserved in vitro. \n\n \n\nCytochrome P450 induction \n\nBased on in vitro data, midostaurin and its active metabolites, CGP52421 and CGP62221, are also \n\nconsidered inducers and may cause decreases in exposure of co-administered medicinal products \n\nprimarily cleared by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nTransporter drug-drug interactions \n\nIn vitro experiments demonstrated that midostaurin, CGP52421 and CPG62221 can potentially inhibit \n\nP-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and BSEP. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses no significant impact of age on the pharmacokinetics \n\nof midostaurin and its two active metabolites was identified for patients aged between 65 and 85 years. \n\nIn adult patients with ASM, SM-AHN and MCL or AML, no midostaurin dose adjustment is required \n\nbased on age. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nRydapt is not recommended to be used in children and adolescents (see section 4.2).  \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of midostaurin in paediatric patients were explored in a phase I dose escalation \n\nmonotherapy study with 22 patients (12 aged 0-2 years and 10 aged 10-17 years) with AML or \n\nMLL-rearranged ALL using a population pharmacokinetic approach. The pharmacokinetics of \n\nmidostaurin were less than dose proportional with the doses of 30 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2 after single \n\nand multiple doses. Due to the limited pharmacokinetic data in paediatric patients, no comparison with \n\nmidostaurin pharmacokinetics in adults can be made. \n\n \n\n \n\nGender \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic model analyses of the effect of gender on clearance of \n\nmidostaurin and its active metabolites, there was no statistically significant finding and the anticipated \n\nchanges in exposure (<20%) were not deemed to be clinically relevant. No midostaurin dose \n\nadjustment is required based on gender. \n\n \n\nRace/ethnicity \n\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetic profile between Caucasian and Black subjects. Based \n\non a phase I study in healthy Japanese volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of midostaurin and its \n\nmetabolites (CGP62221 and CGP52421) are similar compared to those observed in other \n\npharmacokinetic studies conducted in Caucasians and Blacks. No midostaurin dose adjustment is \n\nrequired based on ethnicity. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nA dedicated hepatic impairment study assessed the systemic exposure of midostaurin after oral \n\nadministration of 50 mg twice daily for 6 days in subjects with baseline mild or moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B, respectively) and control subjects with normal hepatic function. \n\nThe maximum concentration was reached between 2 and 3 hours after administration after single or \n\nrepeated doses for all groups. On day 1, the AUC0-12 and Cmax were 8130 ng*h/ml and 1206 ng/ml, \n\nrespectively, for healthy subjects. AUC0-12 was decreased by 39% and 36% in subjects with mild and \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment, respectively. On day 7, AUCCtrough (exposure under the curve of Ctrough \n\nfrom day 1 to day 7) was 5410 ng*h/ml in healthy subjects and was decreased by 35% and 20% in \n\nsubjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. AUCtau was decreased by 28% and \n\n20% on day 7, respectively. Finally, the long-term data from patients were analysed using a population \n\npharmacokinetic approach. No impact of hepatic impairment could be identified in patients with mild \n\nor moderate hepatic impairment in the ASM, SM-AHN, MCL and AML populations. \n\n \n\nOverall, there was no clinically relevant increase in exposure (AUC) to plasma midostaurin in subjects \n\nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. No \n\ndosage adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The \n\npharmacokinetics of midostaurin have not been assessed in patients with baseline severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nRenal elimination is a minor route of elimination for midostaurin. No dedicated renal impairment \n\nstudy was conducted for midostaurin. Population pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted using data \n\nfrom clinical studies in patients with AML (n=180) and ASM, SM-AHN and MCL (n=141). Out of the \n\n321 patients included, 177 patients showed pre-existing mild (n=113), moderate (n=60) or severe \n\n(n=4) renal impairment (15 ml/min \u2264 creatinine clearance [CrCL] <90 ml/min). 144 patients showed \n\nnormal renal function (CrCL >90 ml/min) at baseline. Based on the population pharmacokinetic \n\nanalyses, midostaurin clearance was not significantly impacted by renal impairment and therefore no \n\ndosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nDue to dose-limiting toxicity, clinical therapeutic exposure levels could not be reached in animals. All \n\nanimal findings described below were observed at midostaurin exposure significantly lower than \n\ntherapeutic levels. \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology and single/repeat dose toxicity \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies indicate that midostaurin is unlikely to interfere with vital functions of \n\nthe central nervous system. In vitro, midostaurin did not inhibit hERG channel activity up to the limit \n\nof solubility of 12 \u00b5M. The two major human metabolites GGP52421 and CGP62221 (also tested at \n\nthe limit of solubility) inhibited hERG current with moderate safety margins. In the repeat-dose \n\nstudies in dogs, a decrease in heart rate, prolongation of the P-Q interval, and sporadically occurring \n\natrioventricular blocks were seen in individual animals. \n\n \n\nIn the repeat-dose studies, target organs for toxicity were the gastrointestinal tract (emesis in dogs and \n\nmonkeys, diarrhoea and mucosal alteration), testes (decreased spermatogenesis), bone marrow \n\n(hypocellularity) and lymphoid organs (depletion/atrophy). The effect on the bone marrow and \n\nlymphoid organs was accompanied by haematological changes of decreased white blood cells, \n\nlymphocytes and erythrocytic parameters. An increase in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) was seen \n\nconsistently in rats, and in dogs and monkeys in long-term studies of \u22653 months duration, without \n\nhistopathological correlates. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity \n\n \n\nIn a fertility study in rats, midostaurin was associated with reduced fertility, testicular degeneration \n\nand atrophy, reduced sperm motility, oligo- and aspermia, increased resorptions, decreased pregnancy \n\nrate, number of implants and live embryos. \n\n \n\nIn embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, increased numbers of late resorptions, \n\nreduced foetal weight and reduced skeletal ossification were observed. \n\n \n\nIn a pre- and post-natal developmental study, maternal dystocia and reduced litter size, lower pup \n\nbody weights, accelerated complete eye opening and delayed auricular startle ontogeny were noted. \n\n \n\nJuvenile animal studies \n\n \n\nIn a toxicity study in juvenile rats, midostaurin was administered from days 7 to 70 postpartum. A \n\nreduction in body weight, haemorrhage and mixed cell infiltration in the lungs, and \n\nerythrocytosis/erythrophagocytosis in the mesenteric lymph nodes were seen. There were no effects on \n\nphysical development, sensory function or behavioural function. Mating index, fertility index and \n\nconception rates were reduced at 0, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day, but not at 2 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity \n\n \n\nIn vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity endpoints showed no evidence \n\nof mutagenic or clastogenic activity. No carcinogenicity studies have been performed. \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA) \n\n \n\nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that midostaurin has the potential to be persistent, \n\nbioaccumulative and toxic to the environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Rydapt is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Rydapt is \n\nRydapt contains the active substance midostaurin. It belongs to a class of medicines called protein \n\nkinase inhibitors. \n\n \n\nWhat Rydapt is used for \n\nRydapt is used to treat acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adults who have a defect in a gene called \n\nFLT3. Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of cancer of certain white blood cells (called myeloid cells) \n\nin which the body over-produces an abnormal type of these cells. \n\n \n\nRydapt is also used in adults to treat aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis \n\nwith associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL). These are \n\ndisorders in which the body produces too many mast cells, a type of white blood cell. Symptoms are \n\ncaused when too many mast cells enter organs such as the liver, bone marrow or spleen, and release \n\nsubstances such as histamine into the blood. \n\n \n\nHow Rydapt works \n\nMidostaurin blocks the action of some enzymes (kinases) in the abnormal cells and stops their division \n\nand growth. \n\n \n\nAt the start of treatment in AML Rydapt is always used together with chemotherapy (medicines for \n\ntreating cancer). \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Rydapt works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, \n\nask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rydapt \n\n \n\nFollow the doctor\u2019s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information in this leaflet. \n\n \n\nDo not take Rydapt \n\n- if you are allergic to midostaurin or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).

Talk to your doctor if you are \n\ntold that you have to start taking one of them during Rydapt treatment. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rydapt: \n\n- if you have any infections. \n\n- if you have a heart disorder. \n\n- if you have problems with your lungs or problems breathing. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse straight away if you get any of these symptoms during treatment \n\nwith Rydapt: \n\n- if you have fever, sore throat or mouth ulcers, because these may indicate that your white blood \n\ncell count is low. \n\n- if you have new or worsening symptoms such as fever, cough with or without mucous, chest \n\npain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, because these may be signs of infections or lung \n\nproblems. \n\n- if you have or experience chest pain or discomfort, light-headedness, fainting, dizziness, blue \n\ndiscolouration of your lips, hands or feet, shortness of breath, or swelling of your lower limbs \n\n(oedema) or skin, because these may be signs of heart problems. \n\nYour doctor may need to adjust, temporarily stop or completely discontinue your treatment with \n\nRydapt. \n\n \n\nMonitoring during treatment with Rydapt \n\nYour doctor will perform regular blood tests during treatment with Rydapt in order to monitor the \n\namount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) and electrolytes (e.g. calcium, \n\npotassium, magnesium) in your body. Your heart and lung function will also be checked regularly. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nRydapt should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age who are also receiving \n\nother chemotherapy, because it could cause a severe reduction of certain types of blood cells. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Rydapt \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This is because Rydapt can affect the way some medicines work. Some other medicines \n\ncan also affect how Rydapt works. \n\n \n\nThe following medicines must be avoided during treatment with Rydapt: \n\n- medicines used to treat tuberculosis, such as rifampicin; \n\n- medicines used to treat epilepsy, such as carbamazepine or phenytoin; \n\n- enzalutamide, a medicine used to treat prostate cancer; \n\n- St. John\u2019s Wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine used to treat \n\ndepression. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- some medicines used to treat infections, such as ketoconazole or clarithromycin; \n\n- some medicines used to treat HIV, such as ritonavir or efavirenz; \n\n- nefazadone, a medicine used to treat depression; \n\n- some medicines used to stop the body from rejecting organ transplants, such as tacrolimus; \n\n- some medicines used to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel or cyclophosphamide; \n\n- some medicines used to control levels of fat in your blood, such as atorvastatin; \n\n- digoxin, a medicine used to treat heart failure; \n\n- warfarin, a medicine used to treat and prevent thrombosis; \n\n- tizanidine, a medicine used to relax muscles; \n\n- codeine, a medicine used to treat pain; \n\n- omeprazole, a medicine to treat excessive stomach acid, ulcers and heartburn; \n\n- chlorzoxazone, a medicine used for treating discomfort caused by muscle spasms. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor might prescribe a different medicine for you \n\nduring your treatment with Rydapt. \n\n \n\nYou should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Rydapt and you are prescribed a new \n\nmedicine that you have not previously taken during treatment with Rydapt. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure whether your medicine is one of the medicines listed \n\nabove. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nRydapt may harm your unborn baby and is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, \n\nthink you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking \n\nthis medicine. \n\n \n\nRydapt could harm your baby. You should not breast-feed during treatment with Rydapt and for at \n\nleast 4 months after stopping the treatment. \n\n \n\nContraception in women \n\nIf you become pregnant while taking Rydapt, it may harm your baby. Your doctor will ask you to take \n\na pregnancy test before you start treatment with Rydapt to make sure you are not pregnant. You must \n\nuse an effective method of contraception while taking Rydapt and for at least 4 months after you have \n\nstopped taking it. If you use a hormonal contraceptive, you must also use a barrier method, such as a \n\ncondom or a diaphragm. Your doctor will discuss with you the most suitable method of contraception \n\nfor you to use. \n\n \n\nIf you become pregnant or think you are pregnant, tell your doctor right away. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nRydapt may reduce fertility in men and women. You should discuss this with your doctor before \n\nstarting treatment. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nTake special care when driving and using machines as you may develop dizziness and vertigo while \n\nyou are taking Rydapt. \n\n \n\nRydapt contains ethanol anhydrous (alcohol) \n\nThis medicine contains 666 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each 200 mg dose (maximum daily dose) which \n\nis equivalent to 14 vol. % ethanol anhydrous. The amount in a 200 mg dose of this medicine is \n\nequivalent to 16.9 ml beer or 7.0 ml wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have \n\nany noticeable effects. Alcohol may be harmful if you have alcohol-related problems, epilepsy or liver \n\nproblems, or if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nRydapt contains macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate (castor oil) \n\nThis medicine contains macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate, which may cause stomach discomfort and \n\ndiarrhoea. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

medicines called protein kinase inhibitors. what rydapt is used for rydapt is used to treat acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) in adults who have a defect in a gene called flt3. acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of cancer of certain white blood cells (called myeloid cells) in which the body over-produces an abnormal type of these cells. rydapt is also used in adults to treat aggressive systemic mastocytosis (asm), systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological neoplasm (sm-ahn), or mast cell leukaemia (mcl). these are disorders in which the body produces too many mast cells, a type of white blood cell. symptoms are caused when too many mast cells enter organs such as the liver, bone marrow or spleen, and release substances such as histamine into the blood. how rydapt works midostaurin blocks the action of some enzymes (kinases) in the abnormal cells and stops their division and growth. at the start of treatment in aml rydapt is always used together with chemotherapy (medicines for treating cancer). if you have any questions about how rydapt works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition":
