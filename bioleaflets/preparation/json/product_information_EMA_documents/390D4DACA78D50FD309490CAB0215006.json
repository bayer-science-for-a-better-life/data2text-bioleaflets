NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAVANDAMET 1 mg/500 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 1 mg of rosiglitazone (as rosiglitazone maleate) and 500 mg of metformin \nhydrochloride (corresponding to metformin free base 390 mg). \n \nExcipients: \nEach tablet contains lactose (approximately 6 mg). \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nYellow film-coated tablets marked \"gsk\" on one side and \"1/500\" on the other. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAVANDAMET is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, particularly \noverweight patients: \n- who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of oral \n\nmetformin alone. \n- in triple oral therapy with sulphonylurea in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite \n\ndual oral therapy with their maximally tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe usual starting dose of AVANDAMET is 4 mg/day rosiglitazone plus 2000 mg/day metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nRosiglitazone can be increased to 8 mg/day after 8 weeks if greater glycaemic control is required. The \nmaximum recommended daily dose of AVANDAMET is 8 mg rosiglitazone plus 2000 mg metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nThe total daily dose of AVANDAMET should be given in two divided doses. \n \nDose titration with rosiglitazone (added to the optimal dose of metformin) may be considered before \nthe patient is switched to AVANDAMET. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate, direct change from metformin monotherapy to AVANDAMET may be \nconsidered. \n \nTaking AVANDAMET with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with \nmetformin. \n \nTriple oral therapy (rosiglitazone, metformin and sulphonylurea) (see section 4.4) \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n3 \n\n- Patients on metformin and sulphonylurea: when appropriate AVANDAMET may be initiated at \n4 mg/day rosiglitazone with the dose of metformin substituting that already being taken.  An \nincrease in the rosiglitazone component to 8 mg/day should be undertaken cautiously following \nappropriate clinical evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing adverse reactions \nrelating to fluid retention (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n- Patients established on triple oral therapy: when appropriate, AVANDAMET may substitute \nrosiglitazone and metformin doses already being taken. \n\n \nWhere appropriate, AVANDAMET may be used to substitute concomitant rosiglitazone and \nmetformin in existing dual or triple oral therapy to simplify treatment. \n \nElderly \nAs metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal \nfunction, elderly patients taking AVANDAMET should have their renal function monitored regularly \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nAVANDAMET should not be used in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction, e.g. serum \ncreatinine levels > 135 μmol/l in males and > 110 μmol/l in females and/or creatinine clearance \n< 70 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAVANDAMET is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age as \nthere are no data available on its safety and efficacy in this age group (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nAVANDAMET is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n- hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone, to metformin hydrochloride or to any of the excipients \n- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) stages I to \n\nIV) \n- an Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI) (see section 4.4) \n- acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as: \n\n- cardiac or respiratory failure \n- recent myocardial infarction \n- shock \n\n- hepatic impairment \n- acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see section 4.4) \n- diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma \n- renal failure or renal dysfunction e.g. serum creatinine levels > 135 µmol/l in males and \n\n> 110 µmol/l in females and/or creatinine clearance < 70 ml/min (see section 4.4) \n- acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: \n\n- dehydration \n- severe infection \n- shock \n- intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see section 4.4) \n- lactation. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLactic acidosis \nLactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin \naccumulation.  Reported cases of lactic acidosis in patients on metformin have occurred primarily in \ndiabetic patients with significant renal failure.  The incidence of lactic acidosis can and should be \nreduced by also assessing other associated risk factors such as poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n4 \n\nprolonged fasting, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency and any conditions associated with \nhypoxia. \n \nDiagnosis: \nLactic acidosis is characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain and hypothermia followed by \ncoma.  Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH, plasma lactate levels above 5 mmol/l \nand an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio.  If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment \nwith the medicinal product should be discontinued and the patient hospitalised immediately (see \nsection 4.9). \n \nRenal function \nAs metformin is excreted by the kidney, serum creatinine concentrations should be determined \nregularly: \n- at least once a year in patients with normal renal function \n- at least two to four times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at the upper limit of \n\nnormal and in elderly patients. \n \n\nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic.  Special caution should be \nexercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating \nantihypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with an NSAID. \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \nThiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention which may exacerbate or precipitate signs or symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone can cause dose-dependent fluid retention.  The possible \ncontribution of fluid retention to weight gain should be individually assessed as rapid and excessive \nweight gain has been reported very rarely as a sign of fluid retention. All patients, particularly those \nreceiving concurrent insulin but also sulphonylurea therapy, those at risk for heart failure, and those \nwith reduced cardiac reserve, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions \nrelating to fluid retention, including weight gain and heart failure. AVANDAMET must be \ndiscontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.   \n \nThe use of AVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin may be associated with \nincreased risks of fluid retention and heart failure (see section 4.8).  The decision to initiate \nAVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea should include consideration of alternative \ntherapies. Increased monitoring of the patient is recommended if AVANDAMET is used in \ncombination particularly with insulin but also with a sulphonylurea.   \n \nHeart failure was also reported more frequently in patients with a history of heart failure; oedema and \nheart failure was also reported more frequently in elderly patients and in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal failure. Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited \nexperience in this patient group. Since NSAIDs, insulin and rosiglitazone are all associated with fluid \nretention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. \n \nCombination with insulin \nAn increased incidence of cardiac failure has been observed in clinical trials when rosiglitazone is \nused in combination with insulin. Insulin and rosiglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema and could increase the risk of ischaemic \nheart disease. Insulin should only be added to established rosiglitazone therapy in exceptional cases \nand under close supervision. \n \nMyocardial Ischaemia \nA retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies indicated that treatment \nwith rosiglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischaemic events. However, \nin their entirety the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive (see section 4.8).  \nThere are limited clinical trial data in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or peripheral arterial \ndisease. Therefore, as a precaution, the use of rosiglitazone is not recommended in these patients, \nparticularly those with myocardial ischaemic symptoms. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n5 \n\n \nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) \nPatients experiencing an ACS have not been studied in rosiglitazone controlled clinical trials. In view \nof the potential for development of heart failure in these patients, rosiglitazone should therefore not be \ninitiated in patients having an acute coronary event and it should be discontinued during the acute \nphase (see section 4.3). \n \nMonitoring of liver function \nThere have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience with \nrosiglitazone (see section 4.8).  There is limited experience with rosiglitazone in patients with elevated \nliver enzymes (ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal).  Therefore, liver enzymes should be \nchecked prior to the initiation of therapy with AVANDAMET in all patients and periodically \nthereafter based on clinical judgement.  Therapy with AVANDAMET should not be initiated in \npatients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) or \nwith any other evidence of liver disease.  If ALT levels are increased to > 3 times the upper limit of \nnormal during AVANDAMET therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible.  \nIf ALT levels remain > 3 times the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued.  If any \npatient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked.  The \ndecision whether to continue the patient on therapy with AVANDAMET should be guided by clinical \njudgement pending laboratory evaluations.  If jaundice is observed, therapy should be discontinued. \n \nEye disorders \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween rosiglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate ophthalmologic referral should \nbe considered. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials with rosiglitazone there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, which was greater \nwhen used in combination with insulin. Therefore weight should be closely monitored, given that it \nmay be attributable to fluid retention, which may be associated with cardiac failure. \n \nAnaemia \nRosiglitazone treatment is associated with a dose-related reduction of haemoglobin levels.  In patients \nwith low haemoglobin levels before initiating therapy, there is an increased risk of anaemia during \ntreatment with AVANDAMET. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nPatients receiving AVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin may be at risk for \ndose-related hypoglycaemia. Increased monitoring of the patient and a reduction in the dose of the \nconcomitant agent may be necessary. \n \nSurgery \nAs AVANDAMET contains metformin hydrochloride, the treatment should be discontinued 48 hours \nbefore elective surgery with general anaesthesia and should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 \nhours afterwards. \n \nAdministration of iodinated contrast agent \nThe intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies can lead to renal \nfailure.  Therefore, due to the metformin active substance, AVANDAMET should be discontinued \nprior to, or at the time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal \nfunction has been re-evaluated and found to be normal (see section 4.5). \n \nBone disorders \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n6 \n\nLong-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fractures in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). The majority of the fractures have occurred in the upper \nlimbs and distal lower limbs. In females, this increased incidence was noted after the first year of \ntreatment and persisted during long-term treatment. The risk of fracture should be considered in the \ncare of patients, especially female patients, treated with rosiglitazone. \n \nOther precautions \nPremenopausal women have received rosiglitazone during clinical studies.  Although hormonal \nimbalance has been seen in preclinical studies (see section 5.3), no significant undesirable effects \nassociated with menstrual disorders have been observed.  As a consequence of improving insulin \nsensitivity, resumption of ovulation may occur in patients who are anovulatory due to insulin \nresistance.  Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nAVANDAMET should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C8 inhibitors \n(e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin), due to the effect on rosiglitazone pharmacokinetics \n(see section 4.5). Furthermore, AVANDAMET should be used with caution during concomitant \nadministration of cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. \ncimetidine) due to the effect on metformin pharmacokinetics (see section 4.5). Glycaemic control \nshould be monitored closely. AVANDAMET dose adjustment within the recommended posology or \nchanges in diabetic treatment should be considered. \n \nAll patients should continue their diet with regular distribution of carbohydrate intake during the day.  \nOverweight patients should continue their energy-restricted diet. \nThe usual laboratory tests for diabetes monitoring should be performed regularly. \n \nAVANDAMET tablets contain lactose and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere have been no formal interaction studies for AVANDAMET, however the concomitant use of the \nactive substances in patients in clinical studies and in widespread clinical use has not resulted in any \nunexpected interactions.  The following statements reflect the information available on the individual \nactive substances (rosiglitazone and metformin). \n \nThere is increased risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication (particularly in the case of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic insufficiency) due to the metformin active substance of \nAVANDAMET (see section 4.4).  Avoid consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing \nalcohol. \n \nCationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may \ninteract with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted \nin seven normal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, \nincreased metformin systemic exposure (AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%. Therefore, close monitoring \nof glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular \nsecretion are co-administered (see section 4.4). \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with \nCYP2C9 as only a minor pathway.  \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) resulted in a twofold \nincrease in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. Since there is a potential for an increase in the risk of \ndose-related adverse reactions, a decrease in rosiglitazone dose may be needed. Close monitoring of \nglycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n7 \n\nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) resulted in a 66% decrease \nin rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. It cannot be excluded that other inducers (e.g. phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort) may also affect rosiglitazone exposure. The \nrosiglitazone dose may need to be increased. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4). \n \nClinically significant interactions with CYP2C9 substrates or inhibitors are not anticipated. \n \nConcomitant administration of rosiglitazone with the oral antihyperglycaemic agents glibenclamide \nand acarbose did not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin, the CYP3A4 \nsubstrates nifedipine, ethinylestradiol or norethindrone were observed after co-administration with \nrosiglitazone. \n \nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to renal failure, resulting in \nmetformin accumulation and a risk of lactic acidosis.  Metformin should be discontinued prior to, or at \nthe time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards and only after renal function has been \nre-evaluated and found to be normal. \n \nCombination requiring precautions for use \nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes) beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity.  The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperformed, especially at the beginning of treatment.  If necessary, the dosage of the \nantihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal \nproduct and on its discontinuation. \nACE-inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels.  If necessary, the dosage of the \nantihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal \nproduct and on its discontinuation. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor AVANDAMET no preclinical or clinical data on exposed pregnancies or lactation are available. \n \nRosiglitazone has been reported to cross the human placenta and to be detectable in foetal tissues. \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rosiglitazone in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The potential risk for humans is unknown.   \n \nTherefore, AVANDAMET should not be used during pregnancy. If a patient wishes to become \npregnant or if pregnancy occurs, treatment with AVANDAMET should be discontinued unless the \nexpected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBoth rosiglitazone and metformin have been detected in the milk of experimental animals.  It is not \nknown whether breast-feeding will lead to exposure of the infant to the medicinal product.  \nAVANDAMET must therefore not be used in women who are breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAVANDAMET has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions are presented below for each of the component parts of AVANDAMET. An adverse \nreaction is only presented for the fixed dose combination if it has not been seen in one of the \ncomponent parts of AVANDAMET or if it occurred at a higher frequency than that listed for a \ncomponent part. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n8 \n\n \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics. Adverse reaction frequency categories \nassigned based on clinical trial experience may not reflect the frequency of adverse events occurring \nduring normal clinical practice. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to \n<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000) and very rare (<1/10,000 \nincluding isolated reports). \n \nAVANDAMET \n \nData from double-blind studies confirm that the safety profile of concomitant rosiglitazone and \nmetformin is similar to that of the combined adverse reaction profile for the two medicinal products. \nData with AVANDAMET is also consistent with this combined adverse reaction profile. \n \nClinical trial data (addition of insulin to established AVANDAMET therapy) \nIn a single study (n=322) where insulin was added to patients established on AVANDAMET, no new \nadverse events were observed in excess of those already defined for either AVANDAMET or \nrosiglitazone combination therapies. \nHowever, the risk of both fluid related adverse events and hypoglycaemia are increased when \nAVANDAMET is used in combination with insulin. \n \nRosiglitazone \n \nClinical trial data \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics.  \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified from an overview of clinical trials involving over 5,000 \nrosiglitazone-treated patients. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in the \ntable by decreasing frequency for the rosiglitazone monotherapy treatment regimen. Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n9 \n\nTable 1.

The elevated total cholesterol levels were associated with \nan increase in both LDLc and HDLc, but the ratio of total cholesterol: HDLc was unchanged or \nimproved in long term studies.  Overall, these increases were generally mild to moderate and usually \ndid not require discontinuation of treatment. \n \n2 An increased incidence of heart failure has been observed when rosiglitazone was added to treatment \nregimens with a sulphonylurea (either as dual or triple therapy), and appeared higher with 8 mg \nrosiglitazone compared to 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose). The incidence of heart failure on triple \noral therapy was 1.4% in the main double blind study, compared to 0.4% for metformin plus \nsulphonylurea dual therapy.  The incidence of heart failure in combination with insulin (rosiglitazone \nadded to established insulin therapy) was 2.4%, compared to insulin alone, 1.1%.   \n \nIn a placebo-controlled one-year trial in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, \nworsening or possible worsening of heart failure occurred in 6.4% of patients treated with \nrosiglitazone, compared with 3.5% on placebo. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n10 \n\n \n3 In a retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies, the overall incidence of \nevents typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was higher for rosiglitazone containing regimens, \n2.00% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 1.53% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% \nconfidence interval (CI) 1.004 - 1.69)]. This risk was increased when rosiglitazone was added to \nestablished insulin and in patients receiving nitrates for known ischaemic heart disease. In an update to \nthis retrospective analysis that included 10 further studies that met the criteria for inclusion, but were \nnot available at the time of the original analysis, the overall incidence of events typically associated \nwith cardiac ischaemia was not statistically different for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.21% \nversus combined active and placebo comparators, 2.08% [HR 1.098 (95% CI 0.809 - 1.354)]. In a \nprospective cardiovascular outcomes study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) the primary endpoint events of \ncardiovascular death or hospitalisation were similar between rosiglitazone and active comparators [HR \n0.99 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.16)]. Two other long-term prospective randomised controlled clinical trials \n(9,620 patients, study duration >3 years in each study), comparing rosiglitazone to some other \napproved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, have not confirmed or excluded the potential risk of \ncardiac ischaemia. In their entirety, the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are \ninconclusive. \n \n4 Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fracture in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone. In a monotherapy study, the incidence in females for rosiglitazone was \n9.3% (2.7 patients per 100 patient years) vs 5.1% (1.5 patients per 100 patient years) for metformin or \n3.5% (1.3 patients per 100 patient years) for glibenclamide. In another long-term study, there was an \nincreased incidence of bone fracture for subjects in the combined rosiglitazone group compared to \nactive control [8.3% vs 5.3%, Risk ratio 1.57 (95% CI 1.26 - 1.97)]. The risk of fracture appeared to \nbe higher in females relative to control [11.5% vs 6.3%, Risk ratio 1.82 (95% CI 1.37 - 2.41)], than in \nmales relative to control [5.3% vs 4.3%, Risk ratio 1.23 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.77)]. Additional data are \nnecessary to determine whether there is an increased risk of fracture in males after a longer period of \nfollow-up. The majority of the fractures were reported in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn double-blind clinical trials with rosiglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three \ntimes the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo (0.2%) and less than that of the active \ncomparators (0.5% metformin/sulphonylureas). The incidence of all adverse events relating to liver \nand biliary systems was <1.5% in any treatment group and similar to placebo. \n \nPost-marketing data  \nIn addition to the adverse reactions identified from clinical trial data, the adverse reactions presented \nin Table 2 have been identified in post approval use of rosiglitazone.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n11 \n\nTable 2.

In clinical studies in \nvolunteers rosiglitazone has been administered at single oral doses of up to 20 mg and was well \ntolerated. \n \nA large overdose of metformin (or coexisting risks of lactic acidosis) may lead to lactic acidosis which \nis a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital.  \n \nIn the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment is initiated as \ndictated by the patient's clinical status.  The most effective method to remove lactate and metformin is \nhaemodialysis, however rosiglitazone is highly protein bound and is not cleared by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering medicinal products, ATC \ncode: A10BD03 \n \nAVANDAMET combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complimentary mechanisms of action \nto improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: rosiglitazone maleate, a member of the \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n13 \n\nthiazolidinedione class and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.  \nThiazolidinediones act primarily by reducing insulin resistance and biguanides act primarily by \ndecreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.  \n \nRosiglitazone \nRosiglitazone is a selective agonist at the PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) \nnuclear receptor and is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antihyperglycaemic agents.  It \nreduces glycaemia by reducing insulin resistance at adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. \n \nThe antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has been demonstrated in a number of animal models \nof type 2 diabetes.  In addition, rosiglitazone preserved ß-cell function as shown by increased \npancreatic islet mass and insulin content and prevented the development of overt hyperglycaemia in \nanimal models of type 2 diabetes.  Rosiglitazone did not stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion or \ninduce hypoglycaemia in rats and mice.  The major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) with high \naffinity to the soluble human PPARγ, exhibited relatively high potency in a glucose tolerance assay in \nobese mice.  The clinical relevance of this observation has not been fully elucidated. \n \nIn clinical trials, the glucose lowering effects observed with rosiglitazone are gradual in onset with \nnear maximal reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) evident following approximately 8 weeks of \ntherapy.  The improved glycaemic control is associated with reductions in both fasting and post-\nprandial glucose. \n \nRosiglitazone was associated with increases in weight.  In mechanistic studies, the weight increase was \npredominantly shown to be due to increased subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral and intra-hepatic \nfat. \n \nConsistent with the mechanism of action, rosiglitazone in combination with metformin reduced insulin \nresistance and improved pancreatic ß-cell function.  Improved glycaemic control was also associated \nwith significant decreases in free fatty acids.  As a consequence of different but complementary \nmechanisms of action, combination therapy of rosiglitazone with metformin resulted in additive \neffects on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. \n \nIn studies with a maximal duration of three years, rosiglitazone given once or twice daily in dual oral \ntherapy with metformin produced a sustained improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c).  A \nmore pronounced glucose-lowering effect was observed in obese patients.  An outcome study has not \nbeen completed with rosiglitazone, therefore the long-term benefits associated with improved \nglycaemic control of rosiglitazone have not been demonstrated. \n \nAn active controlled clinical trial (rosiglitazone up to 8 mg daily or metformin up to 2,000 mg daily) \nof 24 weeks duration was performed in 197 children (10-17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. \nImprovement in HbA1c from baseline achieved statistical significance only in the metformin group. \nRosiglitazone failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to metformin. Following rosiglitazone treatment, \nthere were no new safety concerns noted in children compared to adult patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. No long-term efficacy and safety data are available in paediatric patients. \n \nADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) was a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial with \na treatment duration of 4-6 years (median duration of 4 years), in which rosiglitazone at doses of 4 to \n8 mg/day was compared to metformin (500 mg to 2000 mg/day) and glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/day) \nin 4351 drug naive subjects recently diagnosed (≤3 years) with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone \ntreatment significantly reduced the risk of reaching monotherapy failure (FPG>10.0 mmol/L) by 63% \nrelative to glibenclamide (HR 0.37, CI 0.30-0.45) and by 32% relative to metformin (HR 0.68, \nCI 0.55-0.85) during the course of the study (up to 72 months of treatment). This translates to a \ncumulative incidence of treatment failure of 10.3% for rosiglitazone, 14.8% for metformin and 23.3% \nfor glibenclamide treated patients. Overall, 43%, 47% and 42% of subjects in the rosiglitazone, \nglibenclamide and metformin groups respectively withdrew due to reasons other than monotherapy \nfailure. The impact of these findings on disease progression or on microvascular or macrovascular \noutcomes has not been determined (see section 4.8). In this study, the adverse events observed were \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n14 \n\nconsistent with the known adverse event profile for each of the treatments, including continuing \nweight gain with rosiglitazone. An additional observation of an increased incidence of bone fractures \nwas seen in women with rosiglitazone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of glycaemia in \nDiabetes) trial was a large (4,447 subjects), open-label, prospective, controlled study (mean follow-up \n5.5 years) in which patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin or \nsulphonylurea were randomised to add-on rosiglitazone or metformin or sulphonylurea. The mean \nduration of diabetes in these patients was approximately 7 years. The adjudicated primary endpoint \nwas cardiovascular hospitalisation (which included hospitalisations for heart failure) or cardiovascular \ndeath. Mean doses at the end of randomised treatment are shown in the following table: \n \nRandomised Treatment† Mean (SD) dose at end of randomised treatment \nRosiglitazone (either SU or metformin) 6.7 (1.9) mg \nSulphonylurea (background metformin)  \n\nGlimepiride* 3.6 (1.8) mg \nMetformin (background sulphonylurea) 1995.5 (682.6) mg \n*Similar relative effective doses (i.e approximately half maximal dose) for other sulphonylureas \n(glibenclamide and glicazide). \n† Patients who took designated treatment as randomised in combination with the correct background \ntreatment and with evaluable data. \n \nNo difference in the number of adjudicated primary endpoint events for rosiglitazone (321/2220) \nversus active control (323/2227) (HR 0.99, CI 0.85-1.16) was observed, meeting the pre-defined non-\ninferiority criterion of 1.20 (non-inferiority p = 0.02). HR and CI for key secondary endpoints were: \nall-cause death (HR 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08), MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - cardiovascular \ndeath, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) (HR 0.93, CI 0.74-1.15), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, CI \n0.59-1.18), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.14, CI 0.80-1.63) and stroke (HR 0.72, CI 0.49-1.06). In \na sub-study at 18 months, add-on rosiglitazone dual therapy was non-inferior to the combination of \nsulphonylurea plus metformin for lowering HbA1c. In the final analysis at 5 years, an adjusted mean \nreduction from baseline in HbA1c of 0.14% for patients on rosiglitazone added to metformin versus an \nincrease of 0.17% for patients taking sulphonylurea added to metformin was seen during treatment \nwith randomised dual-combination therapy (p<0.0001 for treatment difference). An adjusted mean \nreduction in HbA1c of 0.24% was seen for patients taking rosiglitazone added to sulphonylurea, \nversus a reduction in HbA1c of 0.10% for patients taking metformin added to sulphonylurea, \n(p=0.0083 for treatment difference). There was a significant increase in heart failure (fatal and non-\nfatal) (HR 2.10, CI 1.35-3.27) and bone fractures (Risk Ratio 1.57, CI 1.26-1.97) in rosiglitazone-\ncontaining treatments compared to active control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A total of 564 patients \nwithdrew from cardiovascular follow-up, which accounted for 12.3% of rosiglitazone patients and \n13% of control patients; representing 7.2% of patient-years lost for cardiovascular events follow-up \nand 2.0% of patient-years lost for all cause mortality follow-up. \n \nMetformin \nMetformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose.  It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetformin may act via three mechanisms:  \n- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, \n- in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and \n\nutilisation, \n- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption. \n \nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase.   \nMetformin increases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters \n(GLUT-1 and GLUT-4). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n15 \n\nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \nmetabolism.  This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term \nclinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDLc and triglyceride levels. \n \nThe prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood \nglucose control in type 2 diabetes.  Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed: \n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \n\ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of diabetes-related mortality: metformin \n7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin 13.5 events/1,000 \npatient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.011), and versus the \ncombined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/1,000 patient-years \n(p=0.021) \n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin 11 events/1,000 \npatient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.01). \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAVANDAMET \nAbsorption \nNo statistically significant difference was observed between the absorption characteristics of \nrosiglitazone and metformin from the AVANDAMET tablet and those obtained from rosiglitazone \nmaleate and metformin hydrochloride tablets, respectively. \n \nFood had no effect on the AUC of rosiglitazone or metformin when AVANDAMET was administered \nto healthy volunteers.  In the fed state, Cmax was lower (22% rosiglitazone and 15% metformin) and \ntmax delayed (by approximately 1.5 h rosiglitazone and 0.5 h metformin).  This food-effect is not \nconsidered clinically significant. \n \nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nAVANDAMET. \n \nRosiglitazone \nAbsorption \nAbsolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone following both a 4 and an 8 mg oral dose is approximately \n99%.  Rosiglitazone plasma concentrations peak at around 1 h after dosing.  Plasma concentrations are \napproximately dose proportional over the therapeutic dose range.  \nAdministration of rosiglitazone with food resulted in no change in overall exposure (AUC), although a \nsmall decrease in Cmax (approximately 20-28%) and a delay in tmax (approximately 1.75 h) were \nobserved compared to dosing in the fasting state.  These small changes are not clinically significant \nand, therefore, it is not necessary to administer rosiglitazone at any particular time in relation to meals.  \nThe absorption of rosiglitazone is not affected by increases in gastric pH. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution of rosiglitazone is approximately 14 l in healthy volunteers.  Plasma \nprotein binding of rosiglitazone is high (approximately 99.8%) and is not influenced by concentration \nor age.  The protein binding of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) is very high \n(> 99.99%). \n \nMetabolism \nMetabolism of rosiglitazone is extensive with no parent compound being excreted unchanged.  The \nmajor routes of metabolism are N-demethylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation with \nsulphate and glucuronic acid.

However, this raises no safety \nconcern regarding target or special populations as hepatic impairment is contraindicated and the phase \nIII clinical studies included a considerable number of elderly patients and patients with mild to \nmoderate renal impairment. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with a minor \ncontribution by CYP2C9. \n \nSince there is no significant in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A or 4A with \nrosiglitazone, there is a low probability of significant metabolism-based interactions with substances \nmetabolised by these P450 enzymes.  Rosiglitazone showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 \n(IC50 18 µM) and low inhibition of CYP2C9 (IC50 50 µM) in vitro (see section 4.5).  An in vivo \ninteraction study with warfarin indicated that rosiglitazone does not interact with CYP2C9 substrates \nin vivo. \n \nElimination \nTotal plasma clearance of rosiglitazone is around 3 l/h and the terminal elimination half-life of \nrosiglitazone is approximately 3-4 h.  There is no evidence for unexpected accumulation of \nrosiglitazone after once or twice daily dosing.  The major route of excretion is the urine with \napproximately two-thirds of the dose being eliminated by this route, whereas faecal elimination \naccounts for approximately 25% of dose.  No intact active substance is excreted in urine or faeces.  \nThe terminal half-life for radioactivity was about 130 h indicating that elimination of metabolites is \nvery slow.  Accumulation of the metabolites in plasma is expected upon repeated dosing, especially \nthat of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) for which an 8-fold accumulation is anticipated. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no marked differences in the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone between males and females. \n \nElderly: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was not found to influence the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone to any significant extent. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Population pharmacokinetic analysis including 96 paediatric patients aged \n10 to 18 years and weighing 35 to 178 kg suggested similar mean CL/F in children and adults. \nIndividual CL/F in the paediatric population was in the same range as individual adult data. CL/F \nseemed to be independent of age, but increased with weight in the paediatric population. \n \nHepatic impairment: In cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, unbound \nCmax and AUC were 2- and 3-fold higher than in normal subjects.  The inter-subject variability was \nlarge, with a 7-fold difference in unbound AUC between patients. \n \nRenal insufficiency: There are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of \nrosiglitazone in patients with renal impairment or end stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. \n \nMetformin \nAbsorption \nAfter an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 h.  Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg \nmetformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects.  After an oral dose, the non-absorbed \nfraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. \n \nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete.  It is assumed that the \npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear.  At the usual metformin doses and dosing \nschedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than \n1 µg/ml.  In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed \n4 µg/ml, even at maximum doses. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n17 \n\nFood decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin.  Following administration \nof a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC and a 35 min \nprolongation of time to peak plasma concentration was observed.  The clinical relevance of this \ndecrease is unknown. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding is negligible.  Metformin partitions into erythrocytes.  The blood peak is lower \nthan the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time.  The red blood cells most likely \nrepresent a secondary compartment of distribution.  The mean Vd ranged between 63 – 276 l. \n \nMetabolism \nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.  No metabolites have been identified in humans. \n \nElimination \nRenal clearance of metformin is > 400 ml/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration and tubular secretion.  Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is \napproximately 6.5 h.  When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to \nthat of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of \nmetformin in plasma. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in AVANDAMET.  The \nfollowing data are findings in studies performed with rosiglitazone or metformin individually. \n \nRosiglitazone \nUndesirable effects observed in animal studies with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \nAn increase in plasma volume accompanied by decrease in red cell parameters and increase in heart \nweight.  Increases in liver weight, plasma ALT (dog only) and fat tissue were also observed.  Similar \neffects have been seen with other thiazolidinediones. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of rosiglitazone to rats during mid-late gestation was \nassociated with foetal death and retarded foetal development.  In addition, rosiglitazone inhibited \novarian oestradiol and progesterone synthesis and lowered plasma levels of these hormones resulting \nin effects on oestrus/menstrual cycles and fertility (see section 4.4). \n \nIn an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with rosiglitazone at 200 \ntimes the pharmacologically active dose increased tumour multiplicity in the colon.  The relevance of \nthis finding is unknown.  However, rosiglitazone promoted differentiation and reversal of mutagenic \nchanges in human colon cancer cells in vitro.  In addition, rosiglitazone was not genotoxic in a battery \nof in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and there was no evidence of colon tumours in lifetime \nstudies of rosiglitazone in two rodent species. \n \nMetformin \nNon-clinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAVANDAMET 2 mg/500 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 2 mg of rosiglitazone (as rosiglitazone maleate) and 500 mg of metformin \nhydrochloride (corresponding to metformin free base 390 mg). \n \nExcipients: \nEach tablet contains lactose (approximately 11 mg) \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nPale pink film-coated tablets marked \"gsk\" on one side and \"2/500\" on the other. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAVANDAMET is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, particularly \noverweight patients: \n- who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of oral \n\nmetformin alone. \n- in triple oral therapy with sulphonylurea in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite \n\ndual oral therapy with their maximally tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe usual starting dose of AVANDAMET is 4 mg/day rosiglitazone plus 2000 mg/day metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nRosiglitazone can be increased to 8 mg/day after 8 weeks if greater glycaemic control is required. The \nmaximum recommended daily dose of AVANDAMET is 8 mg rosiglitazone plus 2000 mg metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nThe total daily dose of AVANDAMET should be given in two divided doses. \n \nDose titration with rosiglitazone (added to the optimal dose of metformin) may be considered before \nthe patient is switched to AVANDAMET. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate, direct change from metformin monotherapy to AVANDAMET may be \nconsidered. \n \nTaking AVANDAMET with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with \nmetformin. \n \nTriple oral therapy (rosiglitazone, metformin and sulphonylurea) (see section 4.4) \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n20 \n\n- Patients on metformin and sulphonylurea: when appropriate AVANDAMET may be initiated at \n4 mg/day rosiglitazone with the dose of metformin substituting that already being taken.  An \nincrease in the rosiglitazone component to 8 mg/day should be undertaken cautiously following \nappropriate clinical evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing adverse reactions \nrelating to fluid retention (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n- Patients established on triple oral therapy: when appropriate, AVANDAMET may substitute \nrosiglitazone and metformin doses already being taken. \n\n \nWhere appropriate, AVANDAMET may be used to substitute concomitant rosiglitazone and \nmetformin in existing dual or triple oral therapy to simplify treatment. \n \nElderly \nAs metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal \nfunction, elderly patients taking AVANDAMET should have their renal function monitored regularly \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nAVANDAMET should not be used in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction e.g. serum \ncreatinine levels > 135 μmol/l in males and > 110 μmol/l in females and/or creatinine clearance \n< 70 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAVANDAMET is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age as \nthere are no data available on its safety and efficacy in this age group (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nAVANDAMET is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n- hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone, metformin hydrochloride or to any of the excipients \n- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) stages I to \n\nIV) \n- an Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI) (see section 4.4) \n- acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as: \n\n- cardiac or respiratory failure \n- recent myocardial infarction \n- shock \n\n- hepatic impairment \n- acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see section 4.4) \n- diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma \n- renal failure or renal dysfunction e.g. serum creatinine levels > 135 µmol/l in males and \n\n> 110 µmol/l in females and/or creatinine clearance < 70 ml/min (see section 4.4) \n- acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: \n\n- dehydration \n- severe infection \n- shock \n- intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see section 4.4) \n- lactation. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLactic acidosis \nLactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin \naccumulation.  Reported cases of lactic acidosis in patients on metformin have occurred primarily in \ndiabetic patients with significant renal failure.  The incidence of lactic acidosis can and should be \nreduced by also assessing other associated risk factors such as poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n21 \n\nprolonged fasting, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency and any conditions associated with \nhypoxia. \n \nDiagnosis: \nLactic acidosis is characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain and hypothermia followed by \ncoma.  Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH, plasma lactate levels above 5 mmol/l \nand an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio.  If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment \nwith the medicinal product should be discontinued and the patient hospitalised immediately (see \nsection 4.9). \n \nRenal function \nAs metformin is excreted by the kidney, serum creatinine concentrations should be determined \nregularly: \n- at least once a year in patients with normal renal function \n- at least two to four times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at the upper limit of \n\nnormal and in elderly patients. \n \n\nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic.  Special caution should be \nexercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating \nantihypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with an NSAID. \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \nThiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention which may exacerbate or precipitate signs or symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone can cause dose-dependent fluid retention. The possible \ncontribution of fluid retention to weight gain should be individually assessed as rapid and excessive \nweight gain has been reported very rarely as a sign of fluid retention. All patients, particularly those \nreceiving concurrent insulin but also sulphonylurea therapy, those at risk for heart failure, and those \nwith reduced cardiac reserve, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions \nrelating to fluid retention, including weight gain and heart failure.  AVANDAMET must be \ndiscontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.   \n \nThe use of AVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin may be associated with \nincreased risks of fluid retention and heart failure (see section 4.8).  The decision to initiate \nAVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea should include consideration of alternative \ntherapies. Increased monitoring of the patient is recommended if AVANDAMET is used in \ncombination particularly with insulin but also with a sulphonylurea.   \n \nHeart failure was also reported more frequently in patients with a history of heart failure; oedema and \nheart failure was also reported more frequently in elderly patients and in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal failure. Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited \nexperience in this patient group. Since NSAIDs, insulin and rosiglitazone are all associated with fluid \nretention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. \n \nCombination with insulin \nAn increased incidence of cardiac failure has been observed in clinical trials when rosiglitazone is \nused in combination with insulin. Insulin and rosiglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema and could increase the risk of ischaemic \nheart disease. Insulin should only be added to established rosiglitazone therapy in exceptional cases \nand under close supervision. \n \nMyocardial Ischaemia \nA retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies indicated that treatment \nwith rosiglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischaemic events. However, \nin their entirety the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive (see section 4.8).  \nThere are limited clinical trial data in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or peripheral arterial \ndisease. Therefore, as a precaution, the use of rosiglitazone is not recommended in these patients, \nparticularly those with myocardial ischaemic symptoms. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n22 \n\n \nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) \nPatients experiencing an ACS have not been studied in rosiglitazone controlled clinical trials. In view \nof the potential for development of heart failure in these patients, rosiglitazone should therefore not be \ninitiated in patients having an acute coronary event and it should be discontinued during the acute \nphase (see section 4.3). \n \nMonitoring of liver function \nThere have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience with \nrosiglitazone (see section 4.8).  There is limited experience with rosiglitazone in patients with elevated \nliver enzymes (ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal).  Therefore, liver enzymes should be \nchecked prior to the initiation of therapy with AVANDAMET in all patients and periodically \nthereafter based on clinical judgement.  Therapy with AVANDAMET should not be initiated in \npatients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) or \nwith any other evidence of liver disease.  If ALT levels are increased to > 3 times the upper limit of \nnormal during AVANDAMET therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible.  \nIf ALT levels remain > 3 times the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued.  If any \npatient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked.  The \ndecision whether to continue the patient on therapy with AVANDAMET should be guided by clinical \njudgement pending laboratory evaluations.  If jaundice is observed, therapy should be discontinued. \n \nEye disorders \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween rosiglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate ophthalmologic referral should \nbe considered. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials with rosiglitazone there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, which was greater \nwhen used in combination with insulin. Therefore weight should be closely monitored, given that it \nmay be attributable to fluid retention, which may be associated with cardiac failure. \n \nAnaemia \nRosiglitazone treatment is associated with a dose-related reduction of haemoglobin levels.  In patients \nwith low haemoglobin levels before initiating therapy, there is an increased risk of anaemia during \ntreatment with AVANDAMET. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nPatients receiving AVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin may be at risk for \ndose-related hypoglycaemia. Increased monitoring of the patient and a reduction in the dose of the \nconcomitant agent may be necessary. \n \nSurgery \nAs AVANDAMET contains metformin hydrochloride, the treatment should be discontinued 48 hours \nbefore elective surgery with general anaesthesia and should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 \nhours afterwards. \n \nAdministration of iodinated contrast agent \nThe intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies can lead to renal \nfailure.  Therefore, due to the metformin active substance, AVANDAMET should be discontinued \nprior to, or at the time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal \nfunction has been re-evaluated and found to be normal (see section 4.5). \n \nBone disorders \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n23 \n\nLong-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fractures in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). The majority of the fractures have occurred in the upper \nlimbs and distal lower limbs. In females, this increased incidence was noted after the first year of \ntreatment and persisted during long-term treatment. The risk of fracture should be considered in the \ncare of patients, especially female patients, treated with rosiglitazone. \n \nOther precautions \nPremenopausal women have received rosiglitazone during clinical studies.  Although hormonal \nimbalance has been seen in preclinical studies (see section 5.3), no significant undesirable effects \nassociated with menstrual disorders have been observed.  As a consequence of improving insulin \nsensitivity, resumption of ovulation may occur in patients who are anovulatory due to insulin \nresistance.  Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nAVANDAMET should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C8 inhibitors \n(e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin), due to the effect on rosiglitazone pharmacokinetics \n(see section 4.5). Furthermore, AVANDAMET should be used with caution during concomitant \nadministration of cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. \ncimetidine) due to the effect on metformin pharmacokinetics (see section 4.5). Glycaemic control \nshould be monitored closely. AVANDAMET dose adjustment within the recommended posology or \nchanges in diabetic treatment should be considered. \n \nAll patients should continue their diet with regular distribution of carbohydrate intake during the day.  \nOverweight patients should continue their energy-restricted diet. \nThe usual laboratory tests for diabetes monitoring should be performed regularly. \n \nAVANDAMET tablets contain lactose and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere have been no formal interaction studies for AVANDAMET, however the concomitant use of the \nactive substances in patients in clinical studies and in widespread clinical use has not resulted in any \nunexpected interactions.  The following statements reflect the information available on the individual \nactive substances (rosiglitazone and metformin). \n \nThere is increased risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication (particularly in the case of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic insufficiency) due to the metformin active substance of \nAVANDAMET (see section 4.4).  Avoid consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing \nalcohol. \n \nCationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may \ninteract with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted \nin seven normal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, \nincreased metformin systemic exposure (AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%. Therefore, close monitoring \nof glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular \nsecretion are co-administered (see section 4.4). \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with \nCYP2C9 as only a minor pathway.  \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) resulted in a twofold \nincrease in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. Since there is a potential for an increase in the risk of \ndose-related adverse reactions, a decrease in rosiglitazone dose may be needed. Close monitoring of \nglycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n24 \n\nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) resulted in a 66% decrease \nin rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. It cannot be excluded that other inducers (e.g. phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort) may also affect rosiglitazone exposure. The \nrosiglitazone dose may need to be increased. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4). \n \nClinically significant interactions with CYP2C9 substrates or inhibitors are not anticipated. \n \nConcomitant administration of rosiglitazone with the oral antihyperglycaemic agents glibenclamide \nand acarbose did not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin, the CYP3A4 \nsubstrates nifedipine, ethinylestradiol or norethindrone were observed after co-administration with \nrosiglitazone. \n \nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to renal failure, resulting in \nmetformin accumulation and a risk of lactic acidosis.  Metformin should be discontinued prior to, or at \nthe time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards and only after renal function has been \nre-evaluated and found to be normal. \n \nCombination requiring precautions for use \nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes) beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity.  The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperformed, especially at the beginning of treatment.  If necessary, the dosage of the \nantihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal \nproduct and on its discontinuation. \nACE-inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels.  If necessary, the dosage of the \nantihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal \nproduct and on its discontinuation. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor AVANDAMET no preclinical or clinical data on exposed pregnancies or lactation are available. \n \nRosiglitazone has been reported to cross the human placenta and to be detectable in foetal tissues. \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rosiglitazone in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The potential risk for humans is unknown.   \n \nTherefore, AVANDAMET should not be used during pregnancy. If a patient wishes to become \npregnant or if pregnancy occurs, treatment with AVANDAMET should be discontinued unless the \nexpected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBoth rosiglitazone and metformin have been detected in the milk of experimental animals.  It is not \nknown whether breast-feeding will lead to exposure of the infant to the medicinal product.  \nAVANDAMET must therefore not be used in women who are breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAVANDAMET has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions are presented below for each of the component parts of AVANDAMET. An adverse \nreaction is only presented for the fixed dose combination if it has not been seen in one of the \ncomponent parts of AVANDAMET or if it occurred at a higher frequency than that listed for a \ncomponent part. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n25 \n\n \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics. Adverse reaction frequency categories \nassigned based on clinical trial experience may not reflect the frequency of adverse events occurring \nduring normal clinical practice. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to \n<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000) and very rare (<1/10,000 \nincluding isolated reports). \n \nAVANDAMET \n \nData from double-blind studies confirm that the safety profile of concomitant rosiglitazone and \nmetformin is similar to that of the combined adverse reaction profile for the two medicinal products. \nData with AVANDAMET is also consistent with this combined adverse reaction profile. \n \nClinical trial data (addition of insulin to established AVANDAMET therapy) \nIn a single study (n=322) where insulin was added to patients established on AVANDAMET, no new \nadverse events were observed in excess of those already defined for either AVANDAMET or \nrosiglitazone combination therapies. \nHowever, the risk of both fluid related adverse events and hypoglycaemia are increased when \nAVANDAMET is used in combination with insulin. \n \nRosiglitazone \n \nClinical trial data \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics.  \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified from an overview of clinical trials involving over 5,000 \nrosiglitazone-treated patients.

The elevated total cholesterol levels were associated with \nan increase in both LDLc and HDLc, but the ratio of total cholesterol: HDLc was unchanged or \nimproved in long term studies.  Overall, these increases were generally mild to moderate and usually \ndid not require discontinuation of treatment. \n \n2 An increased incidence of heart failure has been observed when rosiglitazone was added to treatment \nregimens with a sulphonylurea (either as dual or triple therapy), and appeared higher with 8 mg \nrosiglitazone compared to 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose). The incidence of heart failure on triple \noral therapy was 1.4% in the main double blind study, compared to 0.4% for metformin plus \nsulphonylurea dual therapy.  The incidence of heart failure in combination with insulin (rosiglitazone \nadded to established insulin therapy) was 2.4%, compared to insulin alone, 1.1%.   \n \nIn a placebo-controlled one-year trial in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, \nworsening or possible worsening of heart failure occurred in 6.4% of patients treated with \nrosiglitazone, compared with 3.5% on placebo. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n27 \n\n \n3 In a retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies, the overall incidence of \nevents typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was higher for rosiglitazone containing regimens, \n2.00% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 1.53% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% \nconfidence interval (CI) 1.004 - 1.69)]. This risk was increased when rosiglitazone was added to \nestablished insulin and in patients receiving nitrates for known ischaemic heart disease. In an update to \nthis retrospective analysis that included 10 further studies that met the criteria for inclusion, but were \nnot available at the time of the original analysis, the overall incidence of events typically associated \nwith cardiac ischaemia was not statistically different for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.21% \nversus combined active and placebo comparators, 2.08% [HR 1.098 (95% CI 0.809 - 1.354)]. In a \nprospective cardiovascular outcomes study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) the primary endpoint events of \ncardiovascular death or hospitalisation were similar between rosiglitazone and active comparators [HR \n0.99 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.16)]. Two other long-term prospective randomised controlled clinical trials \n(9,620 patients, study duration >3 years in each study), comparing rosiglitazone to some other \napproved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, have not confirmed or excluded the potential risk of \ncardiac ischaemia. In their entirety, the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are \ninconclusive. \n \n4 Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fracture in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone. In a monotherapy study, the incidence in females for rosiglitazone was \n9.3% (2.7 patients per 100 patient years) vs 5.1% (1.5 patients per 100 patient years) for metformin or \n3.5% (1.3 patients per 100 patient years) for glibenclamide. In another long-term study, there was an \nincreased incidence of bone fracture for subjects in the combined rosiglitazone group compared to \nactive control [8.3% vs 5.3%, Risk ratio 1.57 (95% CI 1.26 - 1.97)]. The risk of fracture appeared to \nbe higher in females relative to control [11.5% vs 6.3%, Risk ratio 1.82 (95% CI 1.37 - 2.41)], than in \nmales relative to control [5.3% vs 4.3%, Risk ratio 1.23 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.77)]. Additional data are \nnecessary to determine whether there is an increased risk of fracture in males after a longer period of \nfollow-up. The majority of the fractures were reported in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn double-blind clinical trials with rosiglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three \ntimes the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo (0.2%) and less than that of the active \ncomparators (0.5% metformin/sulphonylureas). The incidence of all adverse events relating to liver \nand biliary systems was <1.5% in any treatment group and similar to placebo. \n \nPost-marketing data  \nIn addition to the adverse reactions identified from clinical trial data, the adverse reactions presented \nin Table 2 have been identified in post approval use of rosiglitazone.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n28 \n\nTable 2.

In clinical studies in \nvolunteers rosiglitazone has been administered at single oral doses of up to 20 mg and was well \ntolerated. \n \nA large overdose of metformin (or coexisting risks of lactic acidosis) may lead to lactic acidosis which \nis a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital.  \n \nIn the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment is initiated as \ndictated by the patient's clinical status.  The most effective method to remove lactate and metformin is \nhaemodialysis, however rosiglitazone is highly protein bound and is not cleared by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering medicinal products, ATC \ncode: A10BD03 \n \nAVANDAMET combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complimentary mechanisms of action \nto improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: rosiglitazone maleate, a member of the \nthiazolidinedione class and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n30 \n\nThiazolidinediones act primarily by reducing insulin resistance and biguanides act primarily by \ndecreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.  \n \nRosiglitazone \nRosiglitazone is a selective agonist at the PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) \nnuclear receptor and is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antihyperglycaemic agents.  It \nreduces glycaemia by reducing insulin resistance at adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. \n \nThe antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has been demonstrated in a number of animal models \nof type 2 diabetes.  In addition, rosiglitazone preserved ß-cell function as shown by increased \npancreatic islet mass and insulin content and prevented the development of overt hyperglycaemia in \nanimal models of type 2 diabetes.  Rosiglitazone did not stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion or \ninduce hypoglycaemia in rats and mice.  The major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) with high \naffinity to the soluble human PPARγ, exhibited relatively high potency in a glucose tolerance assay in \nobese mice.  The clinical relevance of this observation has not been fully elucidated. \n \nIn clinical trials, the glucose lowering effects observed with rosiglitazone are gradual in onset with \nnear maximal reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) evident following approximately 8 weeks of \ntherapy.  The improved glycaemic control is associated with reductions in both fasting and post-\nprandial glucose. \n \nRosiglitazone was associated with increases in weight.  In mechanistic studies, the weight increase was \npredominantly shown to be due to increased subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral and intra-hepatic \nfat. \n \nConsistent with the mechanism of action, rosiglitazone in combination with metformin reduced insulin \nresistance and improved pancreatic ß-cell function.  Improved glycaemic control was also associated \nwith significant decreases in free fatty acids.  As a consequence of different but complementary \nmechanisms of action, combination therapy of rosiglitazone with metformin resulted in additive \neffects on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. \n \nIn studies with a maximal duration of three years, rosiglitazone given once or twice daily in dual oral \ntherapy with metformin produced a sustained improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c).  A \nmore pronounced glucose-lowering effect was observed in obese patients.  An outcome study has not \nbeen completed with rosiglitazone, therefore the long-term benefits associated with improved \nglycaemic control of rosiglitazone have not been demonstrated. \n \nAn active controlled clinical trial (rosiglitazone up to 8 mg daily or metformin up to 2,000 mg daily) \nof 24 weeks duration was performed in 197 children (10-17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. \nImprovement in HbA1c from baseline achieved statistical significance only in the metformin group. \nRosiglitazone failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to metformin. Following rosiglitazone treatment, \nthere were no new safety concerns noted in children compared to adult patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. No long-term efficacy and safety data are available in paediatric patients. \n \nADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) was a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial with \na treatment duration of 4-6 years (median duration of 4 years), in which rosiglitazone at doses of 4 to \n8 mg/day was compared to metformin (500 mg to 2000 mg/day) and glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/day) \nin 4351 drug naive subjects recently diagnosed (≤3 years) with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone \ntreatment significantly reduced the risk of reaching monotherapy failure (FPG>10.0 mmol/L) by 63% \nrelative to glibenclamide (HR 0.37, CI 0.30-0.45) and by 32% relative to metformin (HR 0.68, \nCI 0.55-0.85) during the course of the study (up to 72 months of treatment). This translates to a \ncumulative incidence of treatment failure of 10.3% for rosiglitazone, 14.8% for metformin and 23.3% \nfor glibenclamide treated patients. Overall, 43%, 47% and 42% of subjects in the rosiglitazone, \nglibenclamide and metformin groups respectively withdrew due to reasons other than monotherapy \nfailure. The impact of these findings on disease progression or on microvascular or macrovascular \noutcomes has not been determined (see section 4.8). In this study, the adverse events observed were \nconsistent with the known adverse event profile for each of the treatments, including continuing \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n31 \n\nweight gain with rosiglitazone. An additional observation of an increased incidence of bone fractures \nwas seen in women with rosiglitazone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of glycaemia in \nDiabetes) trial was a large (4,447 subjects), open-label, prospective, controlled study (mean follow-up \n5.5 years) in which patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin or \nsulphonylurea were randomised to add-on rosiglitazone or metformin or sulphonylurea. The mean \nduration of diabetes in these patients was approximately 7 years. The adjudicated primary endpoint \nwas cardiovascular hospitalisation (which included hospitalisations for heart failure) or cardiovascular \ndeath. Mean doses at the end of randomised treatment are shown in the following table: \n \nRandomised Treatment† Mean (SD) dose at end of randomised treatment \nRosiglitazone (either SU or metformin) 6.7 (1.9) mg \nSulphonylurea (background metformin)  \n\nGlimepiride* 3.6 (1.8) mg \nMetformin (background sulphonylurea) 1995.5 (682.6) mg \n*Similar relative effective doses (i.e approximately half maximal dose) for other sulphonylureas \n(glibenclamide and glicazide). \n† Patients who took designated treatment as randomised in combination with the correct background \ntreatment and with evaluable data. \n \nNo difference in the number of adjudicated primary endpoint events for rosiglitazone (321/2220) \nversus active control (323/2227) (HR 0.99, CI 0.85-1.16) was observed, meeting the pre-defined non-\ninferiority criterion of 1.20 (non-inferiority p = 0.02). HR and CI for key secondary endpoints were: \nall-cause death (HR 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08), MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - cardiovascular \ndeath, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) (HR 0.93, CI 0.74-1.15), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, CI \n0.59-1.18), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.14, CI 0.80-1.63) and stroke (HR 0.72, CI 0.49-1.06). In \na sub-study at 18 months, add-on rosiglitazone dual therapy was non-inferior to the combination of \nsulphonylurea plus metformin for lowering HbA1c. In the final analysis at 5 years, an adjusted mean \nreduction from baseline in HbA1c of 0.14% for patients on rosiglitazone added to metformin versus an \nincrease of 0.17% for patients taking sulphonylurea added to metformin was seen during treatment \nwith randomised dual-combination therapy (p<0.0001 for treatment difference). An adjusted mean \nreduction in HbA1c of 0.24% was seen for patients taking rosiglitazone added to sulphonylurea, \nversus a reduction in HbA1c of 0.10% for patients taking metformin added to sulphonylurea, \n(p=0.0083 for treatment difference). There was a significant increase in heart failure (fatal and non-\nfatal) (HR 2.10, CI 1.35-3.27) and bone fractures (Risk Ratio 1.57, CI 1.26-1.97) in rosiglitazone-\ncontaining treatments compared to active control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A total of 564 patients \nwithdrew from cardiovascular follow-up, which accounted for 12.3% of rosiglitazone patients and \n13% of control patients; representing 7.2% of patient-years lost for cardiovascular events follow-up \nand 2.0% of patient-years lost for all cause mortality follow-up. \n \nMetformin \nMetformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose.  It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetformin may act via three mechanisms:  \n- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis \n- in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and \n\nutilisation \n- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption. \n \nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase.   \nMetformin increases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters \n(GLUT-1 and GLUT-4). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n32 \n\nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \nmetabolism.  This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term \nclinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDLc and triglyceride levels. \n \nThe prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood \nglucose control in type 2 diabetes.  Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed: \n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \n\ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of diabetes-related mortality: metformin \n7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin 13.5 events/1,000 \npatient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.011), and versus the \ncombined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/1,000 patient-years \n(p=0.021) \n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin 11 events/1,000 \npatient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.01). \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAVANDAMET \nAbsorption \nNo statistically significant difference was observed between the absorption characteristics of \nrosiglitazone and metformin from the AVANDAMET tablet and those obtained from rosiglitazone \nmaleate and metformin hydrochloride tablets, respectively. \n \nFood had no effect on the AUC of rosiglitazone or metformin when AVANDAMET was administered \nto healthy volunteers.  In the fed state, Cmax was lower (22% rosiglitazone and 15% metformin) and \ntmax delayed (by approximately 1.5 h rosiglitazone and 0.5 h metformin).  This food-effect is not \nconsidered clinically significant. \n \nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nAVANDAMET. \n \nRosiglitazone \nAbsorption \nAbsolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone following both a 4 and an 8 mg oral dose is approximately \n99%.  Rosiglitazone plasma concentrations peak at around 1 h after dosing.  Plasma concentrations are \napproximately dose proportional over the therapeutic dose range.  \nAdministration of rosiglitazone with food resulted in no change in overall exposure (AUC), although a \nsmall decrease in Cmax (approximately 20-28%) and a delay in tmax (approximately 1.75 h) were \nobserved compared to dosing in the fasting state.  These small changes are not clinically significant \nand, therefore, it is not necessary to administer rosiglitazone at any particular time in relation to meals.  \nThe absorption of rosiglitazone is not affected by increases in gastric pH. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution of rosiglitazone is approximately 14 l in healthy volunteers.  Plasma \nprotein binding of rosiglitazone is high (approximately 99.8%) and is not influenced by concentration \nor age.  The protein binding of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) is very high \n(> 99.99%). \n \nMetabolism \nMetabolism of rosiglitazone is extensive with no parent compound being excreted unchanged.  The \nmajor routes of metabolism are N-demethylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation with \nsulphate and glucuronic acid.  The contribution of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n33 \n\nthe overall antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has not been fully elucidated in man and it \ncannot be ruled out that the metabolite may contribute to the activity.  However, this raises no safety \nconcern regarding target or special populations as hepatic impairment is contraindicated and the phase \nIII clinical studies included a considerable number of elderly patients and patients with mild to \nmoderate renal impairment. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with a minor \ncontribution by CYP2C9. \n \nSince there is no significant in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A or 4A with \nrosiglitazone, there is a low probability of significant metabolism-based interactions with substances \nmetabolised by these P450 enzymes.  Rosiglitazone showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 \n(IC50 18 µM) and low inhibition of CYP2C9 (IC50 50 µM) in vitro (see section 4.5).  An in vivo \ninteraction study with warfarin indicated that rosiglitazone does not interact with CYP2C9 substrates \nin vivo. \n \nElimination \nTotal plasma clearance of rosiglitazone is around 3 l/h and the terminal elimination half-life of \nrosiglitazone is approximately 3-4 h.  There is no evidence for unexpected accumulation of \nrosiglitazone after once or twice daily dosing.  The major route of excretion is the urine with \napproximately two-thirds of the dose being eliminated by this route, whereas faecal elimination \naccounts for approximately 25% of dose.  No intact active substance is excreted in urine or faeces.  \nThe terminal half-life for radioactivity was about 130 h indicating that elimination of metabolites is \nvery slow.  Accumulation of the metabolites in plasma is expected upon repeated dosing, especially \nthat of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) for which an 8-fold accumulation is anticipated. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no marked differences in the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone between males and females. \n \nElderly: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was not found to influence the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone to any significant extent. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Population pharmacokinetic analysis including 96 paediatric patients aged \n10 to 18 years and weighing 35 to 178 kg suggested similar mean CL/F in children and adults. \nIndividual CL/F in the paediatric population was in the same range as individual adult data. CL/F \nseemed to be independent of age, but increased with weight in the paediatric population. \n \nHepatic impairment: In cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, unbound \nCmax and AUC were 2- and 3-fold higher than in normal subjects.  The inter-subject variability was \nlarge, with a 7-fold difference in unbound AUC between patients. \n \nRenal insufficiency: There are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of \nrosiglitazone in patients with renal impairment or end stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. \n \nMetformin \nAbsorption \nAfter an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 h.  Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg \nmetformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects.  After an oral dose, the non-absorbed \nfraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. \n \nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete.  It is assumed that the \npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear.  At the usual metformin doses and dosing \nschedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than \n1 µg/ml.  In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed \n4 µg/ml, even at maximum doses. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n34 \n\nFood decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin.  Following administration \nof a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC and a 35 min \nprolongation of time to peak plasma concentration was observed.  The clinical relevance of this \ndecrease is unknown. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding is negligible.  Metformin partitions into erythrocytes.  The blood peak is lower \nthan the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time.  The red blood cells most likely \nrepresent a secondary compartment of distribution.  The mean Vd ranged between 63 – 276 l. \n \nMetabolism \nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.  No metabolites have been identified in humans. \n \nElimination \nRenal clearance of metformin is > 400 ml/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration and tubular secretion.  Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is \napproximately 6.5 h.  When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to \nthat of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of \nmetformin in plasma. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in AVANDAMET.  The \nfollowing data are findings in studies performed with rosiglitazone or metformin individually. \n \nRosiglitazone \nUndesirable effects observed in animal studies with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \nAn increase in plasma volume accompanied by decrease in red cell parameters and increase in heart \nweight.  Increases in liver weight, plasma ALT (dog only) and fat tissue were also observed.  Similar \neffects have been seen with other thiazolidinediones. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of rosiglitazone to rats during mid-late gestation was \nassociated with foetal death and retarded foetal development.  In addition, rosiglitazone inhibited \novarian oestradiol and progesterone synthesis and lowered plasma levels of these hormones resulting \nin effects on oestrus/menstrual cycles and fertility (see section 4.4). \n \nIn an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with rosiglitazone at 200 \ntimes the pharmacologically active dose increased tumour multiplicity in the colon.  The relevance of \nthis finding is unknown.  However, rosiglitazone promoted differentiation and reversal of mutagenic \nchanges in human colon cancer cells in vitro.  In addition, rosiglitazone was not genotoxic in a battery \nof in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and there was no evidence of colon tumours in lifetime \nstudies of rosiglitazone in two rodent species. \n \nMetformin \nNon-clinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAVANDAMET 2 mg/1000 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 2 mg of rosiglitazone (as rosiglitazone maleate) and 1000 mg of metformin \nhydrochloride (corresponding to metformin free base 780 mg). \n \nExcipients: \nEach tablet contains lactose (approximately 11 mg) \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nYellow film-coated tablets marked \"gsk\" on one side and \"2/1000\" on the other. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAVANDAMET is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, particularly \noverweight patients: \n- who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of oral \n\nmetformin alone. \n- in triple oral therapy with sulphonylurea in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite \n\ndual oral therapy with their maximally tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFor the different dosage regimens, AVANDAMET is available in appropriate strengths. \n \nThe usual starting dose of AVANDAMET is 4 mg/day rosiglitazone plus 2000 mg/day metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nRosiglitazone can be increased to 8 mg/day after 8 weeks if greater glycaemic control is required. The \nmaximum recommended daily dose of AVANDAMET is 8 mg rosiglitazone plus 2000 mg metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nThe total daily dose of AVANDAMET should be given in two divided doses. \n \nDose titration with rosiglitazone (added to the optimal dose of metformin) may be considered before \nthe patient is switched to AVANDAMET. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate, direct change from metformin monotherapy to AVANDAMET may be \nconsidered. \n \nTaking AVANDAMET with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with \nmetformin. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n38 \n\nTriple oral therapy (rosiglitazone, metformin and sulphonylurea) (see section 4.4) \n- Patients on metformin and sulphonylurea: when appropriate AVANDAMET may be initiated at \n\n4 mg/day rosiglitazone with the dose of metformin substituting that already being taken.  An \nincrease in the rosiglitazone component to 8 mg/day should be undertaken cautiously following \nappropriate clinical evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing adverse reactions \nrelating to fluid retention (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n- Patients established on triple oral therapy: when appropriate, AVANDAMET may substitute \nrosiglitazone and metformin doses already being taken. \n\n \nWhere appropriate, AVANDAMET may be used to substitute concomitant rosiglitazone and \nmetformin in existing dual or triple oral therapy to simplify treatment. \n \nElderly \nAs metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal \nfunction, elderly patients taking AVANDAMET should have their renal function monitored regularly \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nAVANDAMET should not be used in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction e.g. serum \ncreatinine levels > 135 μmol/l in males and > 110 μmol/l in females and/or creatinine clearance \n< 70 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAVANDAMET is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age as \nthere are no data available on its safety and efficacy in this age group (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nAVANDAMET is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n- hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone, metformin hydrochloride or to any of the excipients \n- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) stages I to \n\nIV) \n- an Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI) (see section 4.4) \n- acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as: \n\n- cardiac or respiratory failure \n- recent myocardial infarction \n- shock \n\n- hepatic impairment \n- acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see section 4.4) \n- diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma \n- renal failure or renal dysfunction e.g. serum creatinine levels > 135 µmol/l in males and \n\n> 110 µmol/l in females and/or creatinine clearance < 70 ml/min (see section 4.4) \n- acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: \n\n- dehydration \n- severe infection \n- shock \n- intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see section 4.4) \n\n- lactation. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLactic acidosis \nLactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin \naccumulation.  Reported cases of lactic acidosis in patients on metformin have occurred primarily in \ndiabetic patients with significant renal failure.  The incidence of lactic acidosis can and should be \nreduced by also assessing other associated risk factors such as poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n39 \n\nprolonged fasting, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency and any conditions associated with \nhypoxia. \n \nDiagnosis: \nLactic acidosis is characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain and hypothermia followed by \ncoma.  Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH, plasma lactate levels above 5 mmol/l \nand an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio.  If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment \nwith the medicinal product should be discontinued and the patient hospitalised immediately (see \nsection 4.9). \n \nRenal function \nAs metformin is excreted by the kidney, serum creatinine concentrations should be determined \nregularly: \n- at least once a year in patients with normal renal function \n- at least two to four times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at the upper limit of \n\nnormal and in elderly patients. \n \n\nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic.  Special caution should be \nexercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating \nantihypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with an NSAID. \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \nThiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention which may exacerbate or precipitate signs or symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone can cause dose-dependent fluid retention.  The possible \ncontribution of fluid retention to weight gain should be individually assessed as rapid and excessive \nweight gain has been reported very rarely as a sign of fluid retention. All patients, particularly those \nreceiving concurrent insulin but also sulphonylurea therapy, those at risk for heart failure, and those \nwith reduced cardiac reserve, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions \nrelating to fluid retention, including weight gain and heart failure.  AVANDAMET must be \ndiscontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.   \n \nThe use of AVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin may be associated with \nincreased risks of fluid retention and heart failure (see section 4.8).  The decision to initiate \nAVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea should include consideration of alternative \ntherapies. Increased monitoring of the patient is recommended if AVANDAMET is used in \ncombination particularly with insulin but also with a sulphonylurea. \n \nHeart failure was also reported more frequently in patients with a history of heart failure; oedema and \nheart failure was also reported more frequently in elderly patients and in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal failure. Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited \nexperience in this patient group. Since NSAIDs, insulin and rosiglitazone are all associated with fluid \nretention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. \n \nCombination with insulin \nAn increased incidence of cardiac failure has been observed in clinical trials when rosiglitazone is \nused in combination with insulin. Insulin and rosiglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema and could increase the risk of ischaemic \nheart disease. Insulin should only be added to established rosiglitazone therapy in exceptional cases \nand under close supervision. \n \nMyocardial Ischaemia \nA retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies indicated that treatment \nwith rosiglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischaemic events. However, \nin their entirety the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive (see section 4.8).  \nThere are limited clinical trial data in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or peripheral arterial \ndisease. Therefore, as a precaution, the use of rosiglitazone is not recommended in these patients, \nparticularly those with myocardial ischaemic symptoms. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n40 \n\n \nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) \nPatients experiencing an ACS have not been studied in rosiglitazone controlled clinical trials. In view \nof the potential for development of heart failure in these patients, rosiglitazone should therefore not be \ninitiated in patients having an acute coronary event and it should be discontinued during the acute \nphase (see section 4.3). \n \nMonitoring of liver function \nThere have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience with \nrosiglitazone (see section 4.8).  There is limited experience with rosiglitazone in patients with elevated \nliver enzymes (ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal).  Therefore, liver enzymes should be \nchecked prior to the initiation of therapy with AVANDAMET in all patients and periodically \nthereafter based on clinical judgement.  Therapy with AVANDAMET should not be initiated in \npatients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) or \nwith any other evidence of liver disease.  If ALT levels are increased to > 3 times the upper limit of \nnormal during AVANDAMET therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible.  \nIf ALT levels remain > 3 times the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued.  If any \npatient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked.  The \ndecision whether to continue the patient on therapy with AVANDAMET should be guided by clinical \njudgement pending laboratory evaluations.  If jaundice is observed, therapy should be discontinued. \n \nEye disorders \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween rosiglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate ophthalmologic referral should \nbe considered. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials with rosiglitazone there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, which was greater \nwhen used in combination with insulin. Therefore weight should be closely monitored, given that it \nmay be attributable to fluid retention, which may be associated with cardiac failure. \n \nAnaemia \nRosiglitazone treatment is associated with a dose-related reduction of haemoglobin levels.  In patients \nwith low haemoglobin levels before initiating therapy, there is an increased risk of anaemia during \ntreatment with AVANDAMET. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nPatients receiving AVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin may be at risk for \ndose-related hypoglycaemia. Increased monitoring of the patient and a reduction in the dose of the \nconcomitant agent may be necessary. \n \nSurgery \nAs AVANDAMET contains metformin hydrochloride, the treatment should be discontinued 48 hours \nbefore elective surgery with general anaesthesia and should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 \nhours afterwards. \n \nAdministration of iodinated contrast agent \nThe intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies can lead to renal \nfailure.  Therefore, due to the metformin active substance, AVANDAMET should be discontinued \nprior to, or at the time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal \nfunction has been re-evaluated and found to be normal (see section 4.5). \n \nBone disorders \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n41 \n\nLong-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fractures in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). The majority of the fractures have occurred in the upper \nlimbs and distal lower limbs. In females, this increased incidence was noted after the first year of \ntreatment and persisted during long-term treatment. The risk of fracture should be considered in the \ncare of patients, especially female patients, treated with rosiglitazone. \n \nOther precautions \nPremenopausal women have received rosiglitazone during clinical studies.  Although hormonal \nimbalance has been seen in preclinical studies (see section 5.3), no significant undesirable effects \nassociated with menstrual disorders have been observed.  As a consequence of improving insulin \nsensitivity, resumption of ovulation may occur in patients who are anovulatory due to insulin \nresistance.  Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nAVANDAMET should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C8 inhibitors \n(e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin), due to the effect on rosiglitazone pharmacokinetics \n(see section 4.5). Furthermore, AVANDAMET should be used with caution during concomitant \nadministration of cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. \ncimetidine) due to the effect on metformin pharmacokinetics (see section 4.5). Glycaemic control \nshould be monitored closely. AVANDAMET dose adjustment within the recommended posology or \nchanges in diabetic treatment should be considered. \n \nAll patients should continue their diet with regular distribution of carbohydrate intake during the day.  \nOverweight patients should continue their energy-restricted diet. \nThe usual laboratory tests for diabetes monitoring should be performed regularly. \n \nAVANDAMET tablets contain lactose and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere have been no formal interaction studies for AVANDAMET, however the concomitant use of the \nactive substances in patients in clinical studies and in widespread clinical use has not resulted in any \nunexpected interactions.  The following statements reflect the information available on the individual \nactive substances (rosiglitazone and metformin). \n \nThere is increased risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication (particularly in the case of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic insufficiency) due to the metformin active substance of \nAVANDAMET (see section 4.4).  Avoid consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing \nalcohol. \nCationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may \ninteract with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted \nin seven normal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, \nincreased metformin systemic exposure (AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%. Therefore, close monitoring \nof glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular \nsecretion are co-administered (see section 4.4). \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with \nCYP2C9 as only a minor pathway.  \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) resulted in a twofold \nincrease in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. Since there is a potential for an increase in the risk of \ndose-related adverse reactions, a decrease in rosiglitazone dose may be needed. Close monitoring of \nglycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n42 \n\nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) resulted in a 66% decrease \nin rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. It cannot be excluded that other inducers (e.g. phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort) may also affect rosiglitazone exposure. The \nrosiglitazone dose may need to be increased. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4). \n \nClinically significant interactions with CYP2C9 substrates or inhibitors are not anticipated. \n \nConcomitant administration of rosiglitazone with the oral antihyperglycaemic agents glibenclamide \nand acarbose did not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin, the CYP3A4 \nsubstrates nifedipine, ethinylestradiol or norethindrone were observed after co-administration with \nrosiglitazone. \n \nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to renal failure, resulting in \nmetformin accumulation and a risk of lactic acidosis.  Metformin should be discontinued prior to, or at \nthe time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards and only after renal function has been \nre-evaluated and found to be normal. \n \nCombination requiring precautions for use \nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes) beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity.  The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperformed, especially at the beginning of treatment.  If necessary, the dosage of the \nantihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal \nproduct and on its discontinuation. \nACE-inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels.  If necessary, the dosage of the \nantihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal \nproduct and on its discontinuation. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor AVANDAMET no preclinical or clinical data on exposed pregnancies or lactation are available. \n \nRosiglitazone has been reported to cross the human placenta and to be detectable in foetal tissues. \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rosiglitazone in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The potential risk for humans is unknown.   \n \nTherefore, AVANDAMET should not be used during pregnancy. If a patient wishes to become \npregnant or if pregnancy occurs, treatment with AVANDAMET should be discontinued unless the \nexpected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \nBoth rosiglitazone and metformin have been detected in the milk of experimental animals.  It is not \nknown whether breast-feeding will lead to exposure of the infant to the medicinal product.  \nAVANDAMET must therefore not be used in women who are breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAVANDAMET has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions are presented below for each of the component parts of AVANDAMET. An adverse \nreaction is only presented for the fixed dose combination if it has not been seen in one of the \ncomponent parts of AVANDAMET or if it occurred at a higher frequency than that listed for a \ncomponent part. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n43 \n\n \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics. Adverse reaction frequency categories \nassigned based on clinical trial experience may not reflect the frequency of adverse events occurring \nduring normal clinical practice. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to \n<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000) and very rare (<1/10,000 \nincluding isolated reports). \n \nAVANDAMET \n \nData from double-blind studies confirm that the safety profile of concomitant rosiglitazone and \nmetformin is similar to that of the combined adverse reaction profile for the two medicinal products. \nData with AVANDAMET is also consistent with this combined adverse reaction profile. \n \n \nClinical trial data (addition of insulin to established AVANDAMET therapy) \nIn a single study (n=322) where insulin was added to patients established on AVANDAMET, no new \nadverse events were observed in excess of those already defined for either AVANDAMET or \nrosiglitazone combination therapies. \n \nHowever, the risk of both fluid related adverse events and hypoglycaemia are increased when \nAVANDAMET is used in combination with insulin. \n \nRosiglitazone \n \nClinical trial data \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics.  \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified from an overview of clinical trials involving over 5,000 \nrosiglitazone-treated patients. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in the \ntable by decreasing frequency for the rosiglitazone monotherapy treatment regimen. Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n44 \n\nTable 1.

The elevated total cholesterol levels were associated with \nan increase in both LDLc and HDLc, but the ratio of total cholesterol: HDLc was unchanged or \nimproved in long term studies.  Overall, these increases were generally mild to moderate and usually \ndid not require discontinuation of treatment. \n \n2  An increased incidence of heart failure has been observed when rosiglitazone was added to treatment \nregimens with a sulphonylurea (either as dual or triple therapy), and appeared higher with 8 mg \nrosiglitazone compared to 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose).  The incidence of heart failure on \ntriple oral therapy was 1.4% in the main double blind study, compared to 0.4% for metformin plus \nsulphonylurea dual therapy.  The incidence of heart failure in combination with insulin (rosiglitazone \nadded to established insulin therapy) was 2.4%, compared to insulin alone, 1.1%.   \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n45 \n\nIn a placebo-controlled one-year trial in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, \nworsening or possible worsening of heart failure occurred in 6.4% of patients treated with \nrosiglitazone, compared with 3.5% on placebo. \n \n3 In a retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies, the overall incidence of \nevents typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was higher for rosiglitazone containing regimens, \n2.00% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 1.53% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% \nconfidence interval (CI) 1.004 - 1.69)]. This risk was increased when rosiglitazone was added to \nestablished insulin and in patients receiving nitrates for known ischaemic heart disease. In an update to \nthis retrospective analysis that included 10 further studies that met the criteria for inclusion, but were \nnot available at the time of the original analysis, the overall incidence of events typically associated \nwith cardiac ischaemia was not statistically different for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.21% \nversus combined active and placebo comparators, 2.08% [HR 1.098 (95% CI 0.809 - 1.354)]. In a \nprospective cardiovascular outcomes study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) the primary endpoint events of \ncardiovascular death or hospitalisation were similar between rosiglitazone and active comparators [HR \n0.99 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.16)]. Two other long-term prospective randomised controlled clinical trials \n(9,620 patients, study duration >3 years in each study), comparing rosiglitazone to some other \napproved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, have not confirmed or excluded the potential risk of \ncardiac ischaemia. In their entirety, the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are \ninconclusive. \n\n \n4 Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fracture in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone. In a monotherapy study, the incidence in females for rosiglitazone was \n9.3% (2.7 patients per 100 patient years) vs 5.1% (1.5 patients per 100 patient years) for metformin or \n3.5% (1.3 patients per 100 patient years) for glibenclamide. In another long-term study, there was an \nincreased incidence of bone fracture for subjects in the combined rosiglitazone group compared to \nactive control [8.3% vs 5.3%, Risk ratio 1.57 (95% CI 1.26 - 1.97)]. The risk of fracture appeared to \nbe higher in females relative to control [11.5% vs 6.3%, Risk ratio 1.82 (95% CI 1.37 - 2.41)], than in \nmales relative to control [5.3% vs 4.3%, Risk ratio 1.23 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.77)]. Additional data are \nnecessary to determine whether there is an increased risk of fracture in males after a longer period of \nfollow-up. The majority of the fractures were reported in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn double-blind clinical trials with rosiglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three \ntimes the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo (0.2%) and less than that of the active \ncomparators (0.5% metformin/sulphonylureas). The incidence of all adverse events relating to liver \nand biliary systems was <1.5% in any treatment group and similar to placebo. \n \nPost-marketing data  \nIn addition to the adverse reactions identified from clinical trial data, the adverse reactions presented \nin Table 2 have been identified in post approval use of rosiglitazone.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n46 \n\nTable 2.

In clinical studies in \nvolunteers rosiglitazone has been administered at single oral doses of up to 20 mg and was well \ntolerated. \n \nA large overdose of metformin (or coexisting risks of lactic acidosis) may lead to lactic acidosis which \nis a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital.  \n \nIn the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment is initiated as \ndictated by the patient's clinical status.  The most effective method to remove lactate and metformin is \nhaemodialysis, however rosiglitazone is highly protein bound and is not cleared by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering medicinal products, ATC \ncode: A10BD03 \n \nAVANDAMET combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complimentary mechanisms of action \nto improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: rosiglitazone maleate, a member of the \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n48 \n\nthiazolidinedione class and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.  \nThiazolidinediones act primarily by reducing insulin resistance and biguanides act primarily by \ndecreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.  \n \nRosiglitazone \nRosiglitazone is a selective agonist at the PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) \nnuclear receptor and is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antihyperglycaemic agents.  It \nreduces glycaemia by reducing insulin resistance at adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. \n \nThe antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has been demonstrated in a number of animal models \nof type 2 diabetes.  In addition, rosiglitazone preserved ß-cell function as shown by increased \npancreatic islet mass and insulin content and prevented the development of overt hyperglycaemia in \nanimal models of type 2 diabetes.  Rosiglitazone did not stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion or \ninduce hypoglycaemia in rats and mice.  The major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) with high \naffinity to the soluble human PPARγ, exhibited relatively high potency in a glucose tolerance assay in \nobese mice.  The clinical relevance of this observation has not been fully elucidated. \n \nIn clinical trials, the glucose lowering effects observed with rosiglitazone are gradual in onset with \nnear maximal reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) evident following approximately 8 weeks of \ntherapy.  The improved glycaemic control is associated with reductions in both fasting and post-\nprandial glucose. \n \nRosiglitazone was associated with increases in weight.  In mechanistic studies, the weight increase was \npredominantly shown to be due to increased subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral and intra-hepatic \nfat. \n \nConsistent with the mechanism of action, rosiglitazone in combination with metformin reduced insulin \nresistance and improved pancreatic ß-cell function.  Improved glycaemic control was also associated \nwith significant decreases in free fatty acids.  As a consequence of different but complementary \nmechanisms of action, combination therapy of rosiglitazone with metformin resulted in additive \neffects on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. \n \nIn studies with a maximal duration of three years, rosiglitazone given once or twice daily in dual oral \ntherapy with metformin produced a sustained improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c).  A \nmore pronounced glucose-lowering effect was observed in obese patients.  An outcome study has not \nbeen completed with rosiglitazone, therefore the long-term benefits associated with improved \nglycaemic control of rosiglitazone have not been demonstrated. \n \nAn active controlled clinical trial (rosiglitazone up to 8 mg daily or metformin up to 2,000 mg daily) \nof 24 weeks duration was performed in 197 children (10-17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. \nImprovement in HbA1c from baseline achieved statistical significance only in the metformin group. \nRosiglitazone failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to metformin. Following rosiglitazone treatment, \nthere were no new safety concerns noted in children compared to adult patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. No long-term efficacy and safety data are available in paediatric patients. \n \nADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) was a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial with \na treatment duration of 4-6 years (median duration of 4 years), in which rosiglitazone at doses of 4 to \n8 mg/day was compared to metformin (500 mg to 2000 mg/day) and glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/day) \nin 4351 drug naive subjects recently diagnosed (≤3 years) with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone \ntreatment significantly reduced the risk of reaching monotherapy failure (FPG>10.0 mmol/L) by 63% \nrelative to glibenclamide (HR 0.37, CI 0.30-0.45) and by 32% relative to metformin (HR 0.68, \nCI 0.55-0.85) during the course of the study (up to 72 months of treatment). This translates to a \ncumulative incidence of treatment failure of 10.3% for rosiglitazone, 14.8% for metformin and 23.3% \nfor glibenclamide treated patients. Overall, 43%, 47% and 42% of subjects in the rosiglitazone, \nglibenclamide and metformin groups respectively withdrew due to reasons other than monotherapy \nfailure. The impact of these findings on disease progression or on microvascular or macrovascular \noutcomes has not been determined (see section 4.8). In this study, the adverse events observed were \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n49 \n\nconsistent with the known adverse event profile for each of the treatments, including continuing \nweight gain with rosiglitazone. An additional observation of an increased incidence of bone fractures \nwas seen in women with rosiglitazone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of glycaemia in \nDiabetes) trial was a large (4,447 subjects), open-label, prospective, controlled study (mean follow-up \n5.5 years) in which patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin or \nsulphonylurea were randomised to add-on rosiglitazone or metformin or sulphonylurea. The mean \nduration of diabetes in these patients was approximately 7 years. The adjudicated primary endpoint \nwas cardiovascular hospitalisation (which included hospitalisations for heart failure) or cardiovascular \ndeath. Mean doses at the end of randomised treatment are shown in the following table: \n \nRandomised Treatment† Mean (SD) dose at end of randomised treatment \nRosiglitazone (either SU or metformin) 6.7 (1.9) mg \nSulphonylurea (background metformin)  \n\nGlimepiride* 3.6 (1.8) mg \nMetformin (background sulphonylurea) 1995.5 (682.6) mg \n*Similar relative effective doses (i.e approximately half maximal dose) for other sulphonylureas \n(glibenclamide and glicazide). \n† Patients who took designated treatment as randomised in combination with the correct background \ntreatment and with evaluable data. \n \nNo difference in the number of adjudicated primary endpoint events for rosiglitazone (321/2220) \nversus active control (323/2227) (HR 0.99, CI 0.85-1.16) was observed, meeting the pre-defined non-\ninferiority criterion of 1.20 (non-inferiority p = 0.02). HR and CI for key secondary endpoints were: \nall-cause death (HR 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08), MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - cardiovascular \ndeath, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) (HR 0.93, CI 0.74-1.15), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, CI \n0.59-1.18), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.14, CI 0.80-1.63) and stroke (HR 0.72, CI 0.49-1.06). In \na sub-study at 18 months, add-on rosiglitazone dual therapy was non-inferior to the combination of \nsulphonylurea plus metformin for lowering HbA1c. In the final analysis at 5 years, an adjusted mean \nreduction from baseline in HbA1c of 0.14% for patients on rosiglitazone added to metformin versus an \nincrease of 0.17% for patients taking sulphonylurea added to metformin was seen during treatment \nwith randomised dual-combination therapy (p<0.0001 for treatment difference). An adjusted mean \nreduction in HbA1c of 0.24% was seen for patients taking rosiglitazone added to sulphonylurea, \nversus a reduction in HbA1c of 0.10% for patients taking metformin added to sulphonylurea, \n(p=0.0083 for treatment difference). There was a significant increase in heart failure (fatal and non-\nfatal) (HR 2.10, CI 1.35-3.27) and bone fractures (Risk Ratio 1.57, CI 1.26-1.97) in rosiglitazone-\ncontaining treatments compared to active control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A total of 564 patients \nwithdrew from cardiovascular follow-up, which accounted for 12.3% of rosiglitazone patients and \n13% of control patients; representing 7.2% of patient-years lost for cardiovascular events follow-up \nand 2.0% of patient-years lost for all cause mortality follow-up. \n \nMetformin \nMetformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose.  It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetformin may act via three mechanisms:  \n- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis \n- in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and \n\nutilisation \n- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption. \n \nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase.   \nMetformin increases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters \n(GLUT-1 and GLUT-4). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n50 \n\nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \nmetabolism.  This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term \nclinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDLc and triglyceride levels. \n \nThe prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood \nglucose control in type 2 diabetes.  Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed: \n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \n\ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of diabetes-related mortality: metformin \n7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin 13.5 events/1,000 \npatient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.011), and versus the \ncombined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/1,000 patient-years \n(p=0.021) \n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin 11 events/1,000 \npatient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.01). \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAVANDAMET \nAbsorption \nNo statistically significant difference was observed between the absorption characteristics of \nrosiglitazone and metformin from the AVANDAMET tablet and those obtained from rosiglitazone \nmaleate and metformin hydrochloride tablets, respectively. \n \nFood had no effect on the AUC of rosiglitazone or metformin when AVANDAMET was administered \nto healthy volunteers.  In the fed state, Cmax was lower (22% rosiglitazone and 15% metformin) and \ntmax delayed (by approximately 1.5 h rosiglitazone and 0.5 h metformin).  This food-effect is not \nconsidered clinically significant. \n \nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nAVANDAMET. \n \nRosiglitazone \nAbsorption \nAbsolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone following both a 4 and an 8 mg oral dose is approximately \n99%.  Rosiglitazone plasma concentrations peak at around 1 h after dosing.  Plasma concentrations are \napproximately dose proportional over the therapeutic dose range.  \nAdministration of rosiglitazone with food resulted in no change in overall exposure (AUC), although a \nsmall decrease in Cmax (approximately 20-28%) and a delay in tmax (approximately 1.75 h) were \nobserved compared to dosing in the fasting state.  These small changes are not clinically significant \nand, therefore, it is not necessary to administer rosiglitazone at any particular time in relation to meals.  \nThe absorption of rosiglitazone is not affected by increases in gastric pH. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution of rosiglitazone is approximately 14 l in healthy volunteers.  Plasma \nprotein binding of rosiglitazone is high (approximately 99.8%) and is not influenced by concentration \nor age.  The protein binding of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) is very high \n(> 99.99%). \n \nMetabolism \nMetabolism of rosiglitazone is extensive with no parent compound being excreted unchanged.  The \nmajor routes of metabolism are N-demethylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation with \nsulphate and glucuronic acid.  The contribution of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n51 \n\nthe overall antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has not been fully elucidated in man and it \ncannot be ruled out that the metabolite may contribute to the activity.  However, this raises no safety \nconcern regarding target or special populations as hepatic impairment is contraindicated and the phase \nIII clinical studies included a considerable number of elderly patients and patients with mild to \nmoderate renal impairment. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with a minor \ncontribution by CYP2C9. \n \nSince there is no significant in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A or 4A with \nrosiglitazone, there is a low probability of significant metabolism-based interactions with substances \nmetabolised by these P450 enzymes.  Rosiglitazone showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 \n(IC50 18 µM) and low inhibition of CYP2C9 (IC50 50 µM) in vitro (see section 4.5).  An in vivo \ninteraction study with warfarin indicated that rosiglitazone does not interact with CYP2C9 substrates \nin vivo. \n \nElimination \nTotal plasma clearance of rosiglitazone is around 3 l/h and the terminal elimination half-life of \nrosiglitazone is approximately 3-4 h.  There is no evidence for unexpected accumulation of \nrosiglitazone after once or twice daily dosing.  The major route of excretion is the urine with \napproximately two-thirds of the dose being eliminated by this route, whereas faecal elimination \naccounts for approximately 25% of dose.  No intact active substance is excreted in urine or faeces.  \nThe terminal half-life for radioactivity was about 130 h indicating that elimination of metabolites is \nvery slow.  Accumulation of the metabolites in plasma is expected upon repeated dosing, especially \nthat of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) for which an 8-fold accumulation is anticipated. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no marked differences in the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone between males and females. \n \nElderly: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was not found to influence the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone to any significant extent. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Population pharmacokinetic analysis including 96 paediatric patients aged \n10 to 18 years and weighing 35 to 178 kg suggested similar mean CL/F in children and adults. \nIndividual CL/F in the paediatric population was in the same range as individual adult data. CL/F \nseemed to be independent of age, but increased with weight in the paediatric population. \n \nHepatic impairment: In cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, unbound \nCmax and AUC were 2- and 3-fold higher than in normal subjects.  The inter-subject variability was \nlarge, with a 7-fold difference in unbound AUC between patients. \n \nRenal insufficiency: There are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of \nrosiglitazone in patients with renal impairment or end stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. \n \nMetformin \nAbsorption \nAfter an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 h.  Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg \nmetformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects.  After an oral dose, the non-absorbed \nfraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. \n \nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete.  It is assumed that the \npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear.  At the usual metformin doses and dosing \nschedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than \n1 µg/ml.  In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed \n4 µg/ml, even at maximum doses. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n52 \n\nFood decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin.  Following administration \nof a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC and a 35 min \nprolongation of time to peak plasma concentration was observed.  The clinical relevance of this \ndecrease is unknown. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding is negligible.  Metformin partitions into erythrocytes.  The blood peak is lower \nthan the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time.  The red blood cells most likely \nrepresent a secondary compartment of distribution.  The mean Vd ranged between 63 – 276 l. \n \nMetabolism \nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.  No metabolites have been identified in humans. \n \nElimination \nRenal clearance of metformin is > 400 ml/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration and tubular secretion.  Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is \napproximately 6.5 h.  When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to \nthat of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of \nmetformin in plasma. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in AVANDAMET.  The \nfollowing data are findings in studies performed with rosiglitazone or metformin individually. \n \nRosiglitazone \nUndesirable effects observed in animal studies with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \nAn increase in plasma volume accompanied by decrease in red cell parameters and increase in heart \nweight.  Increases in liver weight, plasma ALT (dog only) and fat tissue were also observed.  Similar \neffects have been seen with other thiazolidinediones. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of rosiglitazone to rats during mid-late gestation was \nassociated with foetal death and retarded foetal development.  In addition, rosiglitazone inhibited \novarian oestradiol and progesterone synthesis and lowered plasma levels of these hormones resulting \nin effects on oestrus/menstrual cycles and fertility (see section 4.4). \n \nIn an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with rosiglitazone at 200 \ntimes the pharmacologically active dose increased tumour multiplicity in the colon.  The relevance of \nthis finding is unknown.  However, rosiglitazone promoted differentiation and reversal of mutagenic \nchanges in human colon cancer cells in vitro.  In addition, rosiglitazone was not genotoxic in a battery \nof in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and there was no evidence of colon tumours in lifetime \nstudies of rosiglitazone in two rodent species. \n \nMetformin \nNon-clinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAVANDAMET is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, particularly \noverweight patients: \n- who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of oral \n\nmetformin alone. \n- in triple oral therapy with sulphonylurea in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite \n\ndual oral therapy with their maximally tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFor the different dosage regimens, AVANDAMET is available in appropriate strengths. \n \nThe usual starting dose of AVANDAMET is 4 mg/day rosiglitazone plus 2000 mg/day metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nRosiglitazone can be increased to 8 mg/day after 8 weeks if greater glycaemic control is required. The \nmaximum recommended daily dose of AVANDAMET is 8 mg rosiglitazone plus 2000 mg metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nThe total daily dose of AVANDAMET should be given in two divided doses. \n \nDose titration with rosiglitazone (added to the optimal dose of metformin) may be considered before \nthe patient is switched to AVANDAMET. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate, direct change from metformin monotherapy to AVANDAMET may be \nconsidered. \n \nTaking AVANDAMET with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with \nmetformin. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n56 \n\nTriple oral therapy (rosiglitazone, metformin and sulphonylurea) (see section 4.4) \n- Patients on metformin and sulphonylurea: when appropriate AVANDAMET may be initiated at \n\n4 mg/day rosiglitazone with the dose of metformin substituting that already being taken.  An \nincrease in the rosiglitazone component to 8 mg/day should be undertaken cautiously following \nappropriate clinical evaluation to assess the patient's risk of developing adverse reactions \nrelating to fluid retention (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n- Patients established on triple oral therapy: when appropriate, AVANDAMET may substitute \nrosiglitazone and metformin doses already being taken. \n\n \nWhere appropriate, AVANDAMET may be used to substitute concomitant rosiglitazone and \nmetformin in existing dual or triple oral therapy to simplify treatment. \n \nElderly \nAs metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal \nfunction, elderly patients taking AVANDAMET should have their renal function monitored regularly \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nAVANDAMET should not be used in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction e.g. serum \ncreatinine levels > 135 μmol/l in males and > 110 μmol/l in females and/or creatinine clearance \n< 70 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAVANDAMET is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age as \nthere are no data available on its safety and efficacy in this age group (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nAVANDAMET is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n- hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone, metformin hydrochloride or to any of the excipients \n- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) stages I to \n\nIV) \n- an Acute Coronary Syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI) (see section 4.4) \n- acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as: \n\n- cardiac or respiratory failure \n- recent myocardial infarction \n- shock \n\n- hepatic impairment \n- acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see section 4.4) \n- diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma \n- renal failure or renal dysfunction e.g. serum creatinine levels > 135 µmol/l in males and \n\n> 110 µmol/l in females and/or creatinine clearance < 70 ml/min (see section 4.4) \n- acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: \n\n- dehydration \n- severe infection \n- shock \n- intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see section 4.4) \n\n- lactation. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLactic acidosis \nLactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin \naccumulation.  Reported cases of lactic acidosis in patients on metformin have occurred primarily in \ndiabetic patients with significant renal failure.  The incidence of lactic acidosis can and should be \nreduced by also assessing other associated risk factors such as poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n57 \n\nprolonged fasting, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency and any conditions associated with \nhypoxia. \n \nDiagnosis: \nLactic acidosis is characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain and hypothermia followed by \ncoma.  Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH, plasma lactate levels above 5 mmol/l \nand an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio.  If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment \nwith the medicinal product should be discontinued and the patient hospitalised immediately (see \nsection 4.9). \n \nRenal function \nAs metformin is excreted by the kidney, serum creatinine concentrations should be determined \nregularly: \n- at least once a year in patients with normal renal function \n- at least two to four times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at the upper limit of \n\nnormal and in elderly patients. \n \n\nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic.  Special caution should be \nexercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating \nantihypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with an NSAID. \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \nThiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention which may exacerbate or precipitate signs or symptoms \nof congestive heart failure. Rosiglitazone can cause dose-dependent fluid retention.  The possible \ncontribution of fluid retention to weight gain should be individually assessed as rapid and excessive \nweight gain has been reported very rarely as a sign of fluid retention. All patients, particularly those \nreceiving concurrent insulin but also sulphonylurea therapy, those at risk for heart failure, and those \nwith reduced cardiac reserve, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions \nrelating to fluid retention, including weight gain and heart failure.  AVANDAMET must be \ndiscontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.   \n \nThe use of AVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin may be associated with \nincreased risks of fluid retention and heart failure (see section 4.8). The decision to initiate \nAVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea should include consideration of alternative \ntherapies. Increased monitoring of the patient is recommended if AVANDAMET is used in \ncombination particularly with insulin but also with a sulphonylurea. \n \nHeart failure was also reported more frequently in patients with a history of heart failure; oedema and \nheart failure was also reported more frequently in elderly patients and in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal failure. Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited \nexperience in this patient group. Since NSAIDs, insulin and rosiglitazone are all associated with fluid \nretention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. \n  \nCombination with insulin \nAn increased incidence of cardiac failure has been observed in clinical trials when rosiglitazone is \nused in combination with insulin. Insulin and rosiglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema and could increase the risk of ischaemic \nheart disease. Insulin should only be added to established rosiglitazone therapy in exceptional cases \nand under close supervision. \n \nMyocardial Ischaemia \nA retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies indicated that treatment \nwith rosiglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischaemic events. However, \nin their entirety the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are inconclusive (see section 4.8).  \nThere are limited clinical trial data in patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or peripheral arterial \ndisease. Therefore, as a precaution, the use of rosiglitazone is not recommended in these patients, \nparticularly those with myocardial ischaemic symptoms. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n58 \n\n \nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) \nPatients experiencing an ACS have not been studied in rosiglitazone controlled clinical trials. In view \nof the potential for development of heart failure in these patients, rosiglitazone should therefore not be \ninitiated in patients having an acute coronary event and it should be discontinued during the acute \nphase (see section 4.3). \n \nMonitoring of liver function \nThere have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience with \nrosiglitazone (see section 4.8).  There is limited experience with rosiglitazone in patients with elevated \nliver enzymes (ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal).  Therefore, liver enzymes should be \nchecked prior to the initiation of therapy with AVANDAMET in all patients and periodically \nthereafter based on clinical judgement.  Therapy with AVANDAMET should not be initiated in \npatients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) or \nwith any other evidence of liver disease.  If ALT levels are increased to > 3 times the upper limit of \nnormal during AVANDAMET therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible.  \nIf ALT levels remain > 3 times the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued.  If any \npatient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked.  The \ndecision whether to continue the patient on therapy with AVANDAMET should be guided by clinical \njudgement pending laboratory evaluations.  If jaundice is observed, therapy should be discontinued. \n \nEye disorders \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween rosiglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate ophthalmologic referral should \nbe considered. \n \nWeight gain \nIn clinical trials with rosiglitazone there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, which was greater \nwhen used in combination with insulin. Therefore weight should be closely monitored, given that it \nmay be attributable to fluid retention, which may be associated with cardiac failure. \n \nAnaemia \nRosiglitazone treatment is associated with a dose-related reduction of haemoglobin levels.  In patients \nwith low haemoglobin levels before initiating therapy, there is an increased risk of anaemia during \ntreatment with AVANDAMET. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nPatients receiving AVANDAMET in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin may be at risk for \ndose-related hypoglycaemia. Increased monitoring of the patient and a reduction in the dose of the \nconcomitant agent may be necessary. \n \nSurgery \nAs AVANDAMET contains metformin hydrochloride, the treatment should be discontinued 48 hours \nbefore elective surgery with general anaesthesia and should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 \nhours afterwards. \n \nAdministration of iodinated contrast agent \nThe intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies can lead to renal \nfailure.  Therefore, due to the metformin active substance, AVANDAMET should be discontinued \nprior to, or at the time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal \nfunction has been re-evaluated and found to be normal (see section 4.5). \n \nBone disorders \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n59 \n\nLong-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fractures in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone (see section 4.8). The majority of the fractures have occurred in the upper \nlimbs and distal lower limbs. In females, this increased incidence was noted after the first year of \ntreatment and persisted during long-term treatment. The risk of fracture should be considered in the \ncare of patients, especially female patients, treated with rosiglitazone. \n \nOther precautions \nPremenopausal women have received rosiglitazone during clinical studies.  Although hormonal \nimbalance has been seen in preclinical studies (see section 5.3), no significant undesirable effects \nassociated with menstrual disorders have been observed.  As a consequence of improving insulin \nsensitivity, resumption of ovulation may occur in patients who are anovulatory due to insulin \nresistance.  Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nAVANDAMET should be used with caution during concomitant administration of CYP2C8 inhibitors \n(e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin), due to the effect on rosiglitazone pharmacokinetics \n(see section 4.5). Furthermore, AVANDAMET should be used with caution during concomitant \nadministration of cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. \ncimetidine) due to the effect on metformin pharmacokinetics (see section 4.5). Glycaemic control \nshould be monitored closely. AVANDAMET dose adjustment within the recommended posology or \nchanges in diabetic treatment should be considered. \nAll patients should continue their diet with regular distribution of carbohydrate intake during the day.  \nOverweight patients should continue their energy-restricted diet. \nThe usual laboratory tests for diabetes monitoring should be performed regularly. \n \nAVANDAMET tablets contain lactose and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare \nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere have been no formal interaction studies for AVANDAMET, however the concomitant use of the \nactive substances in patients in clinical studies and in widespread clinical use has not resulted in any \nunexpected interactions.  The following statements reflect the information available on the individual \nactive substances (rosiglitazone and metformin). \n \nThere is increased risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication (particularly in the case of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic insufficiency) due to the metformin active substance of \nAVANDAMET (see section 4.4).  Avoid consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing \nalcohol. \nCationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may \ninteract with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted \nin seven normal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, \nincreased metformin systemic exposure (AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%. Therefore, close monitoring \nof glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular \nsecretion are co-administered (see section 4.4). \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with \nCYP2C9 as only a minor pathway.  \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) resulted in a twofold \nincrease in rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. Since there is a potential for an increase in the risk of \ndose-related adverse reactions, a decrease in rosiglitazone dose may be needed. Close monitoring of \nglycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of rosiglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) resulted in a 66% decrease \nin rosiglitazone plasma concentrations. It cannot be excluded that other inducers (e.g. phenytoin, \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n60 \n\ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John’s wort) may also affect rosiglitazone exposure. The \nrosiglitazone dose may need to be increased. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be \nconsidered (see section 4.4). \n \nClinically significant interactions with CYP2C9 substrates or inhibitors are not anticipated. \n \nConcomitant administration of rosiglitazone with the oral antihyperglycaemic agents glibenclamide \nand acarbose did not result in any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. \n \nNo clinically relevant interactions with digoxin, the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin, the CYP3A4 \nsubstrates nifedipine, ethinylestradiol or norethindrone were observed after co-administration with \nrosiglitazone. \n \nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to renal failure, resulting in \nmetformin accumulation and a risk of lactic acidosis.  Metformin should be discontinued prior to, or at \nthe time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards and only after renal function has been \nre-evaluated and found to be normal. \n \nCombination requiring precautions for use \nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes) beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity.  The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperformed, especially at the beginning of treatment.  If necessary, the dosage of the \nantihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal \nproduct and on its discontinuation. \nACE-inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels.  If necessary, the dosage of the \nantihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal \nproduct and on its discontinuation. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor AVANDAMET no preclinical or clinical data on exposed pregnancies or lactation are available. \n \nRosiglitazone has been reported to cross the human placenta and to be detectable in foetal tissues. \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rosiglitazone in pregnant women.  Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The potential risk for humans is unknown.   \n \nTherefore, AVANDAMET should not be used during pregnancy. If a patient wishes to become \npregnant or if pregnancy occurs, treatment with AVANDAMET should be discontinued unless the \nexpected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBoth rosiglitazone and metformin have been detected in the milk of experimental animals.  It is not \nknown whether breast-feeding will lead to exposure of the infant to the medicinal product.  \nAVANDAMET must therefore not be used in women who are breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAVANDAMET has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions are presented below for each of the component parts of AVANDAMET. An adverse \nreaction is only presented for the fixed dose combination if it has not been seen in one of the \ncomponent parts of AVANDAMET or if it occurred at a higher frequency than that listed for a \ncomponent part. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n61 \n\n \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics. Adverse reaction frequency categories \nassigned based on clinical trial experience may not reflect the frequency of adverse events occurring \nduring normal clinical practice. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to \n<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000) and very rare (<1/10,000 \nincluding isolated reports). \n \nAVANDAMET \n \nData from double-blind studies confirm that the safety profile of concomitant rosiglitazone and \nmetformin is similar to that of the combined adverse reaction profile for the two medicinal products. \nData with AVANDAMET is also consistent with this combined adverse reaction profile. \n \nClinical trial data (addition of insulin to established AVANDAMET therapy) \nIn a single study (n=322) where insulin was added to patients established on AVANDAMET, no new \nadverse events were observed in excess of those already defined for either AVANDAMET or \nrosiglitazone combination therapies. \n \nHowever, the risk of both fluid related adverse events and hypoglycaemia are increased when \nAVANDAMET is used in combination with insulin. \n \nRosiglitazone \n \nClinical trial data \nAdverse reactions for each treatment regimen are presented below by system organ class and absolute \nfrequency. For dose-related adverse reactions the frequency category reflects the higher dose of \nrosiglitazone. Frequency categories do not account for other factors including varying study duration, \npre-existing conditions and baseline patient characteristics.  \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions identified from an overview of clinical trials involving over 5,000 \nrosiglitazone-treated patients. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in the \ntable by decreasing frequency for the rosiglitazone monotherapy treatment regimen. Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n62 \n\nTable 1.

The elevated total cholesterol levels were associated with \nan increase in both LDLc and HDLc, but the ratio of total cholesterol: HDLc was unchanged or \nimproved in long term studies.  Overall, these increases were generally mild to moderate and usually \ndid not require discontinuation of treatment. \n \n2  An increased incidence of heart failure has been observed when rosiglitazone was added to treatment \nregimens with a sulphonylurea (either as dual or triple therapy), and appeared higher with 8 mg \nrosiglitazone compared to 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose).  The incidence of heart failure on \ntriple oral therapy was 1.4% in the main double blind study, compared to 0.4% for metformin plus \nsulphonylurea dual therapy.  The incidence of heart failure in combination with insulin (rosiglitazone \nadded to established insulin therapy) was 2.4%, compared to insulin alone, 1.1%.   \n \nIn a placebo-controlled one-year trial in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, \nworsening or possible worsening of heart failure occurred in 6.4% of patients treated with \nrosiglitazone, compared with 3.5% on placebo. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n63 \n\n \n3 In a retrospective analysis of data from 42 pooled short-term clinical studies, the overall incidence of \nevents typically associated with cardiac ischaemia was higher for rosiglitazone containing regimens, \n2.00% versus combined active and placebo comparators, 1.53% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% \nconfidence interval (CI) 1.004 - 1.69)]. This risk was increased when rosiglitazone was added to \nestablished insulin and in patients receiving nitrates for known ischaemic heart disease. In an update to \nthis retrospective analysis that included 10 further studies that met the criteria for inclusion, but were \nnot available at the time of the original analysis, the overall incidence of events typically associated \nwith cardiac ischaemia was not statistically different for rosiglitazone containing regimens, 2.21% \nversus combined active and placebo comparators, 2.08% [HR 1.098 (95% CI 0.809 - 1.354)]. In a \nprospective cardiovascular outcomes study (mean follow-up 5.5 years) the primary endpoint events of \ncardiovascular death or hospitalisation were similar between rosiglitazone and active comparators [HR \n0.99 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.16)]. Two other long-term prospective randomised controlled clinical trials \n(9,620 patients, study duration >3 years in each study), comparing rosiglitazone to some other \napproved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, have not confirmed or excluded the potential risk of \ncardiac ischaemia. In their entirety, the available data on the risk of cardiac ischaemia are \ninconclusive. \n \n4 Long-term studies show an increased incidence of bone fracture in patients, particularly female \npatients, taking rosiglitazone. In a monotherapy study, the incidence in females for rosiglitazone was \n9.3% (2.7 patients per 100 patient years) vs 5.1% (1.5 patients per 100 patient years) for metformin or \n3.5% (1.3 patients per 100 patient years) for glibenclamide. In another long-term study, there was an \nincreased incidence of bone fracture for subjects in the combined rosiglitazone group compared to \nactive control [8.3% vs 5.3%, Risk ratio 1.57 (95% CI 1.26 - 1.97)]. The risk of fracture appeared to \nbe higher in females relative to control [11.5% vs 6.3%, Risk ratio 1.82 (95% CI 1.37 - 2.41)], than in \nmales relative to control [5.3% vs 4.3%, Risk ratio 1.23 (95% CI 0.85 - 1.77)]. Additional data are \nnecessary to determine whether there is an increased risk of fracture in males after a longer period of \nfollow-up. The majority of the fractures were reported in the upper limbs and distal lower limbs (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn double-blind clinical trials with rosiglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three \ntimes the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo (0.2%) and less than that of the active \ncomparators (0.5% metformin/sulphonylureas). The incidence of all adverse events relating to liver \nand biliary systems was <1.5% in any treatment group and similar to placebo. \n \nPost-marketing data  \nIn addition to the adverse reactions identified from clinical trial data, the adverse reactions presented \nin Table 2 have been identified in post approval use of rosiglitazone.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n64 \n\nTable 2.

In clinical studies in \nvolunteers rosiglitazone has been administered at single oral doses of up to 20 mg and was well \ntolerated. \n \nA large overdose of metformin (or coexisting risks of lactic acidosis) may lead to lactic acidosis which \nis a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital.  \n \nIn the event of an overdose, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment is initiated as \ndictated by the patient's clinical status.  The most effective method to remove lactate and metformin is \nhaemodialysis, however rosiglitazone is highly protein bound and is not cleared by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering medicinal products, ATC \ncode: A10BD03 \n \nAVANDAMET combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complimentary mechanisms of action \nto improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: rosiglitazone maleate, a member of the \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n66 \n\nthiazolidinedione class and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.  \nThiazolidinediones act primarily by reducing insulin resistance and biguanides act primarily by \ndecreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.  \n \nRosiglitazone \nRosiglitazone is a selective agonist at the PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) \nnuclear receptor and is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antihyperglycaemic agents.  It \nreduces glycaemia by reducing insulin resistance at adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. \n \nThe antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has been demonstrated in a number of animal models \nof type 2 diabetes.  In addition, rosiglitazone preserved ß-cell function as shown by increased \npancreatic islet mass and insulin content and prevented the development of overt hyperglycaemia in \nanimal models of type 2 diabetes.  Rosiglitazone did not stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion or \ninduce hypoglycaemia in rats and mice.  The major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) with high \naffinity to the soluble human PPARγ, exhibited relatively high potency in a glucose tolerance assay in \nobese mice.  The clinical relevance of this observation has not been fully elucidated. \n \nIn clinical trials, the glucose lowering effects observed with rosiglitazone are gradual in onset with \nnear maximal reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) evident following approximately 8 weeks of \ntherapy.  The improved glycaemic control is associated with reductions in both fasting and post-\nprandial glucose. \n \nRosiglitazone was associated with increases in weight.  In mechanistic studies, the weight increase was \npredominantly shown to be due to increased subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral and intra-hepatic \nfat. \n \nConsistent with the mechanism of action, rosiglitazone in combination with metformin reduced insulin \nresistance and improved pancreatic ß-cell function.  Improved glycaemic control was also associated \nwith significant decreases in free fatty acids.  As a consequence of different but complementary \nmechanisms of action, combination therapy of rosiglitazone with metformin resulted in additive \neffects on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. \n \nIn studies with a maximal duration of three years, rosiglitazone given once or twice daily in dual oral \ntherapy with metformin produced a sustained improvement in glycaemic control (FPG and HbA1c).  A \nmore pronounced glucose-lowering effect was observed in obese patients.  An outcome study has not \nbeen completed with rosiglitazone, therefore the long-term benefits associated with improved \nglycaemic control of rosiglitazone have not been demonstrated. \n \nAn active controlled clinical trial (rosiglitazone up to 8 mg daily or metformin up to 2,000 mg daily) \nof 24 weeks duration was performed in 197 children (10-17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. \nImprovement in HbA1c from baseline achieved statistical significance only in the metformin group. \nRosiglitazone failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to metformin. Following rosiglitazone treatment, \nthere were no new safety concerns noted in children compared to adult patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. No long-term efficacy and safety data are available in paediatric patients. \n \nADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) was a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial with \na treatment duration of 4-6 years (median duration of 4 years), in which rosiglitazone at doses of 4 to \n8 mg/day was compared to metformin (500 mg to 2000 mg/day) and glibenclamide (2.5 to 15 mg/day) \nin 4351 drug naive subjects recently diagnosed (≤3 years) with type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone \ntreatment significantly reduced the risk of reaching monotherapy failure (FPG>10.0 mmol/L) by 63% \nrelative to glibenclamide (HR 0.37, CI 0.30-0.45) and by 32% relative to metformin (HR 0.68, \nCI 0.55-0.85) during the course of the study (up to 72 months of treatment). This translates to a \ncumulative incidence of treatment failure of 10.3% for rosiglitazone, 14.8% for metformin and 23.3% \nfor glibenclamide treated patients. Overall, 43%, 47% and 42% of subjects in the rosiglitazone, \nglibenclamide and metformin groups respectively withdrew due to reasons other than monotherapy \nfailure. The impact of these findings on disease progression or on microvascular or macrovascular \noutcomes has not been determined (see section 4.8). In this study, the adverse events observed were \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n67 \n\nconsistent with the known adverse event profile for each of the treatments, including continuing \nweight gain with rosiglitazone. An additional observation of an increased incidence of bone fractures \nwas seen in women with rosiglitazone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of glycaemia in \nDiabetes) trial was a large (4,447 subjects), open-label, prospective, controlled study (mean follow-up \n5.5 years) in which patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin or \nsulphonylurea were randomised to add-on rosiglitazone or metformin or sulphonylurea. The mean \nduration of diabetes in these patients was approximately 7 years. The adjudicated primary endpoint \nwas cardiovascular hospitalisation (which included hospitalisations for heart failure) or cardiovascular \ndeath. Mean doses at the end of randomised treatment are shown in the following table: \n \nRandomised Treatment† Mean (SD) dose at end of randomised treatment \nRosiglitazone (either SU or metformin) 6.7 (1.9) mg \nSulphonylurea (background metformin)  \n\nGlimepiride* 3.6 (1.8) mg \nMetformin (background sulphonylurea) 1995.5 (682.6) mg \n*Similar relative effective doses (i.e approximately half maximal dose) for other sulphonylureas \n(glibenclamide and glicazide). \n† Patients who took designated treatment as randomised in combination with the correct background \ntreatment and with evaluable data. \n \nNo difference in the number of adjudicated primary endpoint events for rosiglitazone (321/2220) \nversus active control (323/2227) (HR 0.99, CI 0.85-1.16) was observed, meeting the pre-defined non-\ninferiority criterion of 1.20 (non-inferiority p = 0.02). HR and CI for key secondary endpoints were: \nall-cause death (HR 0.86, CI 0.68-1.08), MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - cardiovascular \ndeath, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) (HR 0.93, CI 0.74-1.15), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, CI \n0.59-1.18), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.14, CI 0.80-1.63) and stroke (HR 0.72, CI 0.49-1.06). In \na sub-study at 18 months, add-on rosiglitazone dual therapy was non-inferior to the combination of \nsulphonylurea plus metformin for lowering HbA1c. In the final analysis at 5 years, an adjusted mean \nreduction from baseline in HbA1c of 0.14% for patients on rosiglitazone added to metformin versus an \nincrease of 0.17% for patients taking sulphonylurea added to metformin was seen during treatment \nwith randomised dual-combination therapy (p<0.0001 for treatment difference). An adjusted mean \nreduction in HbA1c of 0.24% was seen for patients taking rosiglitazone added to sulphonylurea, \nversus a reduction in HbA1c of 0.10% for patients taking metformin added to sulphonylurea, \n(p=0.0083 for treatment difference). There was a significant increase in heart failure (fatal and non-\nfatal) (HR 2.10, CI 1.35-3.27) and bone fractures (Risk Ratio 1.57, CI 1.26-1.97) in rosiglitazone-\ncontaining treatments compared to active control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A total of 564 patients \nwithdrew from cardiovascular follow-up, which accounted for 12.3% of rosiglitazone patients and \n13% of control patients; representing 7.2% of patient-years lost for cardiovascular events follow-up \nand 2.0% of patient-years lost for all cause mortality follow-up. \n \nMetformin \nMetformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose.  It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia. \n \nMetformin may act via three mechanisms:  \n- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis \n- in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and \n\nutilisation \n- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption. \n \nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase.   \nMetformin increases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters \n(GLUT-1 and GLUT-4). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n68 \n\nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \nmetabolism.  This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term \nclinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDLc and triglyceride levels. \n \nThe prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood \nglucose control in type 2 diabetes.  Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with \nmetformin after failure of diet alone showed: \n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin \n\ngroup (29.8 events/1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/1,000 patient-years), \np=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups \n(40.1 events/1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of diabetes-related mortality: metformin \n7.5 events/1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years, p=0.017 \n\n- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin 13.5 events/1,000 \npatient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.011), and versus the \ncombined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/1,000 patient-years \n(p=0.021) \n\n- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin 11 events/1,000 \npatient-years, diet alone 18 events/1,000 patient-years (p=0.01). \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAVANDAMET \nAbsorption \nNo statistically significant difference was observed between the absorption characteristics of \nrosiglitazone and metformin from the AVANDAMET tablet and those obtained from rosiglitazone \nmaleate and metformin hydrochloride tablets, respectively. \n \nFood had no effect on the AUC of rosiglitazone or metformin when AVANDAMET was administered \nto healthy volunteers.  In the fed state, Cmax was lower (22% rosiglitazone and 15% metformin) and \ntmax delayed (by approximately 1.5 h rosiglitazone and 0.5 h metformin).  This food-effect is not \nconsidered clinically significant. \n \nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of \nAVANDAMET. \n \nRosiglitazone \nAbsorption \nAbsolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone following both a 4 and an 8 mg oral dose is approximately \n99%.  Rosiglitazone plasma concentrations peak at around 1 h after dosing.  Plasma concentrations are \napproximately dose proportional over the therapeutic dose range.  \nAdministration of rosiglitazone with food resulted in no change in overall exposure (AUC), although a \nsmall decrease in Cmax (approximately 20-28%) and a delay in tmax (approximately 1.75 h) were \nobserved compared to dosing in the fasting state.  These small changes are not clinically significant \nand, therefore, it is not necessary to administer rosiglitazone at any particular time in relation to meals.  \nThe absorption of rosiglitazone is not affected by increases in gastric pH. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution of rosiglitazone is approximately 14 l in healthy volunteers.  Plasma \nprotein binding of rosiglitazone is high (approximately 99.8%) and is not influenced by concentration \nor age.  The protein binding of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) is very high \n(> 99.99%). \n \nMetabolism \nMetabolism of rosiglitazone is extensive with no parent compound being excreted unchanged.  The \nmajor routes of metabolism are N-demethylation and hydroxylation, followed by conjugation with \nsulphate and glucuronic acid.  The contribution of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n69 \n\nthe overall antihyperglycaemic activity of rosiglitazone has not been fully elucidated in man and it \ncannot be ruled out that the metabolite may contribute to the activity.  However, this raises no safety \nconcern regarding target or special populations as hepatic impairment is contraindicated and the phase \nIII clinical studies included a considerable number of elderly patients and patients with mild to \nmoderate renal impairment. \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrate that rosiglitazone is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C8, with a minor \ncontribution by CYP2C9. \n \nSince there is no significant in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A or 4A with \nrosiglitazone, there is a low probability of significant metabolism-based interactions with substances \nmetabolised by these P450 enzymes.  Rosiglitazone showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C8 \n(IC50 18 µM) and low inhibition of CYP2C9 (IC50 50 µM) in vitro (see section 4.5).  An in vivo \ninteraction study with warfarin indicated that rosiglitazone does not interact with CYP2C9 substrates \nin vivo. \n \nElimination \nTotal plasma clearance of rosiglitazone is around 3 l/h and the terminal elimination half-life of \nrosiglitazone is approximately 3-4 h.  There is no evidence for unexpected accumulation of \nrosiglitazone after once or twice daily dosing.  The major route of excretion is the urine with \napproximately two-thirds of the dose being eliminated by this route, whereas faecal elimination \naccounts for approximately 25% of dose.  No intact active substance is excreted in urine or faeces.  \nThe terminal half-life for radioactivity was about 130 h indicating that elimination of metabolites is \nvery slow.  Accumulation of the metabolites in plasma is expected upon repeated dosing, especially \nthat of the major metabolite (a para-hydroxy-sulphate) for which an 8-fold accumulation is anticipated. \n \nSpecial populations \nGender: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no marked differences in the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone between males and females. \n \nElderly: In the pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis, age was not found to influence the \npharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone to any significant extent. \n \nChildren and adolescents: Population pharmacokinetic analysis including 96 paediatric patients aged \n10 to 18 years and weighing 35 to 178 kg suggested similar mean CL/F in children and adults. \nIndividual CL/F in the paediatric population was in the same range as individual adult data. CL/F \nseemed to be independent of age, but increased with weight in the paediatric population. \n \nHepatic impairment: In cirrhotic patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, unbound \nCmax and AUC were 2- and 3-fold higher than in normal subjects.  The inter-subject variability was \nlarge, with a 7-fold difference in unbound AUC between patients. \n \nRenal insufficiency: There are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of \nrosiglitazone in patients with renal impairment or end stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. \n \nMetformin \nAbsorption \nAfter an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 h.  Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg \nmetformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects.  After an oral dose, the non-absorbed \nfraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. \n \nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete.  It is assumed that the \npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear.  At the usual metformin doses and dosing \nschedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than \n1 µg/ml.  In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed \n4 µg/ml, even at maximum doses. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n70 \n\nFood decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin.  Following administration \nof a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC and a 35 min \nprolongation of time to peak plasma concentration was observed.  The clinical relevance of this \ndecrease is unknown. \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding is negligible.  Metformin partitions into erythrocytes.  The blood peak is lower \nthan the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time.  The red blood cells most likely \nrepresent a secondary compartment of distribution.  The mean Vd ranged between 63 – 276 l. \n \nMetabolism \nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.  No metabolites have been identified in humans. \n \nElimination \nRenal clearance of metformin is > 400 ml/min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration and tubular secretion.  Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is \napproximately 6.5 h.  When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to \nthat of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of \nmetformin in plasma. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in AVANDAMET.  The \nfollowing data are findings in studies performed with rosiglitazone or metformin individually. \n \nRosiglitazone \nUndesirable effects observed in animal studies with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \nAn increase in plasma volume accompanied by decrease in red cell parameters and increase in heart \nweight.  Increases in liver weight, plasma ALT (dog only) and fat tissue were also observed.  Similar \neffects have been seen with other thiazolidinediones. \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of rosiglitazone to rats during mid-late gestation was \nassociated with foetal death and retarded foetal development.  In addition, rosiglitazone inhibited \novarian oestradiol and progesterone synthesis and lowered plasma levels of these hormones resulting \nin effects on oestrus/menstrual cycles and fertility (see section 4.4). \n \nIn an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with rosiglitazone at 200 \ntimes the pharmacologically active dose increased tumour multiplicity in the colon.  The relevance of \nthis finding is unknown.  However, rosiglitazone promoted differentiation and reversal of mutagenic \nchanges in human colon cancer cells in vitro.  In addition, rosiglitazone was not genotoxic in a battery \nof in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and there was no evidence of colon tumours in lifetime \nstudies of rosiglitazone in two rodent species. \n \nMetformin \nNon-clinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours.  \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet, tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1.

WHAT AVANDAMET IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nAvandamet tablets are a combination of two different medicines called rosiglitazone and \nmetformin. These two medicines are used to treat type 2 diabetes. \n \nPeople with type 2 diabetes either don’t make enough insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar \nlevels), or don’t respond normally to the insulin their body makes. Rosiglitazone and metformin work \ntogether so your body makes better use of the insulin it produces, and this helps reduce your blood \nsugar to a normal level. Avandamet can be used alone or with a sulphonylurea, another medicine for \ndiabetes. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE AVANDAMET \n \nTo help manage your diabetes, it is important that you follow any diet and lifestyle advice from your \ndoctor as well as taking Avandamet. \n \nDon’t take Avandamet: \n\n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to rosiglitazone or metformin or any of the other \ningredients of Avandamet (listed in Section 6) \n\n• if you have had a heart attack or severe angina, that’s being treated in hospital \n• if you have heart failure, or have had heart failure in the past \n• if you have severe breathing difficulties  \n• if you have liver disease \n• if you are a heavy drinker of alcohol – if you regularly drink a lot, or if you have \n\noccasional sessions of heavy drinking (binge drinking) \n• if you have had diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes causing rapid weight \n\nloss, nausea or vomiting) \n• if you have kidney disease  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n107 \n\n• if you are very dehydrated or have a severe infection (see ‘While you take  \nAvandamet your doctor needs to know’ later in Section 2) \n\n• if you are going to have an X-ray using an injected dye (see ‘While you take  \nAvandamet your doctor needs to know’ later in Section 2) \n\n• if you are breast-feeding (see ‘Pregnancy and breast-feeding’ later in Section 2). \n     Check with your doctor if you think any of these apply to you. Don’t take Avandamet. \n\n \nTake special care with Avandamet \n \nAvandamet is not recommended for people aged under 18, as the safety and effectiveness are not \nknown.  \n \nIf you have been diagnosed with angina (chest pain), or peripheral arterial disease (reduced blood \nflow to the legs): \n\n     Check with your doctor, as Avandamet may not be suitable for you. \n \nConditions to look out for \nAvandamet and other medicines for diabetes can make some existing conditions worse, or cause \nserious side effects.  You must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking Avandamet, to \nreduce the risk of any problems. See ‘Conditions you need to look out for’ in Section 4. \n \nOvulation may restart \nWomen who are infertile due to a condition affecting their ovaries (such as Polycystic Ovarian \nSyndrome), may start ovulating again when they start taking Avandamet. If this applies to you, use \nappropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy (see ‘Pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding’ later in Section 2).  \n \nYour kidney function will be checked \nYour kidneys should be checked at least once a year – more often if you are over 65, or if your kidney \nfunction is close to abnormal. \n \n\nWhile you take Avandamet your doctor needs to know:  \n\n if you become dehydrated – for example, after severe vomiting, diarrhoea or fever. These can \nlead to severe loss of water (dehydration). Speak to your doctor, as you may need to stop taking \nAvandamet for a short while. \n\n• if you are going to have an operation under general anaesthetic. Your doctor will advise you \nto stop taking Avandamet for at least 48 hours before and after the operation. \n\n• if you are going to have an X-ray using an injected dye. Your doctor will advise you to stop \ntaking Avandamet before the X-ray and for 48 hours after it. The doctor will check your kidney \nfunction before restarting treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n108 \n\nTaking other medicines \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, if you’ve taken any recently, or \nif you start taking new ones. This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you bought without a \nprescription.   \n \nCertain medicines are especially likely to affect the amount of sugar in your blood:  \n• steroids (used to treat inflammation) such as prednisolone or dexamethasone \n• beta-2-agonists (used to treat asthma), such as salbutamol or salmeterol \n• diuretics (used to get rid of water), such as furosemide or indapamide \n• ACE inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure), such as enalapril or captopril  \n• gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol) \n• rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections) \n• cimetidine (used to reduce stomach acid). \n\n Tell a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, \nand your dose of Avandamet may need to be changed. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n• Avandamet is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or could be pregnant, \n\ntell your doctor before you take Avandamet. \n \n• Don’t breast-feed while you are taking Avandamet. The ingredients may pass into breast milk \n\nand so may harm your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine should not affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nAvandamet contains lactose  \nAvandamet tablets contain a small amount of lactose. Patients who are intolerant to lactose or have a \nrare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO TAKE AVANDAMET \n \nAlways take Avandamet tablets exactly as your doctor has told you. Do not take more than the \nrecommended dose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nHow much to take \nThe usual starting dose is one combined tablet (2 mg rosiglitazone and 1000 mg metformin), taken \ntwice a day, morning and evening. (You can also take this dose as two 1 mg/500 mg tablets, twice a \nday.) \n \nAfter about 8 weeks your doctor may need to increase your dose. The maximum dose is 4 mg \nrosiglitazone and 1000 mg metformin, taken twice a day. (You can also take this dose as two \n2 mg/500 mg tablets, twice a day.) \n \nHow to take \nSwallow the tablets with some water. \n \nIt is best to take Avandamet with food, or just after food. This helps to reduce any problems with \nyour stomach (including indigestion, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea). \n \nTake your tablets around the same time every day and follow any dietary advice that your doctor has \ngiven you. \n \nIf you take more Avandamet than you should  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n109 \n\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.  \n \nIf you forget to take Avandamet \nDon’t take extra tablets to make up for a missed dose. Just take your next dose at the usual time.  \n \nDon’t stop taking Avandamet \nTake Avandamet for as long as your doctor recommends. If you stop taking Avandamet, your blood \nsugar will not be controlled, and you may become unwell. Talk to your doctor if you want to stop. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Avandamet can cause side effects, but not everybody gets them. \n \nConditions you need to look out for \n \nAllergic reactions: These are very rare in people taking Avandamet. Signs include: \n• raised and itchy rash (hives) \n• swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing \n• collapse. \n\n Contact a doctor immediately if you get any of these symptoms. Stop taking Avandamet. \n \nLactic acidosis: An increase in the amount of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis) is a very rare \nside effect of metformin. This most often affects people who have severe kidney disease. Symptoms of \nlactic acidosis include:  \n• rapid breathing \n• feeling cold \n• stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. \n\n Contact a doctor immediately if you get these symptoms. Stop taking Avandamet. \n \nFluid retention and heart failure: Avandamet can cause you to retain water (fluid retention) which \nleads to swelling and weight gain.  Extra body fluid can make some existing heart problems worse or \nlead to heart failure. This is more likely if you are also taking other medicines for your diabetes (like \ninsulin), if you have kidney problems, or if you are over 65. Check your weight regularly; if it goes \nup rapidly, tell your doctor. Symptoms of heart failure include:  \n• shortness of breath, waking up short of breath at night \n• getting tired easily after light physical activity such as walking \n• rapid increase in your weight \n• swollen ankles or feet. \n\n Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get any of these symptoms - either for the first time \nor if they get worse. \n\n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia): If you are taking Avandamet with other medicines for diabetes, it \nis more likely that your blood sugar could fall below the normal level. Early symptoms of low blood \nsugar are: \n shaking, sweating, faintness \n nervousness, palpitations  \n hunger.  \n\nThe severity can increase, leading to confusion and loss of consciousness.  \n Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get any of these symptoms. The dose of your \n\nmedicines may need to be reduced.  \n \nLiver problems: Before you start taking Avandamet you will have a blood sample taken to check \nyour liver function. This check may be repeated at intervals. These may be signs of liver problems: \n• nausea and vomiting  \n• stomach (abdominal) pain \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n110 \n\n• loss of appetite \n• dark-coloured urine.  \n\n Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you get these symptoms. \n \nEye problems: Swelling of the retina at the back of the eye which can cause blurred vision (macular \noedema) can be a problem for people with diabetes. New or worse cases of macular oedema have \noccurred on rare occasions in people taking Avandamet and similar medicines.   \n\n Discuss with your doctor any concerns about your eyesight.   \n \nBroken bones: Bone fractures can occur in people with diabetes. The chances of this happening may \nbe higher in people, particularly women, taking rosiglitazone for more than one year. The most \ncommon are breaks in feet, hands and arms. \n \nVery common side effects  \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n\n• stomach pain, feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, diarrhoea or loss of appetite. \n \nCommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people:  \n\n• chest pain (angina) \n• broken bones  \n• reduction in blood count (anaemia) \n• small increases in blood cholesterol, increased amount of fats in the blood  \n• increased weight, increased appetite  \n• dizziness  \n• constipation \n• lower blood sugar than normal (hypoglycaemia) \n• swelling (oedema) due to water retention  \n• metallic taste in the mouth. \n\n \nRare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people:  \n\n• fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) causing breathlessness  \n• heart failure  \n• swelling of the retina at the back of the eye (macular oedema)  \n• liver doesn’t function as well as it should (increase in liver enzymes).  \n\n \nVery rare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people:  \n\n• allergic reactions \n• inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) \n• decrease in amount of vitamin B12 in the blood \n• rapid and excessive weight gain caused by fluid retention  \n• increase of lactic acid in the blood. \n\nIf you get side effects \n Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed gets severe or troublesome, or if \n\nyou notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE AVANDAMET \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children.  \n \nDo not use Avandamet after the expiry date shown on the pack. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n111 \n\n \nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions. \n \n \nIf you have any unwanted tablets, don’t put them in waste water or household rubbish.
