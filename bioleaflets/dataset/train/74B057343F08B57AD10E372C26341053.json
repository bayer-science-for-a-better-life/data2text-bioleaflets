NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nNutropinAq 10 mg/2 ml (30 IU) solution for injection. \n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nOne ml contains 5 mg of somatropin* \nOne cartridge contains 10 mg (30 IU) of somatropin \n* Somatropin is a human growth hormone produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA \ntechnology. \n\n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection. \nClear and colourless solution. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nPaediatric population \n \n\n- Long-term treatment of children with growth failure due to inadequate endogenous growth \nhormone secretion. \n \n\n- Long-term treatment of girls from 2 years old with growth failure associated with Turner \nsyndrome. \n \n\n- Treatment of prepubertal children with growth failure associated with chronic renal \ninsufficiency up to the time of renal transplantation. \n\n \nAdult population \n\n \n- Replacement of endogenous growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency of \n\neither childhood or adult-onset etiology. Growth hormone deficiency should be confirmed \nappropriately prior to treatment. \nIn adults with growth hormone deficiency the diagnosis should be established depending on \nthe etiology: \nAdult-onset: The patient must have growth hormone deficiency as a result of hypothalamic or \npituitary disease, and at least one other hormone deficiency diagnosed (except for prolactin). \nTest for growth hormone deficiency should not be performed until adequate replacement \ntherapy for other hormone deficiencies have been instituted. \nChildhood-onset: Patients who have had growth hormone deficiency as a child should be \nretested to confirm growth hormone deficiency in adulthood before replacement therapy with \nNutropinAq is started. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \nDiagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are \nappropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with the \ntherapeutic indication of use. \n \n\n\n\n3  \n\nPosology \n \n\nThe NutropinAq dosage and administration schedule should be individualised for each patient. \n \n\nPaediatric population \n \n\nGrowth failure in children due to inadequate growth hormone secretion \n0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg bodyweight given as a daily subcutaneous injection. \nSomatropin therapy should be continued in children and adolescents until their epiphysis are closed. \n\n \nGrowth failure associated with Turner syndrome \nUp to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight given as a daily subcutaneous injection. \nSomatropin therapy should be continued in children and adolescents until their epiphysis are closed. \n\n \nGrowth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency \nUp to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight given as a daily subcutaneous injection. \nSomatropin therapy should be continued in children and adolescents until their epiphysis are closed, \nor up to the time of renal transplantation. \n\n \nAdult population \n\n \nGrowth hormone deficiency in adults \nAt the start of somatropin therapy, low initial doses of 0.15 - 0.3 mg are recommended, given as a \ndaily subcutaneous injection. The dose should be adjusted stepwise, controlled by serum Insulin-like \nGrowth Factor-1 (IGF-I) values. The recommended final dose seldom exceeds 1.0 mg/day. In \ngeneral, the lowest efficacious dose should be administered. In older or overweight patients, lower \ndoses may be necessary. \n \nWomen may require higher doses than men, with men showing an increasing IGF-I sensitivity over \ntime. This means that there is a risk that women, especially those on oral oestrogen therapy, are under-\ntreated while men are over-treated.  \n\n \nMethod of administration \n\n \nThe solution for injection should be administered subcutaneously each day. The site of injection \nshould be changed. \n\n \nPrecaution to be taken before manipulating or administering the product \n \nNutropinAq is supplied as a multi-dose solution. After removal from the refrigerator, if the solution is \ncloudy, the content must not be injected. Gently swirl. Do not shake vigorously as it could denature \nthe protein. NutropinAq is intended for use only with the NutropinAq Pen. \n\n \nFor instructions for use and handling of the medicinal product, see section 6.6. \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Somatropin \nshould not be used for growth promotion in patients with closed epiphyses. \n \nSomatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour. Intracranial tumours \nmust be inactive and antitumour therapy must be completed prior to starting GH therapy. Treatment \nshould be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth. \n\n \nGrowth hormone should not be initiated to treat patients with acute critical illness due to \ncomplications following open-heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental traumas or to treat \npatients having acute respiratory failure. \n\n\n\n4  \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe maximum recommended daily dose should not be exceeded (see section 4.2).  \n \nNeoplasm \nIn patients with previous malignant disease, special attention should be given to signs and symptoms \nof relapse. \n \nPatients with pre-existing tumors or growth hormone deficiency secondary to an intracranial lesion \nshould be examined routinely for progression or recurrence of the underlying disease process. In \nchildhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported in patients \ntreated with somatropin after their first neoplasm. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, in \npatients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm, were the most common of these \nsecond neoplasms. \n\n \nPrader-Willi syndrome \nNutropinAq is not indicated for the long-term treatment of paediatric patients who have growth \nfailure due to genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome, unless they also have a diagnosis of \ngrowth hormone deficiency. There have been reports of sleep apnoea and sudden death after \ninitiating therapy with growth hormone in paediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had \none or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep \napnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection. \n\n \nAcute critical illness \nThe effects of growth hormone on recovery were studied in two placebo-controlled clinical trials \ninvolving 522 adult patients who were critically ill due to complications following open-heart or \nabdominal surgery, multiple accidental traumas, or who were having acute respiratory failure. \nMortality was higher (41.9 % vs. 19.3 %) among growth hormone treated patients (doses 5.3 - \n8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. \n \nThe safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients with acute critical illness in intensive care \nunits due to complications following open-heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma or \nacute respiratory failure receiving replacement doses for approved indications has not been \nestablished. Therefore, the benefit-risk assessment for continuing treatment should be performed \ncarefully. \n\n \nChronic renal insufficiency \nPatients with growth hormone failure secondary to CRI should be examined periodically for evidence \nof progression of renal osteodystrophy. Slipped capital femoral epiphyses and aseptic necrosis of the \nfemoral head may be seen in children with advanced renal osteodystrophy and in growth hormone \ndeficiency, and it is uncertain whether these problems are affected by GH therapy. Physicians and \nparents should be alert to the development of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain in patients \ntreated with NutropinAq. \n\n \nScoliosis \nScoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth. Signs of scoliosis should be monitored \nduring treatment. However, growth hormone treatment has not been shown to increase the incidence \nor severity of scoliosis. \n\n \nGlycaemic control \nBecause somatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity, patients should be monitored for evidence of \nglucose intolerance. For patients with diabetes mellitus, the insulin dose may require adjustment after \nNutropinAq therapy is instituted. Patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance should be monitored \nclosely during somatropin therapy. Somatropin therapy is not indicated in diabetic patients with \nactive proliferative or severe non-proliferative retinopathy. \n \n\n\n\n5  \n\nIntracranial hypertension \nIntracranial hypertension with papilloedema, visual changes, headache, nausea and/or vomiting has \nbeen reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin. Symptoms usually occur within \nthe first eight weeks of the initiation of NutropinAq therapy. In all reported cases, intracranial \nhypertension-associated signs and symptoms resolved after reduction of the somatropin dose or \ntermination of the therapy. Funduscopic examination is recommended at the initiation and \nperiodically during the course of treatment. \n\n \nHypothyroidism \nHypothyroidism may develop during treatment with somatropin, and untreated hypothyroidism may \nprevent optimal response to NutropinAq. Therefore, patients should have periodic thyroid function \ntests and should be treated with thyroid hormone when indicated. Patients with severe \nhypothyroidism should be treated accordingly prior to the start of NutropinAq therapy. \n\n \nRenal transplantation \nSince somatropin therapy following renal transplantation has not been adequately tested, NutropinAq \ntreatment should be terminated after that surgery. \n\n \nGlucocorticoids use \nConcomitant treatment with glucocorticoids inhibits the growth-promoting effects of NutropinAq. \nPatients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully \nadjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth. The use of NutropinAq in patients with chronic \nrenal insufficiency receiving glucocorticoid therapy has not been evaluated. \n\n \nLeukaemia \nLeukaemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficient patients treated with \ngrowth hormone. A causal relationship to somatropin therapy has not been established. \n\n \nPancreatitis in children \nChildren treated with somatropin have an increased risk of developing pancreatitis compared to \nadults treated with somatropin. Although rare, pancreatitis should be considered in somatropin-\ntreated children who develop abdominal pain. \n \nUse with oral oestrogen therapy \nIf a woman taking NutropinAq begins oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of NutropinAq may need to \nbe increased to maintain the serum IGF-1 levels within the normal age appropriate range. \nConversely, if a woman on NutropinAq discontinues oral oestrogen therapy, the dose of NutropinAq \nmay need to be reduced to avoid excess of growth hormone and/or side effects (see section 4.5). \n\n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per cartridge, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium- free\u201f. \n \nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nLimited published data indicate that growth hormone treatment increases cytochrome P450 mediated \nantipyrine clearance in man. Monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in \ncombination with medicinal products known to be metabolised by CYP450 liver enzymes, such as \ncorticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, and cyclosporin. \n\n \nIn patients treated with somatropin, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may \nbe unmasked requiring glucocorticoid replacement therapy. In addition, patients treated with \nglucocortocoid replacement therapy for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an \nincrease in their maintenance or stress doses, following initiation of somatropin treatment (see \n\n\n\n6  \n\nsection 4.4). \n \nIn patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral \nhypoglycemic medicinal product may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn women on oral oestrogen replacement, a higher dose of growth hormone may be required to \nachieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited data from the use of somatropin in pregnant women. Thus, the risk for \nhumans is unknown. \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nSomatropin is not recommended during pregnancy and should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs. \nDuring pregnancy, maternal somatropin will largely be replaced by placental growth hormone. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether somatropin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. No animal data are \navailable. \nCaution should be exercised while breast-feeding during treatment with NutropinAq. \n\n \nFertility \nThe effect of NutropinAq has not been assessed in conventional animal fertility studies (see section \n5.3) or clinical studies. \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nSomatropin has no known effect on the ability to drive or to use machines. \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe adverse reactions reported in both adults and children receiving Nutropin, NutropinAq, Nutropin \nDepot or Protropin (somatrem) are listed in the table below, based on experience from clinical trials \nall approved indications (642 patients) and post-marketing sources which included a surveillance \nsurvey (National Cooperative Growth Study [NCGS] in 35,344 patients). Approximately 2.5 % of \npatients from the NCGS have experienced drug related adverse reactions. \n\n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions from the pivotal and supportive clinical trials were \nhypothyroidism, impaired glucose tolerance, headache, hypertonia, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral \noedema, oedema, asthenia, injection site reaction and the presence of drug specific antibodies. \n\n \nThe most serious adverse reactions from the pivotal and supportive clinical trials were neoplasm and \nintracranial hypertension. \n\n \nNeoplasms (malignant and benign) were reported in both the pivotal and supportive clinical trials and \nin the post-marketing surveillance survey (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). The majority of neoplasms \nreported were recurrence of previous neoplasms and second neoplasms. \n\n \nIntracranial hypertension was reported in the post-marketing surveillance survey. It is typically \nassociated with papilloedema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting and symptoms \nusually occur within eight weeks of initiation of therapy with NutropinAq. \n\n \nNutropinAq reduces insulin sensitivity; glucose tolerance impairment was reported in both the pivotal \n\n\n\n7  \n\nand supportive clinical trials and the post-marketing surveillance survey. Events of diabetes mellitus \nand hyperglycaemia were reported in the post-marketing surveillance survey (see section 4.4). \n\n \nInjection site reactions such as haemorrhage, atrophy, urticaria and pruritus were reported in the \npivotal and supportive clinical trials and/or the post-marketing surveillance survey. These events can \nbe avoided by correct injection technique and rotation of injection sites. \nA small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to the protein somatropin. The binding capacity \nof growth hormone antibodies was lower than 2 mg/l in NutropinAq subjects tested, which has not \nbeen associated with adversely affected growth rate. \n\n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \nTable 1 contains very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1000, < 1/100); \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000, < 1/1,000) adverse reactions which occurred in clinical trials and a post-marketing \nsurveillance survey. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. Other adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of \nNutropinAq. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is \nnot possible to reliably estimate their frequency. \n\n \nSystem Organ Class Reactions observed in Pivotal and \n\nSupportive Clinical Trials (in 642 \npatients) \n\nReactions observed from the post \nmarketing environment \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified (including \ncysts and polyps) \n\nUncommon: Neoplasm malignant, \nneoplasm benign \n\nRare: Neoplasm malignant \nrecurrence, melanocytic naevus \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon: Anaemia  \n\nEndocrine disorders Common: Hypothyroidism Rare: Hypothyroidism \nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nCommon: Glucose tolerance impaired \nUncommon: Hypoglycaemia, \nhyperphosphatemia \n\nRare: Diabetes mellitus, \nhyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, \nglucose tolerance impaired \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon: Personality disorder Rare: Abnormal behaviour, \ndepression, insomnia \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nCommon: Headache, hypertonia, \nUncommon: Carpal tunnel syndrome, \nsomnolence, nystagmus \n\nUncommon: Headache Rare: Benign \nintracranial \nhypertension, intracranial pressure \nincreased, migraine, carpal tunnel \nsyndrome, paraesthesia, dizziness \n\nEye disorders Uncommon: Papilloedema, diplopia Rare: Papilloedema, vision blurred \nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\nUncommon: Vertigo  \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon: Tachycardia  \nVascular disorders Uncommon: Hypertension Rare: Hypertension \nRespiratory thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Rare: Tonsillar hypertrophy \nUncommon: Adenoidal hypertrophy \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nUncommon: Abdominal pain, \nvomiting, nausea, flatulence \n\nRare: Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, \nnausea, vomiting \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon: Exfoliative dermatitis, \nskin atrophy, skin hypertrophy, \nhirsutism, lipodystrophy, urticaria \n\nRare: Generalised pruritus, urticaria, \nrash \n\n\n\n8  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery common in adults, common in \nchildren: Arthralgia, myalgia \nUncommon: Muscle atrophy, bone \npain \n\nUncommon: Slipped capital femoral \nepiphysis, scoliosis progression, \narthralgia \nRare: Bone development abnormal, \nosteochondrosis, muscular weakness, \npain in extremity \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\nUncommon: Urinary incontinence, \npollakiuria, polyuria, urine \nabnormality \n\n \n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders \n\nUncommon: Uterine haemorrhage, \ngenital discharge \n\nRare: Gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nVery common in adults, common in \nchildren: Peripheral oedema, oedema \nCommon: Asthenia, injection site \nreaction \nUncommon: Injection site \nhaemorrhage, injection site atrophy, \ninjection site mass, hypertrophy \n\nUncommon: Peripheral oedema, \noedema, injection site reaction \n(irritation, pain) \nRare: Asthenia, face oedema, fatigue, \nirritability, pain, pyrexia, injection \nsite reaction (haemorrhage, \nhaematoma, atrophy, urticaria, \npruritus, swelling, erythema) \n\nInvestigations Common: Drug specific antibody \npresent \n\nRare: Blood glucose increased, \nweight increased \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \nNeoplasm \nThere is a risk of neoplasia due to treatment with GH. The underlying risk varies according to the \nunderlying cause for growth hormone deficiency (e.g. secondary to intracranial lesion), associated \nco- morbidities and treatment(s) undertaken. NutropinAq therapy must not be initiated when there is \nevidence of tumour activity. Patients with pre-existing tumours or growth hormone deficiency \nsecondary to an intracranial lesion should be examined routinely for progression or recurrence of the \nunderlying disease process. Treatment must be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth. \n \nIntracranial hypertension \nIn all reported cases, intracranial hypertension associated signs and symptoms resolved after \nreduction of the NutropinAq dose or termination of therapy (see section 4.4). Fundoscopic \nexamination is recommended at the initiation and periodically during the course of treatment. \n \nHypothyroidism \nHypothyroidism may develop during treatment with NutropinAq and untreated hypothyroidism may \nprevent optimal response to NutropinAq. Patients should have periodic thyroid function tests and \nshould be treated with thyroid hormone when required. Patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism \nshould be treated prior to the start of NutropinAq therapy. \n \nGlycaemic control \nAs NutropinAq may reduce insulin sensitivity, patients should be monitored for evidence of glucose \nintolerance. For patients with diabetes mellitus, the dose of insulin may need adjustment after \nNutropinAq therapy is initiated. Patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance should be monitored \nclosely during somatropin therapy. \n \nInjection site reactions \nInjection site reactions may be avoided by using the correct injection technique and rotation of \ninjection sites. \n \n\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis \n\n\n\n9  \n\nPatients with endocrinological disorders are more prone to develop a slipped capital femoral \nepiphysis. \n\n \nIndication-specific adverse drug reactions from clinical trials \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\n \nChildren with growth failure due to inadequate growth hormone secretion (n=236) \nCommon: central nervous system neoplasm (2 patients experienced a recurrent medulloblastoma, 1 \npatient experienced a histiocytoma). See also section 4.4. \n\n \nGirls with growth failure associated with Turner syndrome (n=108) \nCommon: menorrhagia. \n\n \nChildren with growth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency (n=171) \nCommon: renal failure, peritonitis, osteonecrosis, blood creatinine increase. Children with chronic \nrenal insufficiency receiving NutropinAq are more likely to develop intracranial hypertension, \nalthough children with organic GHD and Turner syndrome also have an increased incidence. The \ngreatest risk is at the beginning of treatment. \n\n \nAdult population \n\n \nAdults with growth hormone deficiency (n=127) \nVery common: paraesthesia. \nCommon: hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, insomnia, synovial disorder, arthrosis, muscular \nweakness, back pain, breast pain, gynaecomastia. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions after authorization of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n\n \nSymptoms \n\n \nAcute overdose could lead to hyperglycaemia. Long-term overdose could result in signs and \nsymptoms of gigantism and/or acromegaly consistent with the known effects of excess growth \nhormone. \n\n \nManagement \n\n \nTreatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote for somatropin overdose. It is \nrecommended to monitor thyroid function following an overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, Somatropin and \nanalogues, ATC Code: H01 AC 01 \n\n \nMechanism of action \n\n \n\n\n\n10  \n\nSomatropin stimulates growth rate and increases adult height in children who lack endogenous \ngrowth hormone and in children who have growth failure due to Turner Syndrome or CRI. Treatment \nof growth hormone deficient adults with somatropin results in reduced fat mass, increased lean body \nmass and increased spine bone mineral density. Metabolic alterations in these patients include \nnormalisation of IGF-I serum levels. \n\n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \nIn vitro and in vivo preclinical and clinical tests have demonstrated that somatropin is therapeutically \nequivalent to human growth hormone of pituitary origin. \n\n \nActions that have been demonstrated for human growth hormone include: \n\n \nTissue Growth \n1. Skeletal growth: growth hormone and its mediator IGF-I stimulate skeletal growth in growth \nhormone deficient children by an effect on the epiphyseal plates of long bones. This results in a \nmeasurable increase in body length until these growth plates fuse at the end of puberty. \n2. Cell growth: Treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and size of \nskeletal muscle cells. \n3. Organ growth: Growth hormone increases the size of internal organs, including kidneys, and \nincreases red blood cell mass. \n\n \nProtein metabolism \nLinear growth is facilitated in part by growth hormone-stimulated protein synthesis. This is reflected \nby nitrogen retention as demonstrated by a decline in urinary nitrogen excretion and blood urea \nnitrogen during growth hormone therapy. \n\n \nCarbohydrate metabolism \nPatients with inadequate growth hormone secretion sometimes experience fasting hypoglycaemia that \nis improved by treatment with somatropin. Growth hormone therapy may decrease insulin sensitivity \nand impair glucose tolerance. \n\n \nMineral metabolism \nSomatropin induces retention of sodium, potassium and phosphorus. Serum concentration of \ninorganic phosphorus are increased in patients with growth hormone deficiency after NutropinAq \ntherapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth and increased tubular reabsorption in \nthe kidney. Serum calcium is not significantly altered by somatropin. Adults with growth hormone \ndeficiency show low bone mineral density and in the childhood-onset patient, NutropinAq has been \nshown to increase spine bone mineral density in a dose-dependent manner. \n\n \nConnective tissue metabolism \nSomatropin stimulates the synthesis of chondroitin sulphate and collagen as well as the urinary \nexcretion of hydroxyproline. \n\n \nBody composition \nAdult growth hormone deficient patients treated with somatropin at a mean dosage of 0.014 mg/kg \nbodyweight daily demonstrate a decrease in fat mass and increase in lean body mass. When these \nalterations are coupled with the increase in total body water and bone mass, the overall effect of \nsomatropin therapy is to modify body composition, an effect that is maintained with continued \ntreatment. \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \nGrowth failure in children \n\n \nTwo pivotal, open label, uncontrolled, multicentre studies have been conducted, one exclusively \nin previously untreated patients (n=67), and the other in previously untreated patients (n=63) \n\n\n\n11  \n\nand in children previously treated with somatropin (n=9). The dose in both studies was 0.043 \nmg/kg/day, administered subcutaneously (s.c.). Doses used in these US based studies are consistent \nwith the US approved dose regimen. Of the 139 patients included, 128 completed the first 12 \nmonths of therapy, with an average treatment time of 3.2 and 4.6 years and a total exposure of 542 \npatient years. In both studies there was a significant improvement in growth rate in the na\u00efve \npatients, increasing from 4.2 to 10.9 cm/year in one study and from 4.8 to 11.2 cm/year in the other \nat 12 months. The growth rate decreased after the first year in both studies, but continued to be \ngreater than pretreatment levels for up to 48 months treatment (7.1 cm/year). The height standard \ndeviation score (SDS) improved each year, increasing from -3.0 to -2.7 at baseline to -1.0 to -0.8 at \nMonth 36. The improvements in growth were not accompanied by undue advancement of bone \nage, which would jeopardise future growth potential. Predicted adult height (PAH) increased from \n157.7-161.0 cm at baseline to 161.4-167.4 cm at Month 12 and 166.2-171.1 cm at Month 36. \n\n \nSupportive data are provided by two other studies, in which patients were given a dose of 0.3 \nor 0.6 mg/kg/week either as a daily injection or three times per week, or 0.029 mg/kg/day. The \ndata on growth rate and height SDS were broadly similar to those observed in the pivotal studies. \n\n \nFor 51 patients who achieved near-adult height after an average duration of treatment of 6 years \nin males and 5 years in females, the mean near-adult height SDS was -0.7 in males and -1.2 in \nfemales. \n\n \nIGF-I levels increased from a baseline of 43 ng/ml to 252 ng/ml at 36 months, which approximate \nto the normal levels expected in children of this age. \n\n \nThe most common adverse events (AEs) observed in the pivotal studies were infection, \nheadache, otitis media, fever, pharyngitis, rhinitis and gastroenteritis and vomiting. \n\n \nGrowth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency \n\n \nTwo pivotal, multicentre, controlled studies have been conducted in patients with growth \nfailure associated with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). Each study had a two year treatment \nperiod which included a placebo arm, followed by an open label uncontrolled extension in \nwhich all patients received somatropin. The dose was 0.05 mg/kg/day s.c. in both studies. The \nresults of both studies were similar. \n\n \nIn total, 128 patients received somatropin over the 24 month controlled phase of the 2 studies, \nand 139 patients were treated with somatropin in the open extension phases. Overall, 171 patients \nwere exposed to somatropin for an average of 3.5 or 2.8 years. \n\n \nBoth studies demonstrated a statistically significant increase in growth rate compared to placebo \nover the first year (9.1-10.9 cm/year vs 6.2-6.6 cm/year), which decreased slightly in the \nsecond year (7.4-7.9 cm/year vs 5.5-6.6 cm/year). There was also a significant increase in height \nSDS in somatropin-treated patients, from -2.9 to -2.7 at baseline to -1.6 to -1.4 at 24 months. \nHeight gains were maintained in the patients treated for 36 or 48 months. A total of 58% and \n65% of somatropin-treated patients, who were below normal range at baseline, had reached heights \nwithin the normal range by Month 24. \nThe results to Month 60 show continued improvement, and more patients reached height SDS in \nthe normal range. The average change in height SDS after 5 years of treatment was close to 2 \nstandard deviations (SDs). A statistically significant increase in mean PAH SDS was observed, \nfrom -1.6 or \n-1.7 at baseline to -0.7 or -0.9 at Month 24. This continued to increase in those patients treated for \n36 and 48 months. \n\n \nIGF-I levels, which were low at study entry, were restored to within the normal range with \nsomatropin therapy. \n\n \nThe most frequently reported AEs were associated with both NutropinAq and placebo and were \n\n\n\n12  \n\nfever, infection, vomiting, cough increased, pharyngitis, rhinitis and otitis media. There was a high \nincidence of urinary tract infections. \n\n \nGrowth failure associated with Turner Syndrome \n\n \nOne pivotal, multicentre, open label, controlled study has been conducted in Turner Syndrome. \nPatients received an s.c. dose of 0.125 mg/kg three times a week or 0.054 mg/kg/day, both regimens \ngiving a cumulative weekly dose of approximately 0.375 mg/kg. Patients under 11 years of age were \nalso randomised to receive oestrogen therapy, either in late (aged 15 years) or early (aged 12 years) \nadolescence. \n\n \nA total of 117 patients were treated with somatropin; 36 received somatropin 0.125 mg/kg three times \na week and 81 patients received 0.054 mg/kg somatropin daily. The average treatment time was 4.7 \nyears in the somatropin three times a week group and 4.6 years in the somatropin daily group. \n\n \nGrowth rate increased significantly from 3.6-4.1 cm/year at baseline to 6.7-8.1 cm/year at Month 12, \n6.7-6.8 cm/year at Month 24 and 4.5-5.1 cm/year at Month 48. This was accompanied by a significant \nincrease in height SDS from -0.1 to 0.5 at baseline to 0.0 to 0.7 at Month 12 and 1.6 to 1.7 at Month \n48. Compared with matched historical controls, early somatropin therapy (mean duration of 5.6 years) \ncombined with oestrogen replacement at age 12 years resulted in an adult height gain of 5.9 cm \n(n=26), whereas girls who initiated oestrogen at age 15 years (mean duration of somatropin therapy \n6.1 years) had a mean adult height gain of 8.3 cm (n=29). Thus, the greatest improvement in adult \nheight was observed in patients who received early GH treatment and oestrogen after age 14 years. \n\n \nThe most commonly reported AEs were flu syndrome, infection, headache, pharyngitis, rhinitis and \notitis media. These events are expected in children and were mild/moderate AEs. \n\n \nGrowth hormone deficiency in adults \n\n \nTwo pivotal, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies have been conducted in patients \ndiagnosed with adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD), one in adult-onset AGHD (n=166) and the \nother in childhood-onset AGHD (n=64). The dose of somatropin was 0.0125 mg/kg/day sc in adult-\nonset AGHD and 0.0125 or 0.025 mg/kg/day in childhood-onset AGHD. \nIn both studies, somatropin treatment resulted in significant changes compared to placebo in total \nbody % fat (-6.3 to -3.6 vs +0.2 to-0.1), trunk % fat (-7.6 to -4.3 vs +0.6 to 0.0) and total body % lean \n(+3.6 to +6.4 vs -0.2 to +0.2). These changes were highly significant at the 12-month time point in \nboth studies, and at the 24-month time point in the childhood-onset study. At the 12-month time point, \nthe percentage change was higher in the childhood-onset study than in the adult-onset study. No \nsignificant changes in bone mineral density (BMD) were observed in adult-onset AGHD patients, \nhowever in the childhood-onset study, all groups had an increase in BMD at 24 months, although \nthere was no statistically significant dose response for total body BMD. Lumbar spine BMD had \nstatistically significant increases in both treated groups, and the increase was dose dependent. \n\n \nSupporting data from a study on adult-onset GHD patients were generally consistent with those of the \npivotal studies, with some improvements in BMD. \nThe most frequently reported AEs in the two pivotal studies were headache, oedema, \narthralgia/arthrosis, tenosynovitis, paraesthesia and allergic reaction/rash. The incidence of these AEs \nwas also high in the placebo groups. \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of NutropinAq have only been investigated in healthy adult males.  \n \nGeneral characteristics \n \nAbsorption \nThe absolute bioavailability of recombinant human growth hormone after subcutaneous \n\n\n\n13  \n\nadministration is about 80%. \n \n\nDistribution  \nAnimal studies with somatropin showed that growth hormone localises to highly perfused organs, \nparticularly the liver and kidney. The volume of distribution at steady state for somatropin in \nhealthy adult males is about 50 ml/kg bodyweight, approximating the serum volume. \n\n \nBiotransformation  \nBoth the liver and the kidney have been shown to be important protein catabolising organs for \ngrowth hormone. Animal studies suggest that the kidney is the dominant organ of clearance. Growth \nhormone is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. It is then cleaved \nwithin renal cells into its constituent amino acids, which return to the systemic circulation. \n\n \nElimination  \nAfter subcutaneous bolus administration, the mean terminal half-life t\u00bd of somatropin is about 2.3 \nhours. After intravenous bolus administration of somatropin, the mean terminal half-life t\u00bd\u03b2 or \nt\u00bd\u03b3 is about 20 minutes and the mean clearance is reported to be in the range of 116 - 174 ml/h/kg. \nAvailable literature data suggest that somatropin clearance is similar in adults and children. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\n \nInformation about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in elderly and paediatric populations, in \ndifferent races or genders and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is incomplete. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nAvailable literature data suggests that somatropin clearances are similar in adults and children. \n\n \nOlder people \nLimited published data suggest that the plasma clearance and average steady-state plasma \nconcentration of somatropin may not be different between young and elderly patients. \n\n \nRace \nReported values for half-lives for endogenous GH in normal adult black males are not different from \nobserved values for normal adult white males.  No data for other races are available. \n\n \nGrowth hormone deficiency \nClearance and mean terminal half-life t\u00bd of somatropin in adult and paediatric growth hormone \ndeficient patients are similar to those observed in healthy subjects. \n\n \nRenal impairment \nChildren and adults with chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease tend to have decreased \nclearance compared to normal subjects. Endogenous growth hormone production may also increase \nin some individuals with end-stage renal disease. However, no somatropin accumulation has been \nreported in children with chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease dosed with current \nregimens. \n\n \nTurner syndrome \nLimited published data for exogenously-administered somatropin suggest absorption and elimination \nhalf-lives and time of maximum concentration tmax in Turner patients are similar to those observed in \nboth normal and growth hormone deficient populations. \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction in somatropin clearance has been noted. The \nclinical significance of this decrease is unknown. \n\n \nGender \nNo gender-specific pharmacokinetic studies have been done with NutropinAq. The available \n\n\n\n14  \n\nliterature indicates that the pharmacokinetics of somatropin are similar in men and women. \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for human based on conventional acute and repeated-dose \ntoxicity studies. \n\n \nCarcinogenic potential \n\n \nCarcinogenicity and genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with Nutropin Aq. In genotoxicity \nstudies with other recombinant growth hormone preparations, there was no evidence of gene \nmutation in bacterial reverse mutation assays, chromosomal damage in human lymphocyte and \nmouse bone marrow cells, gene conversion in yeast or unscheduled DNA synthesis in human \ncarcinoma cells. In carcinogenicity studies testing biologically recombinant active growth hormone in \nrats and mice, no increase in the incidence of tumors was shown. \n\n \nToxicity to reproduction and development \n\n \nNo conventional reproduction studies were performed. Somatropin is known to be associated with \ninhibition of the reproduction in male and female rats at doses of 3 IU/kg/day (1 mg/kg/day) or more, \nwith reduced copulation and conception rates, lengthened or absent oestrous cycles, and at \n10 IU/kg/day (3.3 mg/kg/day). Long-term treatment of monkeys during pregnancy and lactation and \nof newborn animals until adolescence, sexual maturity and reproduction did not indicate substantial \ndisturbances of fertility, pregnancy, delivery, nursing or development of progeny. \n\n \nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA) \n\n \nUnder the proposed indications, the use of somatropin is not expected to result in an unacceptable \nrisk to the environment. \n\n \n \n\n6.

What NutropinAq is and what it is used for \n \n\nNutropinAq contains somatropin which is a recombinant growth hormone similar to the human\u2019s \nnatural growth hormone made by your body. It is recombinant, meaning it is made outside of the \nbody by a special process. Growth Hormone (GH) is a chemical messenger made by a small gland in \nyour brain called the pituitary. In children it tells the body to grow, help the bones to develop \nnormally and, in later adult life, GH helps to maintain a normal body shape and metabolism. \n\n \nIn children, NutropinAq is used: \n\u2022 When your body does not make enough growth hormone and for this reason you are not \n\ngrowing properly. \n\u2022 When you have Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic abnormality in girls (absence \n\nof female sexual chromosome(s)) that prevents growth. \n\u2022 When your kidneys are damaged and they lose their ability to function normally with an impact \n\non growth. \n \n\nIn adults NutropinAq is used for: \n\u2022 If your body does not make enough growth hormone as an adult. This can start during adult life \n\nor continue from when you were a child. \n \nBenefits if using this medicine \n \nIn children, it helps the body to grow and the bones to develop normally. \nIn adults, it helps to maintain normal body shape and metabolism for example lipid profile and \nglucose levels. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NutropinAq  \n \nDo not use NutropinAq: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to somatropin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\u2022 in children if the bones have already stopped growing. \n\u2022 if you have an active tumour (cancer). Tell your doctor if you have or have had an active \n\n\n\n35  \n\ntumour. Tumours must be inactive and you must have finished your anti-tumour treatment \nbefore you start treatment with NutropinAq. \n\n\u2022 if you have complications after a major surgery (open-heart or abdominal surgery), a multiple \ntrauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions. \n\n \nWarning and Precautions \n \nTalk to you doctor or pharmacist before using NutropinAq. \n\n \n\u2022 If you experience visual changes, bad or frequent headache, associated with feeling sick \n\n(nausea) or vomiting, especially at the start of treatment, tell your doctor immediately. These \ncould be signs of a temporary increase in pressure within the brain (intracranial hypertension). \n\n\u2022 If during growing, a limp or hip or knee pain develops, ask the doctor for advice. \n\u2022 If you notice a curve of your spine (scoliosis) you will need to be checked often by your doctor \n\nas scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth. \n\u2022 Your doctor should monitor you for high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) during treatment \n\nwith NutropinAq. If you are treated with insulin, your doctor may need to adjust your insulin \ndose. If you have diabetes and associated severe/worsening eye disease you should not be \ntreated with NutropinAq. \n\n\u2022 Your doctor should check your thyroid function periodically and if necessary prescribe \nadequate treatment. If you have an underactive thyroid gland leading to low levels of thyroid \nhormone (hypothyroidism) it should be treated before you start NutropinAq treatment. If your \nhypothyroidism is not treated, it could stop NutropinAq from working. \n\n\u2022 If you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids you should consult your doctor \nregularly as you may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose. \n\n\u2022 If you have had a tumour (cancer) in the past, specially a tumour affecting the brain, your \ndoctor should pay special attention and examine you regularly for a possible return of the \ntumour. \n\n\u2022 A small number of growth hormones deficient patients treated with growth hormone have had \nleukaemia (blood cancer). However, no cause and effect relationship with growth hormone \ntreatment has been proven. \n\n\u2022 If you undergo a kidney transplant NutropinAq treatment should be stopped. \n\u2022 If you have complications after major surgery (open-heart or abdominal surgery), multiple \n\ntrauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions, your doctor should decide whether it is \nsafe to continue NutropinAq treatment. \n\n\u2022 There may be an increased risk of developing an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) in \nchildren compared to adults treated with growth hormone. In case of severe and persistent \nabdominal pain, consult your doctor. \n\n\u2022 If you have Prader-Willi syndrome, you should not be treated with NutropinAq unless you \nhave growth hormone deficiency. \n\n \n \nOther medicines and NutropinAq \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\u2022 if you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids it may reduce the effect of NutropinAq \n\non growth. You should consult your doctor regularly as you may need adjustment of your \nglucocorticoid dose. \n\n \n\u2022 if you are treated with insulin, your doctor may need to adjust your insulin dose. \n\n \n\u2022 if you are treated with sex steroids, anticonvulsants or cyclosporin ask the doctor for advice. If \n\nyou are diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency during NutropinAq treatment, you require steroid \ntreatment. If you are already treated for adrenal insufficiency you may require an adjustment \nof your steroid dose. \n\n\n\n36  \n\n \n\u2022 in particular, inform your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following \n\nmedicines. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of NutropinAq or of the other medicines: \n- Oestrogen taken orally or other sex hormones \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \nYou should stop taking NutropinAq if you are pregnant. \nCaution should be exercised while breast-feeding during treatment with NutropinAq. \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n\n \nNo effect on ability to drive or use machines has been noticed while using NutropinAq. \n\n \nNutropinAq is essentially \u201csodium free\u201d \n\n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-\nfree\u201d. \n\n \n \n\n3. How to use NutropinAq \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. NutropinAq therapy should be carried out under regular guidance \nof a doctor who is experienced in growth hormone deficiency. \n \nThe dose of NutropinAq to be injected will be decided by your doctor. Do not change the dosage \nwithout consulting your doctor. The recommended dose is: \n \nIn children with growth hormone deficiency: \n0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg bodyweight injected each day under the skin (subcutaneous injection). \n\n \nIn girls with Turner syndrome: \nUp to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight injected each day under the skin (subcutaneous injection). \n\n \nIn children with chronic renal insufficiency: \nUp to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight injected each day under the skin (subcutaneous injection).  You can \ncontinue treatment with NutropinAq until you have a kidney transplant. \n\n \nIn adults with growth hormone deficiency: \nLow initial doses of 0.15 - 0.3 mg injected each day under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Then \nthe doctor can increase the dose depending on your response. The final dose is rarely above 1.0 \nmg/day. In general, the lowest dose leading to a response should be given to you. \n\n \nTreatment with NutropinAq is a long-term therapy. For further information ask your doctor. \n\n \nHow to inject NutropinAq \n \nThe dose of NutropinAq to be injected will be decided by your doctor. You have to inject NutropinAq \nevery day under the skin (subcutaneous injection). It is important to change the place where you have \nyour injection every day to avoid damaging your skin. \nNutropinAq is supplied as a multi-dose solution. After removal from the refrigerator, if the solution is \ncloudy, the content must not be injected. Gently swirl. Do not shake vigorously as it could denature \nthe protein. \n \n\n\n\n37  \n\nTo inject NutropinAq you should use the NutropinAq Pen. For each injection you should use a new \nsterile injection needle. Read all the instructions for use carefully (on the reverse) before you start \nusing NutropinAq Pen. At the start of therapy, it is recommended that a doctor or a nurse give you \nthe injection and train you with the NutropinAq Pen. After this training, you will be able to inject \nyourself or be injected by a trained care-giver. \n\n \nIf you use more NutropinAq than you should \n \nIf you have injected more NutropinAq than you should have, contact your doctor for advice. If you \ninject too much NutropinAq, your blood sugar level may decrease and become too low and then rise \ntoo high (hyperglycaemia). \n\n \nIf you inject too much NutropinAq over a long period of time (years), you may experience some \novergrowth of parts of your body such as ears, nose, lips, tongue and cheekbone (gigantism and/or \nacromegaly). \n\n \nIf you forget to take NutropinAq \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Continue with your usual dosage the next \nday and tell your doctor at your next appointment. \n\n \nIf you stop using NutropinAq \n \nAsk advice from you doctor before you stop using NutropinAq. If you stop using NutropinAq too \nearly or for too long, the results will not be as expected. \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any change or increase in growth of birthmarks and/or \nmoles (melanocytic naevus). In case of a tumour or re-growth of previous tumours (confirmed by \nyour doctor), treatment with NutropinAq must be stopped immediately. This side effect is \nuncommon, it may affect up to 1 in 100 patients. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience visual changes, bad or frequent headaches, associated \nwith feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting. These could be symptoms of a temporary increase in pressure \nwithin the brain (intracranial hypertension). If you have intracranial hypertension, your doctor may \ndecide to temporarily reduce or discontinue NutropinAq therapy. Then therapy may be started again \nafter the episode is over. This side effect is rare, it may affect up to 1 in 1,000 patients. \n\n \nOther side effects include: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 patients) \n \nSwelling of the hands and feet due to an accumulation of fluid (peripheral oedema) sometimes \nassociated with localised muscle pain (myalgia) and pain in joints (arthralgia).  These side effects \nappear usually in adults early in treatment and are short-lived. Oedema was reported as common in \nchildren. \n\n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n \nUnderactivity of the thyroid gland leading to low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism). If your \nhypothyroidism is not treated, it could stop NutropinAq from working. Your doctor should check your \n\n\n\n38  \n\nthyroid function periodically and if necessary prescribe adequate treatment. \n \nReduced ability to absorb sugar (glucose) from your blood leading to high blood sugar levels \n(hyperglycemia). Your doctor should monitor you for signs of this during treatment with NutropinAq. \nIf you are treated with insulin, your doctor may need to adjust your insulin dose. \n \nFeeling of weakness (asthenia) and increased muscle tension (hypertonia) \n \nPain, bleeding, bruising, rash and itching at the site of injection. These can be avoided by using the \ncorrect injection technique and changing the sites of injection. \n \nSome patients may develop antibodies (a type of protein produced by the body) to somatropin. When \nthese antibodies were found in patients, it did not prevent them from growing. \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n \nDecrease in the number of red blood cells in the blood (anaemia), decrease in blood sugar level \n(hypoglycaemia) and increase in phosphate levels (hyperphosphatemia). \n \nPersonality changes or abnormal behaviour. \n \nPersistent stinging, burning sensation, pain and/or numbness in the palm of the hand due to a trapped \nnerve at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome). \n \nRapid involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), swelling of the optic nerve in the eye \n(papilloedema), double vision (diplopia), headache, somnolence and vertigo. \n \nIncreased heart rate (tachycardia) and high blood pressure (hypertension). Vomiting, stomach pain, \nwind (flatulence) and feeling of sickness (nausea). \n \nSensitive and dry skin (exfoliative dermatitis), changes in thickness of the skin, excessive growth of \nhair on the face and body (hirsutism), hives (urticaria). \n \nCurvature of the spine (scoliosis). If you have scoliosis, you will need to be frequently checked for an \nincrease in the curve. \n \nBone disorder where the upper leg (femur) moves apart from the hip (slipped capital femoral \nepiphysis). This happens generally in patients who grow rapidly. Patients with endocrinological \ndisorders are more prone to develop a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. \n \nDecrease in muscle size (muscle atrophy), joint pain (arthralgia) and bone pain. \n \nDifficulty to hold-in urine (urinary incontinence), high frequency (pollakiuria) and volume (polyuria) \nof urination. \n \nBleeding from the womb (uterine haemorrhage) and genital discharge. \n \nLocalised loss/gain of fat from the skin (lipodystrophy, injection site atrophy/hypertrophy)  \nEnlarged adenoids with similar symptoms as enlarged tonsils (see rare). \n \nRare (may effect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n \nIncrease in blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus). Diabetes mellitus can lead to \nincreased urination, thirst and hunger. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should inform \nyour doctor. \n \nEnlarged tonsils leading to snoring, difficulty breathing or swallowing, brief interruption of breathing \n\n\n\n39  \n\nduring sleep (sleep apnea), or fluid in the ear, as well as infections of the ear. If this appears to be \nparticularly troublesome, you should discuss it with your doctor. \n \nAbnormal sensations of tingling, pricking or numbness (paraesthesia), abnormal bone development, \ndisease affecting progress of bone growth (osteochondrosis) and muscle weakness. \n \nOther rare side effects seen with NutropinAq treatment include itching over the whole body, rash, \nblurred vision, increased weight, dizziness, diarrhoea, swelling of the face, fatigue, pain, fever, breast \nenlargement (gynaecomastia), depression and difficulty to sleep (insomnia). \n \nIndication specific side effects seen during clinical trials \n \nIn children with growth hormone deficiency brain (central nervous system) tumours were commonly \nreported. From the 236 patients enrolled into the clinical studies 3 patients had a central nervous \nsystem tumour. Of the 3 patients with a central nervous system tumour, 2 patients experienced a \nrecurrent medulloblastoma and 1 patient experienced a histiocytoma. See also section \u201cwarning and \nprecautions\u201d. \n \nGirls with Turner syndrome commonly reported abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation. \n \nChildren with chronic renal insufficiency commonly reported inflammation of the lining of the abdomen \n(peritonitis), bone necrosis and an increase of creatinine blood levels. They are more likely to develop \nincreased pressure in the brain (intracranial hypertension), with the greatest risk at the beginning of \ntreatment, although children with organic growth hormone deficiency and Turner syndrome also have \nan increased incidence. \n \nAdults with growth hormone deficiency commonly reported abnormal sensations of tingling, pricking \nor numbness (paraesthesia), abnormally high levels of blood glucose, excess of lipids (fat) in the \nblood, sleeplessness, joint disorders, arthrosis (degenerative joint disease), muscle weakness, back \npain, breast pain and breast enlargement (gynaecomastia). \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5.

We also suggest \nyou consult your doctor or nurse for a demonstration. \n \nThe NutropinAq Pen is designed for use only with cartridges of NutropinAq (for subcutaneous use \nonly). \nAs shown by the illustrations below, NutropinAq pen and cartridges are available in two designs (with \nor without additional yellow colour). The working of the pen and the content of the cartridges are the \nsame for both designs. Either of the NutropinAq cartridge designs can be used with either of the \nNutropinAq Pen designs. \n \n\n \n \nOnly use the pen needles recommended by your doctor or nurse. \n \nThe dosage scale located beside the window of the cartridge holder should not be used as a dose \nmeasurement. It should only be used to estimate the dosage remaining in the cartridge. Always refer to \nthe LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), not audible clicks, for setting an injection of NutropinAq. The \nclicks are only audible confirmation that the black dose knob has been moved. \n \nAlways store the pen and cartridges in a clean, safe place in the refrigerator at a temperature between \n2-8\u00b0C and out of children\u2019s reach and sight. Protect from intense light. Use a cooler to store your \nNutropinAq Pen when travelling. The NutropinAq is designed to withstand a nominal (one hour \nmaximum) period of time outside of the refrigerator on a daily basis. Avoid areas of extreme \ntemperature. Check the expiry date of the cartridge before use. \n \n \nTo guard against the spread of infection, follow these safety measures: \n \n\n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before using your pen. \n\u2022 Clean the cartridge rubber seal with an alcohol swab or cotton ball saturated with alcohol. \n\u2022 Avoid touching the cartridge rubber seal at all times. \n\u2022 If you accidentally touch the cartridge rubber seal, clean it with an alcohol swab. \n\u2022 Do not use the same needle for more than one person. \n\u2022 Use needles only once. \n\n \n \n\nNutropinAq Pen Components: \n \nShown below are the items necessary for giving an injection. Gather all of these components prior to \nuse. \n\n\n\n44  \n\n \nYour NutropinAq cartridge and Pen will be supplied separately. \n \n \nPart I: Preparing and Injecting \n \nFollow the instructions in this section if you are using the pen for the first time or are replacing an \nempty cartridge. \n \nInspect all new cartridges prior to use. Occasionally, after refrigeration, you may notice that small \ncolourless particles are present in the NutropinAq solution. This is not unusual for solutions \ncontaining proteins like NutropinAq and does not affect the strength of the product. Allow the \ncartridge to come to room temperature and gently swirl. Do not shake. If the solution is cloudy or hazy \nor contains any solid matter, the cartridge should not be used. Return the cartridge to your pharmacist \nor prescribing doctor. \n \n\n1. Remove the green pen cap and unscrew the cartridge holder from the pen. If \nnecessary, remove the empty cartridge and discard it properly. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n2. Press the white reset button. \n \n\n3. Turn the black dose knob counter-clockwise back to its starting position until it \nno longer turns. (See illustration.) Then turn the dose knob clockwise until the first \nclick position is reached (approximately 1/4 turn). This ensures that the plunger \npush rod is reset to the starting position. If this is not done when the dosage knob is \nfirst pushed in, NutropinAq will be wasted or the cartridge may crack. \n\n \n4. Insert cartridge into the cartridge holder, then screw the cartridge holder back \nonto the pen. (Be careful not to touch the rubber seal.) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n5. Remove the paper seal from a new needle assembly and screw it onto the cartridge holder. \n \n\n6. Carefully remove both protective caps from the needle by pulling gently. Do not throw the larger \ncap away as it will be used later for proper needle removal and disposal. \n\n \n7. Holding the pen with the needle pointing upward, gently tap the cartridge holder \n\n\n\n45  \n\nto move any air bubbles to the top. While still holding the pen in the upright \nposition, push in the black dose knob until it clicks into position. You should see a \ndrop of solution appear. \nBe patient. If the medicine does not appear within a few seconds, you may need \nto push the reset button again. \n\n \n8. If no drop of medicine appears, push the white reset button again. Now turn the \nblack dose knob clockwise (See illustration) by one click (0.1mg). If you \naccidentally turn it too far, go back one click (0.1 mg). \n\n \n \n \n\n9. While still holding the pen in the upright position, push in the black dose knob again and watch \nthe needle tip for a drop of medicine to appear. Repeat steps 8 and 9 until it appears. \n\n \n10. Press the white reset button. \n\n \n11. Set the required dose by turning the black dose knob. If you cannot dial the full \ndose, either start a new cartridge (as described in Part I), or inject the partial dose. \nThen, start a new cartridge (as described in Part I) to administer the remaining \nportion of your medication. Your doctor or nurse will advise you on the procedure \nfor administering the last dose in the cartridge. \n\n \nPrepare the injection site by wiping with an antiseptic impregnated swab. Injection sites \ninclude the upper arms, abdomen, and upper thighs. Change the injection sites to avoid \ndiscomfort. Even if you develop a preference for one site, you still should rotate the injection \nsite. \n\n \n\n   Upper Arm \n \n\n   Abdomen \n \n \n\n    Thigh \n \n \n\n12. If you are using the passive shield (or no shield) proceed to step 13. If you are \nusing the active shield, slide the shield onto the pen and push the 2 black lock \nknobs on the needle shield toward the tip. \n\n \n \n \n13. Set the tip of the pen on the prepared injection site and press the needle into the skin by pushing \nthe pen downward until the shield is totally depressed. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to do \n\n\n\n46  \n\nthis. Now you are ready to administer the dose. Press down on the black dose knob. Wait 5 seconds \nafter the button is pushed, then withdraw the pen from the skin. A drop of blood may appear. Put a \nplaster on the injection site if you wish. \n\n \n14. Pull the needle shield off the pen (if you have used one) and place the larger needle cap on a flat \nsurface. Slide the needle in to pick it up and push the cap completely down over the needle. Twist off \nthe needle and discard it properly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you how to dispose of the items you \nhave used for the injection. Always store your disposal container out of the reach of children. \n\n \n15. Attach the pen cap and return it to its case with the black dose knob pressed in. You should \nalways store the pen in a refrigerator. Do not remove cartridge between injections. DO NOT \nFREEZE. \n\n \nFor subsequent injections with the NutropinAq Pen, attach a new needle, push the white reset \nbutton and dial your dose. \n \n \nPart II: Storage and Maintenance \n \nFollow these tips to ensure proper care of your NutropinAq Pen: \n \n\n\u2022 Always keep your NutropinAq Pen and cartridge refrigerated and protected from light when \nnot in use. \n\n\u2022 You may remove the pen and cartridge from the refrigerator up to 45 minutes prior to use. \n\u2022 Do not let your NutropinAq Pen and/or cartridge freeze. Contact your doctor or nurse for \n\na replacement if either the pen or cartridge does not work. \n\u2022 Avoid excessive temperatures.  The solution in the cartridge is stable for up to 28 days \n\nafter first use when stored at 2 - 8\u00b0C. \n\u2022 If your pen requires cleaning, do not place under water. Use a damp cloth to wipe away dirt. \n\nDo not use alcohol. \n\u2022 When priming a new cartridge, you may need to repeat Part I, steps 8 and 9 up to a total of \n\n6 times (0.6 mg) to remove air bubbles. Small bubbles may remain and will not affect the dose. \n\u2022 The pen should contain the NutropinAq that is being used. Do not remove cartridge \n\nbetween injections. \n\u2022 The NutropinAq cartridge may be used for up to 28 days. \n\u2022 Do not store the NutropinAq Pen with needle attached. \n\n \n \nPart III: Needles for the NutropinAq Pen \n \nYour doctor or nurse will recommend a needle that is appropriate for you. Always use the needles \nrecommended. \n \nNeedles from other countries may not fit on your NutropinAq Pen. If you travel outside the European \nUnion, make sure you take enough needles for the duration of your stay. \n \n \nPart IV: Commonly Asked Questions \n \nQ: Do I need to change the needle every time I use my NutropinAq Pen? \nA: Yes. A new needle should be used for every injection. The needle is only sterile on the first use. \n \nQ: Where should I store my NutropinAq Pen? \nA: Your NutropinAq Pen should be stored in the case, inside a refrigerator when a cartridge is \ninserted. When travelling, place your pen case in a cooler. DO NOT FREEZE. \n \nQ: Why do I keep my medication in the refrigerator? \n\n\n\n47  \n\nA: To maintain its strength. \n \nQ: Can I store my NutropinAq Pen in the freezer? \nA: No. Freezing will damage the pen and medicine. \n \nQ: How long can I keep my NutropinAq Pen and cartridge outside the refrigerator? \nA: We recommend no longer than one hour. Your doctor or nurse will advise you regarding pen \nstorage. \n \nQ: What is the maximum dose the NutropinAq Pen can deliver in one injection? \nA: The NutropinAq Pen can give a minimum dose of 0.1 mg up to a maximum dose of 4.0 mg (40 \nclicks). If you attempt to dose more than 4 mg at a time, the medicine will either be forced out of the \nneedle and wasted or excess pressure will be placed upon the cartridge and it may crack. \n \nQ: Is it possible to turn the black dose knob back if I click too many times? \nA: Yes. You can turn the black dose knob backwards until the correct number appears in the LCD. \n \nQ: What should I do if there is not enough solution left in the cartridge for my next dose? \nA: Your doctor or nurse will advise you what to do for the last dose in the cartridge. \n \nQ: Why do I have to rewind the black dose knob on my NutropinAq Pen every time I replace the \ncartridge? \nA: This ensures that the plunger push rod completely resets itself back to the starting position. If this \nis not done, liquid will come out of the needle when a new cartridge is placed into the pen. \n \nQ: Can I use my NutropinAq Pen without the shields? \nA: Yes. Your NutropinAq Pen works without shields. The shields are optional to help you administer \nyour injection. \n \nQ: What should I do if I drop my NutropinAq Pen? \nA: If you drop the NutropinAq Pen, check to see if the cartridge is damaged. You should also check the \npen to see that the black dose knob is moving up and down properly and that the LCD counter is working. \nIf your cartridge or pen is damaged, ask your doctor or nurse for a replacement. \n \nQ: How long can I use my NutropinAq Pen? \nA: The NutropinAq Pen is designed to last 24 months from the time you first use your pen. \n \nQ: What does a blinking \u201cbt\u201f mean in the LCD? \nA: The battery in your NutropinAq Pen is losing its charge. Please contact your doctor or nurse for a \nreplacement pen. Batteries typically last 24 months and have a 4-week life from the time the \u201ebt\u201f first \nstarts blinking. \n \nQ: How do I replace my NutropinAq Pen? \nA: Contact your doctor or nurse if you need a replacement part or if you need to replace your entire \npen. \n \nFor more information, please contact the local representative. Your local representative and the \nmanufacturer for the NutropinAq Pen device are the same as for the medicinal product detailed overleaf. \nPlease see section 6 overleaf for contact details. \n \nManufacturer: IPSEN PHARMA BIOTECH S.A.S., Parc d\u2019Activit\u00e9s du Plateau de Signes, CD no \n402, 83870 Signes, France \n \nThis leaflet was last approved in <{MM/YYYY}> \n \nCE 0459 \n \n\n\n\n48  \n\n \nNutropininAq is a registered trademark of Genentech, Inc.  \n\n\n\n49  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS \n\nOF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) \n \n\n\n\n50  \n\nScientific conclusions \n \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for somatropin, the scientific \nconclusions of CHMP are as follows:  \n \nAll products: \n \nBased on available literature, higher doses of growth hormone are generally required during the \ninitiation and maintenance phases of treatment in women with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-\ngonadal axis and on oral oestrogens. Therefore, in order to achieve an equivalent clinical and \nbiochemical response compared to men dose adjustments may need to be considered by the \nprescriber in female patients. \n \nOmnitrope (MAH: Sandoz), Zomacton and associated names (MAH: Ferring), Norditropin and \nassociated names (MAH: Novo Nordisk), Genotropin and associated names (MAH: Pfizer) \n \nBased on available literature, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can be affected and needs to be re-\nassessed during growth hormone therapy in growth hormone deficient patients, who were previously \nnot found to be deficient in this axis. If necessary, glucocorticoid replacement should be initiated. In \naddition, patients already receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy may need to have the dose of \ntheir replacement therapy adjusted, after somatropin treatment is initiated.  \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for somatropin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing somatropin is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

of the body by a special process. growth hormone (gh) is a chemical messenger made by a small gland in your brain called the pituitary. in children it tells the body to grow, help the bones to develop normally and, in later adult life, gh helps to maintain a normal body shape and metabolism. in children, nutropinaq is used: when your body does not make enough growth hormone and for this reason you are not growing properly. when you have turner syndrome. turner syndrome is a genetic abnormality in girls (absence of female sexual chromosome(s)) that prevents growth. when your kidneys are damaged and they lose their ability to function normally with an impact on growth. in adults nutropinaq is used for: if your body does not make enough growth hormone as an adult. this can start during adult life or continue from when you were a child. benefits if using this medicine in children, it helps the body to grow and the bones to develop normally. in adults, it helps to maintain normal body shape

anti-tumour treatment before you start treatment with nutropinaq. if you have complications after a major surgery (open-heart or abdominal surgery), a multiple trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions. warning and precautions talk to you doctor or pharmacist before using nutropinaq. if you experience visual changes, bad or frequent headache, associated with feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting, especially at the start of treatment, tell your doctor immediately. these could be signs of a temporary increase in pressure within the brain (intracranial hypertension). if during growing, a limp or hip or knee pain develops, ask the doctor for advice. if you notice a curve of your spine (scoliosis) you will need to be checked often by your doctor as scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth. your doctor should monitor you for high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) during treatment with nutropinaq. if you are treated with insulin, your doctor may need to adjust your insulin dose. if you have diabetes and associated severe/worsening eye disease you should not be treated with nutropinaq. your doctor should check your thyroid function periodically and if necessary prescribe adequate treatment. if you have an underactive thyroid gland leading to low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) it should be treated before you start nutropinaq treatment. if your hypothyroidism is not treated, it could stop nutropinaq from working. if you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids you should consult your doctor regularly as you may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose. if you have had a tumour (cancer) in the past, specially a tumour affecting the brain, your doctor should pay special attention and examine you regularly for a possible return of the tumour. a small number of growth hormones deficient patients treated with growth hormone have had leukaemia (blood cancer). however, no cause and effect relationship with growth hormone treatment has been proven. if you undergo a kidney transplant nutropinaq treatment should be stopped. if you have complications after major surgery (open-heart or abdominal surgery), multiple trauma, acute respiratory failure, or similar conditions, your doctor should decide whether it is safe to continue nutropinaq treatment. there may be an increased risk of developing an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) in children compared to adults treated with growth hormone. in case of severe and persistent abdominal pain, consult your doctor. if you have prader-willi syndrome, you should not be treated with nutropinaq unless you have growth hormone deficiency. other medicines and nutropinaq tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might take any other medicines. if you have a replacement therapy with glucocorticoids it may reduce the effect of nutropinaq on growth. you should consult your doctor regularly as you may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose. if you are treated with insulin, your doctor may need to adjust your insulin dose. if you are treated with sex steroids, anticonvulsants or cyclosporin ask the doctor for advice. if you are diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency during nutropinaq treatment, you require steroid treatment. if you are already treated for adrenal insufficiency you may require an adjustment of your steroid dose. in particular, inform your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following medicines. your doctor may need to adjust the dose of nutropinaq or of the other

pharmacist if you are not sure. nutropinaq therapy should be carried out under regular guidance of a doctor who is experienced in growth hormone deficiency. the dose of nutropinaq to be injected will be decided by your doctor. do not change the dosage without consulting your doctor. the recommended dose is: in children with growth hormone deficiency: 0.025 - 0.035 mg/kg bodyweight injected each day under the skin (subcutaneous injection). in girls with turner syndrome: up to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight injected each day under the skin (subcutaneous injection). in children with chronic renal insufficiency: up to 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight injected each day under the skin (subcutaneous injection). you can continue treatment with nutropinaq until you have a kidney transplant. in adults with growth hormone deficiency: low initial doses of 0.15 - 0.3 mg injected each day under the skin (subcutaneous injection). then the doctor can increase the dose depending on your response. the final dose is rarely above 1.0 mg/day. in general, the lowest dose leading to a response should be given to you. treatment with nutropinaq is a long-term therapy. for further information ask your doctor. how to inject nutropinaq the dose of nutropinaq to be injected will be decided by your doctor. you have to inject nutropinaq every day under the skin (subcutaneous injection). it is important to change the place where you have your injection every day to avoid damaging your skin. nutropinaq is supplied as a multi-dose solution. after removal from the refrigerator, if the solution is cloudy, the content must not be injected. gently swirl. do not shake vigorously as it could denature the protein. to inject nutropinaq you should use the nutropinaq pen. for each injection you should use a new sterile injection needle. read all the instructions for use carefully (on the reverse) before you start using nutropinaq pen. at the start of therapy, it is recommended that a doctor or a nurse give you the injection and train you with the nutropinaq pen. after this training, you will be able to inject yourself or be injected by a trained care-giver. if you use more nutropinaq than you should if you have injected more nutropinaq than you should have, contact your doctor for advice. if you inject too much nutropinaq, your blood sugar level may decrease and become too low and then rise too high (hyperglycaemia). if you inject too much nutropinaq over a long period of time (years), you may experience some overgrowth of parts of your body such as ears, nose, lips, tongue and cheekbone (gigantism and/or acromegaly). if you forget to take nutropinaq do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. continue with your usual dosage the next day and tell your doctor at your next appointment. if you stop using nutropinaq ask advice from you doctor before you stop using nutropinaq. if you stop using nutropinaq too early or for too long, the results will not be as expected. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nutropinaq", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

them. tell your doctor immediately if you notice any change or increase in growth of birthmarks and/or moles (melanocytic naevus). in case of a tumour or re-growth of previous tumours (confirmed by your doctor), treatment with nutropinaq must be stopped immediately. this side effect is uncommon, it may affect up to 1 in 100 patients. tell your doctor immediately if you experience visual changes, bad or frequent headaches, associated with feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting. these could be symptoms of a temporary increase in pressure within the brain (intracranial hypertension). if you have intracranial hypertension, your doctor may decide to temporarily reduce or discontinue nutropinaq therapy. then therapy may be started again after the episode is over. this side effect is rare, it may affect up to 1 in 1,000 patients. other side effects include: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 patients) swelling of the hands and feet due to an accumulation of fluid (peripheral oedema) sometimes associated with localised muscle pain (myalgia) and pain in joints (arthralgia). these side effects appear usually in adults early in treatment and are short-lived. oedema was reported as common in children. common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) underactivity of the thyroid gland leading to low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism). if your hypothyroidism is not treated, it could stop nutropinaq from working. your doctor should check your 38 thyroid function periodically and if necessary prescribe adequate treatment. reduced ability to absorb sugar (glucose) from your blood leading to high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). your doctor should monitor you for signs of this during treatment with nutropinaq. if you are treated with insulin, your doctor may need to adjust your insulin dose. feeling of weakness (asthenia) and increased muscle tension (hypertonia) pain, bleeding, bruising, rash and itching at the site of injection. these can be avoided by using the correct injection technique and changing the sites of injection. some patients may develop antibodies (a type of protein produced by the body) to somatropin. when these antibodies were found in patients, it did not prevent them from growing. uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) decrease in the number of red blood cells in the blood (anaemia), decrease in blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia) and increase in phosphate levels (hyperphosphatemia). personality changes or abnormal behaviour. persistent stinging, burning sensation, pain and/or numbness in the palm of the hand due to a trapped nerve at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome). rapid involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), swelling of the optic nerve in the eye (papilloedema), double vision (diplopia), headache, somnolence and vertigo. increased heart rate (tachycardia) and high blood pressure (hypertension). vomiting, stomach pain, wind (flatulence) and feeling of sickness (nausea). sensitive and dry skin (exfoliative dermatitis), changes in thickness of the skin, excessive growth of hair on the face and body (hirsutism), hives (urticaria). curvature of the spine (scoliosis). if you have scoliosis, you will need to be frequently checked for an increase in the curve. bone disorder where the upper leg (femur) moves apart from the hip (slipped capital femoral epiphysis). this happens generally in patients who grow rapidly. patients with endocrinological disorders are more prone to develop a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. decrease in muscle size (muscle atrophy), joint pain (arthralgia) and bone pain. difficulty to hold-in urine (urinary incontinence), high frequency (pollakiuria) and volume (polyuria) of urination. bleeding from the womb (uterine haemorrhage) and genital discharge. localised loss/gain of fat from the skin (lipodystrophy, injection site atrophy/hypertrophy) enlarged adenoids with similar symptoms as enlarged tonsils (see rare). rare (may effect up to 1 in 1,000 people) increase in blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus). diabetes mellitus can lead to increased urination, thirst and hunger. if you experience any of these symptoms, you should inform your doctor. enlarged tonsils leading to snoring, difficulty breathing or swallowing, brief interruption of breathing 39 during sleep (sleep apnea), or fluid in the ear, as well as infections of the ear. if this appears to be particularly troublesome, you should discuss it with your doctor. abnormal sensations of tingling, pricking or numbness (paraesthesia), abnormal bone development, disease affecting progress of bone growth (osteochondrosis) and muscle weakness. other rare side effects seen with nutropinaq treatment include itching over the whole body, rash, blurred vision, increased weight, dizziness, diarrhoea, swelling of the face, fatigue, pain, fever, breast enlargement (gynaecomastia), depression and difficulty to sleep (insomnia). indication specific side effects seen during clinical trials in children with growth hormone deficiency brain (central nervous system) tumours were commonly reported. from the 236 patients enrolled into the clinical studies 3 patients had a central nervous system tumour. of the 3 patients with a central nervous system tumour, 2 patients experienced a recurrent medulloblastoma and 1 patient experienced a histiocytoma. see also section \"warning and precautions\". girls with turner syndrome commonly reported abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation. children with chronic renal insufficiency commonly reported inflammation of the lining of the abdomen (peritonitis), bone necrosis and an increase of creatinine blood levels. they are more likely to develop increased pressure in the brain (intracranial hypertension), with the greatest risk at the beginning of treatment, although children with organic growth hormone deficiency and turner syndrome also have an increased incidence. adults with growth hormone deficiency commonly reported abnormal sensations of tingling, pricking or numbness (paraesthesia), abnormally high levels of blood glucose, excess of lipids (fat) in the blood, sleeplessness, joint disorders, arthrosis (degenerative joint disease), muscle weakness, back pain, breast pain and breast enlargement (gynaecomastia). reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nutropinaq", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,
