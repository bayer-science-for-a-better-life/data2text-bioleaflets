PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nClear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRoActemra, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for: \n \n\n• the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults not \npreviously treated with MTX.  \n\n• the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have either responded \ninadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-\nmodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. \n\n \nIn these patients, RoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where \ncontinued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.   \nRoActemra has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray \nand to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \nRoActemra is indicated for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in \npatients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs \nand systemic corticosteroids. RoActemra can be given as monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX \nor where treatment with MTX is inappropriate) or in combination with MTX. \n \nRoActemra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile \nidiopathic polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in \npatients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX. \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment \nwith MTX is inappropriate. \n \nRoActemra is indicated for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or \nlife-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in adults and paediatric patients 2 years of age and \nolder.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment \nof RA, sJIA, pJIA or CRS.  \nAll patients treated with RoActemra should be given the Patient Alert Card. \n \nPosology \nRA Patients \n \nThe recommended posology is 8 mg/kg body weight, given once every four weeks.  \n \nFor individuals whose body weight is more than 100 kg, doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not \nrecommended (see section 5.2). \n \nDoses above 1.2 g have not been evaluated in clinical studies (see section 5.1). \n \nDose adjustments due to laboratory abnormalities (see section 4.4). \n \n• Liver enzyme abnormalities \n \nLaboratory Value Action \n\n> 1 to 3 x Upper \nLimit of Normal \n(ULN) \n\nModify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nFor persistent increases in this range, reduce RoActemra dose to 4 mg/kg or \ninterrupt RoActemra until alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) have normalised \n\nRestart with 4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg, as clinically appropriate \n\n> 3 to 5 x ULN \n\n(confirmed by \nrepeat testing, see \nsection 4.4). \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing until < 3 x ULN and follow recommendations \nabove for > 1 to 3 x ULN \n\nFor persistent increases > 3 x ULN, discontinue RoActemra \n\n> 5 x ULN Discontinue RoActemra \n\n \n• Low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \n \nIn patients not previously treated with RoActemra, initiation is not recommended in patients with an \nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2 x 109/l. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nLaboratory Value \n(cells x 109/ l ) \n\nAction \n\nANC > 1  Maintain dose \n\nANC 0.5 to 1 Interrupt RoActemra dosing \n\nWhen ANC increases > 1 x 109/ l resume RoActemra at 4 mg/kg and increase to \n8 mg/kg as clinically appropriate \n\nANC < 0.5 Discontinue RoActemra \n\n \n• Low platelet count \n \nLaboratory Value \n(cells x 103/ μL) \n\nAction \n\n50 to 100 Interrupt RoActemra dosing \n\nWhen platelet count > 100 x 103/ μ resume RoActemra at 4 mg/kg and increase \nto 8 mg/kg as clinically appropriate \n\n< 50 Discontinue RoActemra \n\n \nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) (adults and paediatrics) \nThe recommended posology for treatment of CRS given as a 60-minute intravenous infusion is \n8 mg/kg in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 12 mg/kg in patients weighing less than \n30 kg. RoActemra can be given alone or in combination with corticosteroids.  \n \nIf no clinical improvement in the signs and symptoms of CRS occurs after the first dose, up to 3 \nadditional doses of RoActemra may be administered. The interval between consecutive doses should \nbe at least 8 hours. Doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in CRS patients.  \n \nPatients with severe or life-threatening CRS frequently have cytopenias or elevated ALT or AST due \nto the underlying malignancy, preceding lymphodepleting chemotherapy or the CRS.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric patients   \n \nsJIA Patients \n \nThe recommended posology in patients above 2 years of age is 8 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in \npatients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 12 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in patients weighing \nless than 30 kg. The dose should be calculated based on the patient’s body weight at each \nadministration. A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient’s body \nweight over time. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of intravenous RoActemra in children below 2 years of age has not been \nestablished.  \n \nDose interruptions of tocilizumab for the following laboratory abnormalities are recommended in sJIA \npatients in the tables below. If appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other medications \nshould be modified or dosing stopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the clinical situation \nhas been evaluated. As there are many co-morbid conditions that may affect laboratory values in sJIA, \n\n\n\n5 \n\nthe decision to discontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical \nassessment of the individual patient. \n \n\n• Liver enzyme abnormalities \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n\nAction \n\n> 1 to 3 x ULN Modify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nFor persistent increases in this range, interrupt RoActemra until \nALT/AST have normalized.  \n\n> 3 x ULN to 5x \nULN \n\n \n\nModify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing until < 3x ULN and follow \nrecommendations above for >1 to 3x ULN \n\n \n\n> 5x ULN Discontinue RoActemra.  \n\nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in sJIA for a laboratory \nabnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the \nindividual patient. \n\n \n• Low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n(cells x \n109/ l ) \n\nAction \n\nANC > 1  Maintain dose \n\nANC 0.5 to \n1 \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing \n\nWhen ANC increases to > 1 x 109/ l resume RoActemra  \n\nANC < 0.5 Discontinue RoActemra \n\nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in sJIA for a laboratory \nabnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the individual \npatient. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n• Low platelet count  \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n\n(cells x 103/µl) \n\nAction \n\n50 to 100 Modify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing \n\nWhen platelet count is > 100 x 103/µl resume RoActemra  \n\n \n\n< 50  Discontinue RoActemra.  \n\nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in sJIA for a laboratory \nabnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the \nindividual patient. \n\n \nReduction of tocilizumab dose due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in sJIA patients. \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical improvement is observed within 6 weeks of initiation of treatment \nwith RoActemra. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient exhibiting no \nimprovement within this timeframe. \n \npJIA Patients \n \nThe recommended posology in patients above 2 years of age is 8 mg/kg once every 4 weeks in \npatients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 10 mg/kg once every 4 weeks in patients weighing \nless than 30 kg. The dose should be calculated based on the patient’s body weight at each \nadministration. A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient’s body \nweight over time. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of intravenous RoActemra in children below 2 years of age has not been \nestablished.  \n \nDose interruptions of tocilizumab for the following laboratory abnormalities are recommended in pJIA \npatients in the tables below.

As there are many co-morbid conditions that may effect laboratory values in pJIA, \nthe decision to discontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical \nassessment of the individual patient. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n• Liver enzyme abnormalities \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n\nAction \n\n> 1 to 3 x ULN Modify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nFor persistent increases in this range, interrupt RoActemra until \nALT/AST have normalized.  \n\n> 3 x ULN to 5x \nULN \n\n \n\nModify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing until < 3x ULN and follow \nrecommendations above for >1 to 3x ULN \n\n \n\n> 5x ULN Discontinue RoActemra.  \n\nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in pJIA for a laboratory \nabnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the \nindividual patient. \n\n \n• Low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n(cells x \n109/ l ) \n\nAction \n\nANC > 1  Maintain dose \n\nANC 0.5 to \n1 \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing \n\nWhen ANC increases to > 1 x 109/ l resume RoActemra  \n\nANC < 0.5 Discontinue RoActemra \n\nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in pJIA for a laboratory \nabnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the individual \npatient. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n• Low platelet count  \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n\n(cells x 103/µl) \n\nAction \n\n50 to 100 Modify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing \n\nWhen platelet count is > 100 x 103/µl resume RoActemra  \n\n \n\n< 50  Discontinue RoActemra.  \n\nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in pJIA for a laboratory \nabnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the \nindividual patient. \n\n \nReduction of tocilizumab dose due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in pJIA patients. \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical improvement is observed within 12 weeks of initiation of treatment \nwith RoActemra. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient exhibiting no \nimprovement within this timeframe. \n \nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients >65 years of age.  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment. RoActemra has not been \nstudied in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). Renal function should \nbe monitored closely in these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nRoActemra has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose \nrecommendations can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAfter dilution, RoActemra for RA, sJIA, pJIA, and CRS patients should be administered as an \nintravenous infusion over 1 hour. \n \nRA, sJIA, pJIA and CRS Patients ≥ 30 kg \nRoActemra should be diluted to a final volume of 100 mL with sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection using aseptic technique.  \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.  \n \nsJIA,pJIA and CRS Patients < 30 kg \nRoActemra should be diluted to a final volume of 50 mL with sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection using aseptic technique. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections  \nSerious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive \nagents including RoActemra (see section 4.8, undesirable effects). RoActemra treatment must not be \ninitiated in patients with active infections (see section 4.3). Administration of RoActemra should be \ninterrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled (see section 4.8). \nHealthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use of RoActemra in patients \nwith a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, \ndiabetes and interstitial lung disease which may predispose patients to infections. \n \nVigilance for the timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving \nbiological treatments for moderate to severe RA, sJIA or pJIA as signs and symptoms of acute \ninflammation may be lessened, associated with suppression of the acute phase reaction. The effects of \ntocilizumab on C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils and signs and symptoms of infection should be \nconsidered when evaluating a patient for a potential infection. Patients (which includes younger \nchildren with sJIA or pJIA who may be less able to communicate their symptoms) and \nparents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients, should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional \nimmediately when any symptoms suggesting infection appear, in order to assure rapid evaluation and \nappropriate treatment. \n \nTuberculosis \nAs recommended for other biological treatments, RA, sJIA and pJIA patients should be screened for \nlatent tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to starting RoActemra therapy. Patients with latent TB should \nbe treated with standard anti-mycobacterial therapy before initiating RoActemra. Prescribers are \nreminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood test results, \nespecially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised.  \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, \nwasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after \ntherapy with RoActemra.   \n \nViral reactivation \nViral reactivation (e.g. hepatitis B virus) has been reported with biologic therapies for RA. In clinical \nstudies with tocilizumab, patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded. \n \nComplications of diverticulitis \nEvents of diverticular perforations as complications of diverticulitis have been reported uncommonly \nwith RoActemra in RA patients (see section 4.8). RoActemra should be used with caution in patients \nwith previous history of intestinal ulceration or diverticulitis. Patients presenting with symptoms \npotentially indicative of complicated diverticulitis, such as abdominal pain, haemorrhage and/or \nunexplained change in bowel habits with fever should be evaluated promptly for early identification of \ndiverticulitis which can be associated with gastrointestinal perforation. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with infusion of RoActemra (see \nsection 4.8). Such reactions may be more severe, and potentially fatal in patients who have \nexperienced hypersensitivity reactions during previous infusions even if they have received \npremedication with steroids and antihistamines. Appropriate treatment should be available for \nimmediate use in the event of an anaphylactic reaction during treatment with RoActemra. If an \nanaphylactic reaction or other serious hypersensitivity / serious infusion related reaction occurs, \nadministration of RoActemra should be stopped immediately and RoActemra should be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n \nActive hepatic disease and hepatic impairment \nTreatment with RoActemra, particularly when administered concomitantly with MTX, may be \nassociated with elevations in hepatic transaminases, therefore, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \nHepatotoxicity \nTransient or intermittent mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been reported \ncommonly with RoActemra treatment (see section 4.8). An increased frequency of these elevations \nwas observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) were used in combination with \nRoActemra. When clinically indicated, other liver function tests including bilirubin should be \nconsidered. \n \nSerious drug-induced liver injury, including acute liver failure, hepatitis and jaundice, have been \nobserved with RoActemra (see section 4.8). Serious hepatic injury occurred between 2 weeks to more \nthan 5 years after initiation of RoActemra. Cases of liver failure resulting in liver transplantation have \nbeen reported. Patients should be advised to immediately seek medical help if they experience signs \nand symptoms of hepatic injury.  \n \nCaution should be exercised when considering initiation of RoActemra treatment in patients with \nelevated ALT or AST > 1.5 x ULN. In patients with baseline ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, treatment is not \nrecommended. \n \nIn RA, pJIA and sJIA patients, ALT/AST should be monitored every 4 to 8 weeks for the first 6 \nmonths of treatment followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. For recommended modifications, \nincluding RoActemra discontinuation, based on transaminases levels see section 4.2. For ALT or AST \nelevations > 3–5 x ULN, confirmed by repeat testing, RoActemra treatment should be interrupted.  \n \nHaematological abnormalities \nDecreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with tocilizumab \n8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in \npatients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist. \n \nIn patients not previously treated with RoActemra, initiation is not recommended in patients with an \nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2 x 109/l. Caution should be exercised when considering \ninitiation of RoActemra treatment in patients with a low platelet count (i.e. platelet count below \n100 x 103/ μL). In patients who develop an ANC < 0.5 x 109/ l or a platelet count < 50 x 103/μL, \ncontinued treatment is not recommended. \n \nSevere neutropenia may be associated with an increased risk of serious infections, although there has \nbeen no clear association between decreases in neutrophils and the occurrence of serious infections in \nclinical trials with RoActemra to date.   \n \nIn RA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and \nthereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC \nand platelet counts, see section 4.2. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nIn sJIA and pJIA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored at the time of second infusion \nand thereafter according to good clinical practice, see section 4.2. \n \nLipid parameters \nElevations in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides were observed in patients treated with tocilizumab (see \nsection 4.8). In the majority of patients, there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in \ntotal cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering agents. \n \nIn sJIA, pJIA and RA patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks \nfollowing initiation of RoActemra therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical \nguidelines for management of hyperlipidaemia. \n \nNeurological disorders \nPhysicians should be vigilant for symptoms potentially indicative of new-onset central demyelinating \ndisorders. The potential for central demyelination with RoActemra is currently unknown. \n \nMalignancy \nThe risk of malignancy is increased in patients with RA. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may \nincrease the risk of malignancy. \n \nVaccinations \nLive and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with RoActemra as clinical safety \nhas not been established. In a randomized open-label study, adult RA patients treated with RoActemra \nand MTX were able to mount an effective response to both the 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide and tetanus toxoid vaccines which was comparable to the response seen in patients on \nMTX only. It is recommended that all patients, particularly sJIA and pJIA patients, be brought up to \ndate with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating \nRoActemra therapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of RoActemra therapy \nshould be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents. \n \nCardiovascular risk \nRA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and should have risk factors \n(e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care. \n \nCombination with TNF antagonists \nThere is no experience with the use of RoActemra with TNF antagonists or other biological treatments \nfor RA, sJIA or pJIA patients. RoActemra is not recommended for use with other biological agents.  \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains 1.17 mmol (or 26.55 mg) sodium per maximum dose of 1200 mg. To \nbe taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. Doses below 1025 mg of this \nmedicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg), i.e. essentially ‘sodium free’. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nsJIA Patients \nMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a serious life-threatening disorder that may develop in \nsJIA patients. In clinical trials, tocilizumab has not been studied in patients during an episode of active \nMAS. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nConcomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab with 10-25 mg MTX once \nweekly had no clinically significant effect on MTX exposure. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on tocilizumab clearance. \n \nThe expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate \nchronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory \ntherapy, such as tocilizumab, is introduced. \n \nIn vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in \nCYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Tocilizumab normalises expression \nof these enzymes. \n \nIn a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following \na single dose of tocilizumab, to the level similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy \nsubjects.  \n \nWhen starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal products which are \nindividually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2 or 2C9 (e.g. . methylprednisolone, \ndexamethasone, (with the possibility for oral glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome), atorvastatin, \ncalcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or \nbenzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic \neffect. Given its long elimination half-life (t1/2), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity \nmay persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after \ntreatment. \n \nPregnancy  \nThere are no adequate data from the use of tocilizumab in pregnant women. A study in animals has \nshown an increased risk of spontaneous abortion/embryo-foetal death at a high dose (see section 5.3). \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n \nRoActemra should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether tocilizumab is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of tocilizumab in \nmilk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or \nto continue/discontinue therapy with RoActemra should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding to the child and the benefit of RoActemra therapy to the woman. \n \nFertility \nAvailable non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under tocilizumab treatment.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRoActemra has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8, dizziness). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported ADRs (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients treated with tocilizumab \nmonotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, \nnasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nThe most serious ADRs were serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity \nreactions. \n \nRA Patients \nThe safety profile of tocilizumab has been studied in 4 placebo-controlled studies (studies II, III, IV \nand V), 1 MTX-controlled study (study I) and their extension periods (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe double-blind controlled period was 6 months in four studies (studies I, III, IV and V) and was up \nto 2 years in one study (study II). In the double-blind controlled studies, 774 patients received \ntocilizumab 4 mg/kg in combination with MTX, 1870 patients received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in \ncombination with MTX or other DMARDs and 288 patients received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg \nmonotherapy.  \n \nThe long-term exposure population includes all patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab \neither in the double-blind control period or open label extension phase in the studies. Of the 4009 \npatients in this population, 3577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3296 for at least one year, \n2806 received treatment for at least 2 years and 1222 for 3 years. \n \nADRs from clinical trials and/or post marketing experience with RoActemra based on spontaneous \ncase reports, literature cases and cases from non-interventional study programs are listed in Table 1 \nand are presented by MedDRA system organ class. The corresponding frequency category for each \nADR is based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (>1/10,000 to <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nTable 1.

In the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of \ninfections with RoActemra was 108 events per 100 patient years exposure. \n \nIn 6-month controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus \nDMARDs was 5.3 events per 100 patient years exposure compared to 3.9 events per 100 patient years \nexposure in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the monotherapy study the rate of serious infections \nwas 3.6 events per 100 patient years of exposure in the tocilizumab group and 1.5 events per 100 \npatient years of exposure in the MTX group.  \n \nIn the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of serious infections (bacterial, viral and fungal) \nwas 4.7 events per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections, some with fatal outcome, included \nactive tuberculosis, which may present with intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary disease, invasive \npulmonary infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis and pneumocystis \njirovecii, pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial \narthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported. \n \nInterstitial Lung Disease \nImpaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections. There have been post-\nmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of \nwhich had fatal outcomes. \n \nGastrointestinal Perforation \nDuring the 6-month controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.26 \nevents per 100 patient years with tocilizumab therapy. In the long-term exposure population the \noverall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.28 events per 100 patient years. Reports of \ngastrointestinal perforation on tocilizumab were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis \nincluding generalised purulent peritonitis, lower gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae and abscess. \n \nInfusion reactions  \nIn the 6-month controlled trials adverse events associated with infusion (selected events occurring \nduring or within 24 hours of infusion) were reported by 6.9% of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg \nplus DMARD group and 5.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Events reported during \nthe infusion were primarily episodes of hypertension; events reported within 24 hours of finishing an \ninfusion were headache and skin reactions (rash, urticaria). These events were not treatment limiting. \n \nThe rate of anaphylactic reactions (occurring in a total of 8/4,009 patients, 0.2%) was several fold \nhigher with the 4 mg/kg dose, compared to the 8 mg/kg dose. Clinically significant hypersensitivity \nreactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported in a total \nof 56 out of 4,009 patients (1.4%) treated with tocilizumab during the controlled and open label \nclinical studies. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fifth infusions of \ntocilizumab (see section 4.4). Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported after marketing authorisation during \ntreatment with tocilizumab (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunogenicity  \nA total of 2,876 patients have been tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies in the 6-month controlled \nclinical trials. Of the 46 patients (1.6%) who developed anti-tocilizumab antibodies, 6 had an \nassociated medically significant hypersensitivity reaction, of which 5 led to permanent discontinuation \nof treatment. Thirty patients (1.1%) developed neutralising antibodies.  \n \nHaematological abnormalities: \nNeutrophils \nIn the 6-month controlled trials decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 109/ l occurred in 3.4% of \npatients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to < 0.1% of patients on placebo plus \nDMARDs. Approximately half of the patients who developed an ANC < 1 x 109/ l did so within 8 \n\n\n\n16 \n\nweeks after starting therapy. Decreases below 0.5 x 109/ l were reported in 0.3% patients receiving \ntocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs. Infections with neutropenia have been reported.   \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \ndecreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled \nclinical trials. \n \nPlatelets \nIn the 6-month controlled trials decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 103/ μL occurred in 1.7% of \npatients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to < 1% on placebo plus DMARDs. These \ndecreases occurred without associated bleeding events. \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \ndecreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical \ntrials. \n \nVery rare reports of pancytopenia have occurred in the post marketing setting. \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \nDuring the 6-month controlled trials transient elevations in ALT/AST > 3 x ULN were observed in \n2.1% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg compared to 4.9% of patients on MTX and in 6.5% of \npatients who received 8 mg/kg tocilizumab plus DMARDs compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo \nplus DMARDs. \n \nThe addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab monotherapy resulted in \nincreased frequency of these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST > 5 x ULN were observed in 0.7% of \ntocilizumab monotherapy patients and 1.4% of tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the majority of \nwhom were discontinued permanently from tocilizumab treatment. During the double-blind controlled \nperiod, the incidence of indirect bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal, collected as a routine \nlaboratory parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + DMARD. A total of 5.8% \nof patients experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin of > 1 to 2 x ULN and 0.4% had an elevation \nof > 2 x ULN. \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \nelevation in ALT/AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical \ntrials. \n \nLipid parameters \nDuring the 6-month controlled trials, increases of lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, \ntriglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or HDL cholesterol have been reported commonly. With routine \nlaboratory monitoring it was seen that approximately 24% of patients receiving RoActemra in clinical \ntrials experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol ≥ 6.2 mmol/ l, with 15% experiencing a \nsustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/ l. Elevations in lipid parameters responded to treatment with \nlipid-lowering agents. \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \nelevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled trials. \n \nMalignancies \nThe clinical data are insufficient to assess the potential incidence of malignancy following exposure to \ntocilizumab. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing. \n \nSkin Reactions \nRare reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have occurred in the post marketing setting. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nsJIA and pJIA Patients \n \nThe safety profile of tocilizumab in the pediatric population is summarized in the sections on pJIA and \nsJIA below.  In general, the ADRs in pJIA and sJIA patients were similar in type to those seen in RA \npatients, see section 4.8.  \n \nADRs in the pJIA and sJIA patients treated with tocilizumab are listed in the Table 2 and presented by \nMedDRA system organ class. The corresponding frequency category for each ADR is based on the \nfollowing convention:  very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) or uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto <1/100). \n \nTable 2:  List of ADRs occurring in clinical trial patients with sJIA or pJIA receiving tocilizumab as \nmonotherapy or in combination with MTX. \n \nMedDRA SOC Preferrred term (PT) Frequency \nInfections and Infestations Very Common Common Uncommon \n Upper Respiratory \n\nTract Infections  \npJIA, sJIA   \n\n Nasopharyngitis pJIA, sJIA   \nGastrointestinal Disorders    \n Nausea  pJIA  \n Diarrhea  pJIA, sJIA  \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\n   \n\n Infusion related \nreactions \n\n pJIA1, sJIA2  \n\nNervous system disorders    \n Headache pJIA sJIA  \nInvestigations    \n Hepatic transaminases \n\nincreased \n pJIA  \n\n Decrease in neutrophil \ncount \n\nsJIA pJIA  \n\n Platelet count decreased  sJIA pJIA \n Cholesterol increased  sJIA pJIA \n1.

Infusion related reaction events in sJIA patients included but were not limited to rash, urticaria, diarrhoea, epigastric \n\ndiscomfort, arthralgia and headache \n \npJIA Patients \nThe safety profile of intravenous RoActemra in pJIA has been studied in 188 patients from 2 to 17 \nyears of age. The total patient exposure was 184.4 patient years. The frequency of ADRs in pJIA \npatients can be found in Table 2. The types of ADRs in pJIA patients were similar to those seen in RA \nand sJIA patients, see section 4.8. When compared to the adult RA population, events of \nnasopharyngitis, headache, nausea, and decreased neutrophil count were more frequently reported in \nthe pJIA population. Events of cholesterol increased were less frequently reported in the pJIA \npopulation than in the adult RA population.  \n \nInfections \nThe rate of infections in the tocilizumab all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The \nmost common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate of \nserious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing <30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg \ntocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg \ntocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was \nalso numerically higher in patients weighing <30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21.4%) \ncompared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (7.6%). \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nInfusion Reactions \nIn pJIA patients, infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 \nhours of an infusion. In the tocilizumab all exposure population, 11 patients (5.9%) experienced \ninfusion reactions during the infusion and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of \nan infusion. The most common events occurring during infusion were headache, nausea and \nhypotension and within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse \ndrug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen \nin RA and sJIA patients, see section 4.8.  \n \nNo clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment \ndiscontinuation were reported. \n \nImmunogenicity \nOne patient in the 10 mg/kg < 30kg group developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies without \ndeveloping a hypersensitivity reaction and subsequently withdrew from the study.     \n \nNeutrophils \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, a decrease in \nneutrophil count below 1 × 109/L occurred in 3.7% of patients. \n \nPlatelets \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, 1% of patients had a \ndecrease in platelet count to ≤ 50 × 103/µL without associated bleeding events. \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, elevation in ALT or \nAST ≥ 3xULN occurred in 3.7% and <1% of patients, respectively. \n \nLipid parameters \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the intravenous RoActemra study WA19977 3.4% and 10.4% \nof patients experienced a post-baseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL and \ntotal cholesterol value to ≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during the study treatment, respectively. \n \nsJIA Patients \nThe safety profile of intravenous RoActemra in sJIA has been studied in 112 patients from 2 to 17 \nyears of age. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled phase, 75 patients received treatment with \ntocilizumab (8 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of \nswitching to RoActemra, due to disease worsening, patients were treated in the open label extension \nphase. \n \nIn general, the ADRs in sJIA patients were similar in type to those seen in RA patients, see section \n4.8. The frequency of ADRs in sJIA patients can be found in Table 2. When compared to the adult RA \npopulation, patients with sJIA experienced a higher frequency of nasopharyngitis, decrease in \nneutrophil counts, hepatic transaminases increased, and diarrhea. Events of cholesterol increased were \nless frequently reported in the sJIA population than in the adult RA population. \n \nInfections \nIn the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the intravenous RoActemra group was \n344.7 per 100 patient years and 287.0 per 100 patient years in the placebo group. In the open label \nextension phase (Part II), the overall rate of infections remained similar at 306.6 per 100 patient years. \n \nIn the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the intravenous RoActemra group \nwas 11.5 per 100 patient years. At one year in the open label extension phase the overall rate of \nserious infections remained stable at 11.3 per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections were \nsimilar to those seen in RA patients with the addition of varicella and otitis media. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nInfusion Reactions \nInfusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. \nIn the 12 week controlled phase, 4% of patients from the tocilizumab group experienced events \noccurring during infusion. One event (angioedema) was considered serious and life-threatening, and \nthe patient was discontinued from study treatment. \n \nIn the 12 week controlled phase, 16% of patients in the tocilizumab group and 5.4% of patients in the \nplacebo group experienced an event within 24 hours of infusion. In the tocilizumab group, the events \nincluded, but were not limited to rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and \nheadache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered serious. \n \nClinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment \ndiscontinuation, were reported in 1 out of 112 patients (< 1%) treated with tocilizumab during the \ncontrolled and up to and including the open label clinical trial. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAll 112 patients were tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two patients developed \npositive anti-tocilizumab antibodies with one of these patients having a hypersensitivity reaction \nleading to withdrawal. The incidence of anti-tocilizumab antibody formation might be underestimated \nbecause of interference of tocilizumab with the assay and higher drug concentration observed in \nchildren compared to adults. \n \nNeutrophils \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, a decrease in neutrophil counts \nbelow 1 x 109/l occurred in 7% of patients in the tocilizumab group, and no decreases in the placebo \ngroup. \n \nIn the open label extension phase, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 109/l, occurred in 15% of \nthe tocilizumab group.  \n \nPlatelets \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, 3% of patients in the placebo \ngroup and 1% in the tocilizumab group had a decrease in platelet count to ≤ 100 x 103/µl. \n \nIn the open label extension phase, decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 103/µl, occurred in 3% of \npatients in the tocilizumab group, without associated bleeding events. \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x \nULN occurred in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively, in the tocilizumab group, and 0% in the placebo \ngroup. \n \nIn the open label extension phase, elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 12% and 4% of \npatients, respectively, in the tocilizumab group. \n \nImmunoglobulin G \nIgG levels decrease during therapy. A decrease to the lower limit of normal occurred in 15 patients at \nsome point in the study. \n \nLipid parameters \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase (study WA18221), 13.4% and \n33.3% of patients experienced a post-baseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL \nand total cholesterol value to ≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during study treatment, respectively. \n \nIn the open label extension phase (study WA18221), 13.2% and 27.7% of patients experienced a post-\nbaseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to \n≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during study treatment, respectively.  \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nCRS Patients \nThe safety of tocilizumab in CRS has been evaluated in a retrospective analysis of data from clinical \ntrials, where 51 patients were treated with intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients less \nthan 30 kg) with or without additional high-dose corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CAR T-\ncell-induced CRS. A median of 1 dose of tocilizumab (range, 1-4 doses) was administered.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorization of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are limited data available on overdose with RoActemra. One case of accidental overdose was \nreported in which a patient with multiple myeloma received a single dose of 40 mg/kg. No adverse \nreactions were observed.  \n \nNo serious adverse reactions were observed in healthy volunteers who received a single dose up to \n28 mg/kg, although dose limiting neutropenia was observed. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo case of an overdose in the paediatric population has been observed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors; ATC code: L04AC07. \n \nMechanism of action \nTocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and \nmIL-6R). Tocilizumab has been shown to inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. IL-6 is a \npleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, \nmonocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 is involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell \nactivation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, induction of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis \nand stimulation of haemopoiesis. IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases including \ninflammatory diseases, osteoporosis and neoplasia.  \n \nRA Patients \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn clinical studies with tocilizumab, rapid decreases in CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), \nserum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen were observed. Consistent with the effect on acute phase \nreactants, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with reduction in platelet count within the normal \nrange. Increases in haemoglobin levels were observed, through tocilizumab decreasing the IL-6 driven \neffects on hepcidin production to increase iron availability. In tocilizumab-treated patients, decreases \nin the levels of CRP to within normal ranges were seen as early as week 2, with decreases maintained \nwhile on treatment. \n \nIn healthy subjects administered tocilizumab in doses from 2 to 28 mg/kg, absolute neutrophil counts \ndecreased to their lowest 3 to 5 days following administration. Thereafter, neutrophils recovered \ntowards baseline in a dose dependent manner. Rheumatoid arthritis patients demonstrated a similar \npattern of absolute neutrophil counts following tocilizumab administration (see section 4.8). \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n21 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \nThe efficacy of tocilizumab in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA was assessed in five \nrandomised, double-blind, multi-centre studies. Studies I-V enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with \nactive RA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and who had \nat least eight tender and six swollen joints at baseline.  \n \nIn Study I, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every four weeks as monotherapy. In Studies \nII, III and V, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every four weeks in combination with MTX \nvs. placebo and MTX. In Study IV, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every 4 weeks in \ncombination with other DMARDs vs. placebo and other DMARDs. The primary endpoint for each of \nthe five studies was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.  \n \nStudy I evaluated 673 patients who had not been treated with MTX within six months prior to \nrandomisation and who had not discontinued previous MTX treatment as a result of clinically \nimportant toxic effects or lack of response. The majority (67%) of patients were MTX-naïve. Doses of \n8 mg/kg of tocilizumab were given every four weeks as monotherapy. The comparator group was \nweekly MTX (dose titrated from 7.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg weekly over an eight week period).  \n \nStudy II, a two year study with planned analyses at week 24, week 52 and week 104, evaluated 1,196 \npatients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab or \nplacebo were given every four weeks as blinded therapy for 52 weeks in combination with stable \nMTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly). After week 52, all patients could receive open-label treatment with \ntocilizumab 8 mg/kg. Of the patients who completed the study who were originally randomised to \nplacebo + MTX, 86% received open-label tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in year 2. The primary endpoint at \nweek 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At week 52 and week 104 \nthe co-primary endpoints were prevention of joint damage and improvement in physical function. \n \nStudy III evaluated 623 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or \n8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks, in combination with stable MTX (10 mg \nto 25 mg weekly).  \n \nStudy IV evaluated 1,220 patients who had an inadequate response to their existing rheumatologic \ntherapy, including one or more DMARDs. Doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every \nfour weeks in combination with stable DMARDs.  \n \nStudy V evaluated 499 patients who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or \nmore TNF antagonist therapies. The TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued prior to randomisation. \nDoses of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks in combination with stable \nMTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly).  \n \nClinical response \nIn all studies, patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg had statistically significant higher ACR 20, \n50, 70 response rates at 6 months compared to control (Table 3). In study I, superiority of tocilizumab \n8 mg/kg was demonstrated against the active comparator MTX. \n \nThe treatment effect was similar in patients independent of rheumatoid factor status, age, gender, race, \nnumber of prior treatments or disease status. Time to onset was rapid (as early as week 2) and the \nmagnitude of response continued to improve with duration of treatment. Continued durable responses \nwere seen for over 3 years in the open label extension studies I-V.  \n \nIn patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg, significant improvements were noted on all individual \ncomponents of the ACR response including: tender and swollen joint counts; patients and physician \nglobal assessment; disability index scores; pain assessment and CRP compared to patients receiving \nplacebo plus MTX or other DMARDs in all studies.  \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPatients in studies I – V had a mean Disease Activity Score (DAS28) of 6.5–6.8 at baseline. \nSignificant reduction in DAS28 from baseline (mean improvement) of 3.1–3.4 were observed in \ntocilizumab-treated patients compared to control patients (1.3-2.1). The proportion of patients \nachieving a DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) was significantly higher in patients receiving \ntocilizumab (28–34%) compared to 1–12% of control patients at 24 weeks. In study II, 65% of patients \nachieved a DAS28 < 2.6 at week 104 compared to 48% at 52 weeks and 33% of patients at week 24. \n \nIn a pooled analysis of studies II, III and IV, the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50 and \n70 response was significantly higher (59% vs. 50%, 37% vs. 27%, 18% vs. 11%, respectively) in the \ntocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD vs. the tocilizumab 4 mg/kg plus DMARD group (p< 0.03). \nSimilarly the proportion of patients achieving a DAS28 remission (DAS28 < 2.6) was significantly \nhigher (31% vs. 16% respectively) in patients receiving tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD than in \npatients receiving tocilizumab 4 mg/kg plus DMARD (p< 0.0001). \n \nTable 3.

Inhibition of joint structural damage was shown with \nsignificantly less radiographic progression in patients receiving tocilizumab compared to control \n(Table 4). \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIn the open-label extension of Study II the inhibition of progression of structural joint damage in \ntocilizumab plus MTX-treated patients was maintained in the second year of treatment. The mean \nchange from baseline at week 104 in total Sharp-Genant score was significantly lower for patients \nrandomised to tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX (p<0.0001) compared with patients who were \nrandomised to placebo plus MTX.   \n \nTable 4.

This remained \nconsistent following 2 years of treatment (83%; n=353). Ninety three percent (93%; n=271) of patients \nhad no progression between week 52 and week 104. \n \nHealth-related and quality of life outcomes \nTocilizumab-treated patients reported an improvement in all patient-reported outcomes (Health \nAssessment Questionnaire Disability Index - HAQ-DI), Short Form-36 and Functional Assessment of \nChronic Illness Therapy questionnaires. Statistically significant improvements in HAQ-DI scores were \nobserved in patients treated with RoActemra compared with patients treated with DMARDs. During \nthe open-label period of Study II, the improvement in physical function has been maintained for up to \n2 years. At Week 52, the mean change in HAQ-DI was -0.58 in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX \ngroup compared with -0.39 in the placebo + MTX group. The mean change in HAQ-DI was \nmaintained at Week 104 in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX group (-0.61). \n \nHaemoglobin levels  \nStatistically significant improvements in haemoglobin levels were observed with tocilizumab \ncompared with DMARDs (p< 0.0001) at week 24. Mean haemoglobin levels increased by week 2 and \nremained within normal range through to week 24.  \n \nTocilizumab versus adalimumab in monotherapy \nStudy VI (WA19924), a 24 week double-blinded study that compared tocilizumab monotherapy with \nadalimumab monotherapy, evaluated 326 patients with RA who were intolerant of MTX or where \ncontinued treatment with MTX was considered inappropriate (including MTX inadequate responders). \nPatients in the tocilizumab arm received an intravenous (IV) infusion of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) every 4 \nweeks (q4w) and a subcutaneous (SC) placebo injection every 2 weeks (q2w). Patients in the \nadalimumab arm received an adalimumab SC injection (40 mg) q2w plus an IV placebo infusion q4w. \nA statistically significant superior treatment effect was seen in favour of tocilizumab over adalimumab \nin control of disease activity from baseline to week 24 for the primary endpoint of change in DAS28 \nand for all secondary endpoints (Table 5). \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nTable 5: Efficacy Results for Study VI (WA19924) \n \n\n \n\nADA + Placebo (IV) \n\nN = 162 \n\nTCZ + Placebo (SC) \n\nN = 163 p-value(a) \n\nPrimary Endpoint - Mean Change from baseline at Week 24 \n\nDAS28 (adjusted mean)  -1.8 -3.3   \n\nDifference in adjusted mean (95% CI) -1.5 (-1.8, -1.1) <0.0001 \n\nSecondary Endpoints - Percentage of Responders at Week 24 (b) \n\nDAS28 < 2.6, n (%) 17 (10.5) 65 (39.9) <0.0001 \n\nDAS28 ≤ 3.2, n (%)  32 (19.8)  84 (51.5) <0.0001 \n\nACR20 response, n (%) 80 (49.4) 106 (65.0) 0.0038 \n\nACR50 response, n (%) 45 (27.8) 77 (47.2) 0.0002 \n\nACR70 response, n (%) 29 (17.9) 53 (32.5) 0.0023 \nap value is adjusted for region and duration of RA for all endpoints and additionally baseline value for all continuous  \nendpoints. \nb Non-responder Imputation used for missing data. Multiplicity controlled using Bonferroni-Holm Procedure \n \nThe overall clinical adverse event profile was similar between tocilizumab and adalimumab. The \nproportion of patients with serious adverse events was balanced between the treatment groups \n(tocilizumab 11.7% vs. adalimumab 9.9%). The types of adverse drug reactions in the tocilizumab arm \nwere consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab and adverse drug reactions were reported \nat a similar frequency compared with Table 1. A higher incidence of infections and infestations was \nreported in the tocilizumab arm (48% vs. 42%), with no difference in the incidence of serious \ninfections (3.1%). Both study treatments induced the same pattern of changes in laboratory safety \nparameters (decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts, increases in ALT, AST and lipids), however, \nthe magnitude of change and the frequency of marked abnormalities was higher with tocilizumab \ncompared with adalimumab. Four (2.5%) patients in the tocilizumab arm and two (1.2%) patients in \nthe adalimumab arm experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decreases.  Eleven (6.8%) \npatients in the tocilizumab arm and five (3.1%) patients in the adalimumab arm experienced ALT \nincreases of CTC grade 2 or higher.  The mean LDL increase from baseline was 0.64 mmol/L \n(25 mg/dL) for patients in the tocilizumab arm and 0.19 mmol/L (7 mg/dL) for patients in the \nadalimumab arm.  The safety observed in the tocilizumab arm was consistent with the known safety \nprofile of tocilizumab and no new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1).  \n \nMTX naïve, Early RA \nStudy VII (WA19926), a 2 year study with the planned primary analysis at week 52 evaluated 1162 \nMTX-naïve adult patients with moderate to severe, active early RA (mean disease duration ≤ 6 \nmonths). Approximately 20% of patients had received prior treatment with DMARDs other than \nMTX. This study evaluated the efficacy of IV tocilizumab 4 or 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks/MTX \ncombination therapy, IV tocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy and MTX monotherapy in reducing the \nsigns and symptoms and rate of progression of joint damage for 104 weeks. The primary endpoint was \nthe proportion of patients achieving DAS28 remission (DAS28 < 2.6) at week 24. A significantly \nhigher proportion of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + MTX and tocilizumab monotherapy groups \nmet the primary endpoint compared with MTX alone. The tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + MTX group also \nshowed statistically significant results across the key secondary endpoints.

Patients included in the trial had a \ntotal disease duration of at least 6 months and active disease but were not experiencing an acute flare \nrequiring corticosteroid doses of more than 0.5 mg/kg prednisone equivalent. Efficacy for the \ntreatment of macrophage activation syndrome has not been investigated. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPatients (treated with or without MTX) were randomised (tocilizumab:placebo = 2:1) to one of two \ntreatment groups, 75 patients received tocilizumab infusions every two weeks, either 8 mg/kg for \npatients ≥ 30 kg or 12 mg/kg for patients < 30 kg and 37 patients were assigned to receiving placebo \ninfusions every two weeks. Corticosteroid tapering was permitted from week six for patients who \nachieved a JIA ACR70 response. After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, \npatients were treated in the open label phase at weight appropriate dosing. \n \nClinical response \nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least 30% improvement in the JIA ACR \ncore set (JIA ACR30 response) at week 12 and absence of fever (no temperature recording ≥ 37.5°C in \nthe preceding 7 days). Eighty five percent (64/75) of tocilizumab treated patients and 24.3% (9/37) of \nplacebo treated patients achieved this endpoint. These proportions were highly significantly different \n(p<0.0001). \n \nThe percent of patients achieving JIA ACR 30, 50, 70 and 90 responses are shown in Table 7. \n \nTable 7.

Seventeen \n(24%) tocilizumab treated patients versus 1 (3%) placebo patient were able to reduce their dose of \ncorticosteroid by at least 20% without experiencing a subsequent JIA ACR30 flare or occurrence of \nsystemic symptoms to week 12 (p=0.028). Reductions in corticosteroids continued, with 44 patients \noff oral corticosteroids at week 44, while maintaining JIA ACR responses. \n \nHealth related and quality of life outcomes \nAt week 12, the proportion of tocilizumab treated patients showing a minimally clinically important \nimprovement in the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (defined as an \nindividual total score decrease of ≥ 0.13) was significantly higher than in placebo treated patients, 77% \nversus 19% (p<0.0001).  \n \nLaboratory Parameters \nFifty out of seventy five (67%) tocilizumab treated patients had a haemoglobin < LLN at baseline. \nForty (80%) of these patients had an increase in their haemoglobin to within the normal range at week \n12, in comparison to 2 out of 29 (7%) of placebo treated patients with haemoglobin < LLN at baseline \n(p<0.0001).  \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\npJIA Patients \nClinical efficacy \nThe efficacy of tocilizumab was assessed in a three-part study WA19977 including an open-label \nextension in children with active pJIA. Part I consisted of a 16-week active tocilizumab treatment \nlead-in period (n=188) followed by Part II, a 24-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled \nwithdrawal period (n=163), followed by Part III, a 64-week open-label period. In Part 1, eligible \npatients ≥ 30 kg received tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for 4 doses. Patients < 30 kg were \nrandomized 1:1 to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for 4 doses. \nPatients who completed Part I of the study and achieved at least a JIA ACR30 response at week 16 \ncompared to baseline were eligible to enter the blinded withdrawal period (Part II) of the study. In \nPart II, patients were randomized to tocilizumab (same dose received in Part I) or placebo in a 1:1 \nratio, stratified by concurrent MTX use and concurrent corticosteroid use. Each patient continued in \nPart II of the study until Week 40 or until the patient satisfied JIA ACR30 flare criteria (relative to \nWeek 16) and qualified for escape to tocilizumab therapy (same dose received in Part I).   \n \nClinical response \nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a JIA ACR30 flare at week 40 relative to \nweek 16. Forty eight percent (48.1%, 39/81) of the patients treated with placebo flared compared with \n25.6% (21/82) of tocilizumab treated patients. These proportions were statistically significantly \ndifferent (p=0.0024).  \n \nAt the conclusion of Part I, JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were 89.4%, 83.0%, 62.2%, and 26.1%, \nrespectively. \n \nDuring the withdrawal phase (Part II), the percentage of patients achieving JIA ACR 30, 50, and 70 \nresponses at Week 40 relative to baseline are shown in Table 8. In this statistical analysis, patients \nwho flared (and escaped to TCZ) during Part II or who withdrew, were classified as non-responders.  \nAn additional analyses of JIA ACR responses, considering observed data at Week 40, regardless of \nflare status, showed that by Week 40, 95.1% of patients who had received continuous TCZ therapy, \nhad achieved JIA ACR30 or higher. \n \nTable 8.

Evaluable patients had been treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg \nfor patients < 30 kg) with or without additional high-dose corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening \nCRS; only the first episode of CRS was included in the analysis. The efficacy population for the \ntisagenlecleucel cohort included 28 males and 23 females (total 51 patients) of median age 17 years \n(range, 3–68 years). The median time from start of CRS to first dose of tocilizumab was 3 days (range, \n0–18 days). Resolution of CRS was defined as lack of fever and off vasopressors for at least 24 hours. \nPatients were considered responders if CRS resolved within 14 days of the first dose of tocilizumab, if \nno more than 2 doses of RoActemra were needed, and no drugs other than RoActemra and \ncorticosteroids were used for treatment. Thirty-nine patients (76.5%; 95% CI: 62.5%–87.2%) achieved \na response. In an independent cohort of 15 patients (range: 9–75 years old) with axicabtagene \nciloleucel-induced CRS, 53% responded.  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nRoActemra in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of cytokine release syndrome \nassociated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nRA Patients \n \nIntravenous use \nThe pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on \na database composed of 3552 RA patients treated with a one-hour infusion of 4 or 8 mg/kg \ntocilizumab every 4 weeks for 24 weeks or with 162 mg tocilizumab given subcutaneously either once \na week or every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nThe following parameters (predicted mean ± SD) were estimated for a dose of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab \ngiven every 4 weeks: steady-state area under curve (AUC) = 38000 ± 13000 h µg/mL, trough \nconcentration (Cmin) = 15.9 ± 13.1 µg/mL and maximum concentration (Cmax) = 182 ± 50.4 µg/mL, \nand the accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax were small, 1.32 and 1.09, respectively. The \naccumulation ratio was higher for Cmin (2.49), which was expected based on the non-linear clearance \ncontribution at lower concentrations. Steady-state was reached following the first administration for \nCmax and after 8 and 20 weeks for AUC and Cmin, respectively. Tocilizumab AUC, Cmin and Cmax \nincreased with increase of body weight. At body weight ≥ 100 kg, the predicted mean (± SD) steady-\nstate AUC, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 50000 ± 16800 μg•h/mL, 24.4 ± 17.5 μg/mL, and 226 ± \n50.3 μg/mL, respectively, which are higher than mean exposure values for the patient population (i.e. \nall body weights) reported above. The dose-response curve for tocilizumab flattens at higher exposure, \n\n\n\n29 \n\nresulting in smaller efficacy gains for each incremental increase in tocilizumab concentration such that \nclinically meaningful increases in efficacy were not demonstrated in patients treated with > 800 mg of \ntocilizumab. Therefore, tocilizumab doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nIn RA patients the central volume of distribution was 3.72, the peripheral volume of distribution was \n3.35 resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.07.  \n \nElimination \nFollowing intravenous administration, tocilizumab undergoes biphasic elimination from the \ncirculation. The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the \nlinear and non-linear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population \npharmacokinetic analysis and was 9.5 mL/h. The concentration-dependent non-linear clearance plays a \nmajor role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the non-linear clearance pathway is saturated, at \nhigher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance.  \n \nThe t1/2 of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent. At steady-state following a dose of 8 mg/kg \nevery 4 weeks, the effective t1/2 decreased with decreasing concentrations within a dosing interval \nfrom 18 days to 6 days. \n \nLinearity \nPharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab did not change with time. A more than dose-proportional \nincrease in the AUC and Cmin was observed for doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Cmax increased \ndose-proportionally. At steady-state, predicted AUC and Cmin were 3.2 and 30 fold higher at 8 mg/kg \nas compared to 4 mg/kg, respectively. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment: No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \ntocilizumab has been conducted. Most of the patients in the population pharmacokinetic analysis had \nnormal renal function or mild renal impairment. Mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance based on \nCockcroft-Gault < 80 mL/min and ≥ 50 mL/min) did not impact the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. \n \nHepatic impairment: No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \ntocilizumab has been conducted.  \n \nAge, gender and ethnicity: Population pharmacokinetic analyses in RA patients, showed that age, \ngender and ethnic origin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab.  \n \nsJIA Patients:  \nThe pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on \na database composed of 140 sJIA patients treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients with a body \nweight ≥ 30 kg ) 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients with a body weight < 30 kg), 162 mg SC every \nweek (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), 162 mg SC every 10 days or every 2 weeks (patients weighing \nbelow 30 kg).  \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nTable 10.

The linear \nclearance estimated as a parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, was 5.7 mL/h. \n \nThe half life of tocilizumab in sJIA patients is up to 16 days for the two body weight categories \n(8 mg/kg for body weight ≥ 30 kg or 12 mg/kg for body weight < 30 kg) at week 12. \n \npJIA Patients:  \nThe pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab in pJIA patients was characterized by a population \npharmacokinetic analysis which included 237 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 4 \nweeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg ), 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), \n162 mg SC every 2 weeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), or 162 mg SC every 3 weeks (patients \nweighing below 30 kg).  \n \nTable 11.

This data does not suggest a relevant risk for cancer initiation and \nprogression under tocilizumab treatment. Additionally, proliferative lesions were not observed in a \n6-month chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys or in IL-6 deficient mice.  \n \nAvailable non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under tocilizumab treatment. Effects on \nendocrine active and reproductive system organs were not observed in a chronic cynomolgus monkey \ntoxicity study and reproductive performance was not affected in IL-6 deficient mice. Tocilizumab \nadministered to cynomolgus monkeys during early gestation, was observed to have no direct or \nindirect harmful effect on pregnancy or embryonal-foetal development. However, a slight increase in \nabortion/embryonal-foetal death was observed with high systemic exposure (> 100 x human exposure) \nin the 50 mg/kg/day high-dose group compared to placebo and other low-dose groups. Although IL-6 \ndoes not seem to be a critical cytokine for foetal growth or the immunological control of the \nmaternal/foetal interface, a relation of this finding to tocilizumab cannot be excluded. \n \nTreatment with a murine analogue did not exert toxicity in juvenile mice. In particular, there was no \nimpairment of skeletal growth, immune function and sexual maturation. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRoActemra 162 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 162 mg of tocilizumab in 0.9 mL. \n \nTocilizumab is a recombinant humanized, anti-human monoclonal antibody of the \nimmunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) sub-class directed against soluble and membrane-bound interleukin 6 \nreceptors. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe.  \n \nA colourless to slightly yellowish solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRoActemra, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for \n \n\n• the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults not \npreviously treated with MTX. \n\n• the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have either responded \ninadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-\nmodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.  \n\n \nIn these patients, RoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where \ncontinued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.  \n \nRoActemra has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray \nand to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \nRoActemra is indicated for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in \npatients 1 year of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs \nand systemic corticosteroids. RoActemra can be given as monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX \nor where treatment with MTX is inappropriate) or in combination with MTX.  \n \nRoActemra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile \nidiopathic polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in \npatients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX.  \nRoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment \nwith MTX is inappropriate. \n \nRoActemra is indicated for the treatment of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) in adult patients. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTocilizumab SC formulation is administered with a single-use PFS+NSD.  Treatment should be \ninitiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA and \n/ or GCA. The first injection should be performed under the supervision of a qualified health care \nprofessional. A patient or parent/guardian can self-inject RoActemra only if the physician determines \nthat it is appropriate and the patient or parent/guardian agrees to medical follow-up as necessary and \nhas been trained in proper injection technique.  \n \nPatients who transition from tocilizumab IV therapy to SC administration should administer the first \nSC dose at the time of the next scheduled IV dose under the supervision of a qualified health care \nprofessional. \n \nAll patients treated with RoActemra should be given the Patient Alert Card.  \n \nSuitability of the patient or parent/guardian for subcutaneous home use should be assessed and patients \nor parent/guardian instructed to inform a healthcare professional before administering the next dose if \nthey experience symptoms of an allergic reaction. Patients should seek immediate medical attention if \ndeveloping symptoms of serious allergic reactions (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nRA \nThe recommended posology is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week. \n \nLimited information is available regarding switching patients from RoActemra intravenous \nformulation to RoActemra subcutaneous fixed dose formulation. The once every week dosing interval \nshould be followed. \n \nPatients transitioning from intravenous to subcutaneous formulation should administer their first \nsubcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose under the supervision of a qualified \nhealthcare professional. \n \nGCA \nThe recommended posology is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week in combination with a tapering \ncourse of glucocorticoids. RoActemra can be used alone following discontinuation of glucocorticoids. \nRoActemra monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of acute relapses (see 4.4). \n \nBased upon the chronic nature of GCA, treatment beyond 52 weeks should be guided by disease \nactivity, physician discretion, and patient choice. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nRA and GCA \nDose adjustments due to laboratory abnormalities (see section 4.4).  \n \n• Liver enzyme abnormalities \n \nLaboratory Value Action \n\n> 1 to 3 x Upper \nLimit of Normal \n(ULN) \n\nDose modify concomitant DMARDs (RA) or immunomodulatory agents (GCA) \nif appropriate. \n\nFor persistent increases in this range, reduce RoActemra dose frequency to \nevery other week injection or interrupt RoActemra until alanine \naminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have normalised. \n \nRestart with weekly or every other week injection, as clinically appropriate. \n\n> 3 to 5 x ULN Interrupt RoActemra dosing until < 3 x ULN and follow recommendations \nabove for > 1 to 3 x ULN. \n\nFor persistent increases > 3 x ULN (confirmed by repeat testing, see 4.4.), \ndiscontinue RoActemra. \n\n> 5 x ULN Discontinue RoActemra. \n\n \n• Low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \n \nIn patients not previously treated with RoActemra, initiation is not recommended in patients with an \nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2 x 109/L \n \nLaboratory Value \n(cells x 109/ L ) \n\nAction \n\nANC > 1  Maintain dose. \n\nANC 0.5 to 1 Interrupt RoActemra dosing. \n\nWhen ANC increases > 1 x 109/ L resume RoActemra dosing every other week \nand increase to every week injection, as clinically appropriate. \n\nANC < 0.5 Discontinue RoActemra. \n\n \n• Low platelet count \n \nLaboratory Value \n(cells x 103/ μL) \n\nAction \n\n50 to 100 Interrupt RoActemra dosing. \n\nWhen platelet count > 100 x 103/ μL resume RoActemra dosing every other \nweek and increase to every week injection as clinically appropriate. \n\n< 50 Discontinue RoActemra. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nRA and GCA  \nMissed dose \nIf a patient misses a subcutaneous weekly injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled dose, \nhe/she should be instructed to take the missed dose on the next scheduled day. If a patient misses a \nsubcutaneous once every other week injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled dose, \nhe/she should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and the next dose on the next \nscheduled day.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly: \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients > 65 years of age.  \n \nRenal impairment:  \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. RoActemra has \nnot been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). Renal function should be \nmonitored closely in these patients.  \n \nHepatic impairment:  \nRoActemra has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose \nrecommendations can be made.  \n \nPaediatric patients  \nThe safety and efficacy of RoActemra subcutaneous formulation in children from birth to less than 1 \nyear have not been established. No data are available.  \n \nA change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient’s body weight over time.  \nRoActemra can be used alone or in combination with MTX. \n \nsJIA Patients \nThe recommended posology in patients above 1 year of age is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week \nin patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or subcutaneous 162 mg once every 2 weeks in \npatients weighing less than 30 kg.  \nPatients must have a minimum body weight of 10 kg when receiving RoActemra subcutaneously. \n \npJIA Patients: \nThe recommended posology in patients above 2 years of age is subcutaneous 162 mg once every 2 \nweeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or subcutaneous 162 mg once every 3 weeks \nin patients weighing less than 30 kg.  \n \nDose adjustments due to laboratory abnormalities (sJIA and pJIA)  \n \nIf appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other medications should be modified or dosing \nstopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the clinical situation has been evaluated. As there are \nmany co-morbid conditions that may effect laboratory values in sJIA or pJIA, the decision to \ndiscontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical assessment of \nthe individual patient. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n• Liver enzyme abnormalities \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n\nAction \n\n> 1 to 3 x ULN Modify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nFor persistent increases in this range, interrupt RoActemra until \nALT/AST have normalized.  \n\n> 3 x ULN to 5x \nULN \n\n \n\nModify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing until < 3x ULN and follow \nrecommendations above for >1 to 3x ULN \n\n \n\n> 5x ULN Discontinue RoActemra.  \n\nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in sJIA or pJIA for a \nlaboratory abnormality should be based on the medical \nassessment of the individual patient. \n\n \n• Low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n(cells x \n109/ L ) \n\nAction \n\nANC > 1  Maintain dose \n\nANC 0.5 to \n1 \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing \n\nWhen ANC increases to > 1 x 109/ L resume RoActemra  \n\nANC < 0.5 Discontinue RoActemra \n\nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in sJIA or pJIA for a laboratory \nabnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the individual \npatient. \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n• Low platelet count  \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n\n(cells x 103/µL) \n\nAction \n\n50 to 100 Modify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing \n\nWhen platelet count is > 100 x 103/µl resume RoActemra  \n\n \n\n< 50  Discontinue RoActemra.  \n\nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in sJIA or pJIA for a \nlaboratory abnormality should be based on the medical \nassessment of the individual patient. \n\n \nReduction of tocilizumab dosing frequency due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in \nsJIA or pJIA patients. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of RoActemra subcutaneous formulation in children with conditions other than \nsJIA or pJIA have not been established.  \n \nAvailable data with the IV formulation suggest that clinical improvement is observed within 12 weeks \nof initiation of treatment with RoActemra. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a \npatient exhibiting no improvement within this timeframe. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a sJIA patient misses a subcutaneous weekly injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled \ndose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose on the next scheduled day. If a patient misses \na subcutaneous once every 2 week injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she \nshould be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and the next dose on the next scheduled day.  \n \nIf a pJIA patient misses a subcutaneous injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled dose, \nhe/she should take the missed dose as soon as they remember and take the next dose at the regular \nscheduled time. If a patient misses a subcutaneous injection of RoActemra by more than 7 days of the \nscheduled dose or is unsure when to inject RoActemra, call the doctor or pharmacist. \n \nMethod of administration \nRoActemra is for subcutaneous use.  \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with RoActemra if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate. The total content (0.9 mL) of the pre-filled syringe should be \nadministered as a subcutaneous injection. The recommended injection sites (abdomen, thigh and upper \narm) should be rotated and injections should never be given into moles, scars, or areas where the skin \nis tender, bruised, red, hard, or not intact. \n \nThe pre-filled syringe should not be shaken.  \n \nComprehensive instructions for the administration of RoActemra in a pre-filled syringe are given in \nthe package leaflet, see section 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRoActemra subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration.  \n \nRoActemra subcutaneous formulation is not intended to be given to children with sJIA weighing less \nthan 10 kg. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections  \nSerious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive \nagents including RoActemra (see section 4.8, Undesirable effects). RoActemra treatment must not be \ninitiated in patients with active infections (see section 4.3). Administration of RoActemra should be \ninterrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled (see section 4.8). \nHealthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use of RoActemra in patients \nwith a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions (e.g.) diverticulitis, \ndiabetes and interstitial lung disease which may predispose patients to infections. \n \nVigilance for the timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving \nimmunosuppressive agents such as RoActemra as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be \nlessened, due to suppression of the acute phase reactants. The effects of tocilizumab on C-reactive \nprotein (CRP), neutrophils and signs and symptoms of infection should be considered when evaluating \na patient for a potential infection. Patients (which includes younger children with sJIA or pJIA who \nmay be less able to communicate their symptoms) and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients, \nshould be instructed to contact their healthcare professional immediately when any symptoms \nsuggesting infection appear, in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment. \n \nTuberculosis \nAs recommended for other biological treatments, all patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis \n(TB) infection prior to starting RoActemra therapy. Patients with latent TB should be treated with \nstandard anti-mycobacterial therapy before initiating RoActemra. Prescribers are reminded of the risk \nof false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood test results, especially in patients \nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nPatients and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients should be advised to seek medical advice if \nsigns/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade (fever) suggestive of a \ntuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with RoActemra.  \n \nViral reactivation \nViral reactivation (e.g. hepatitis B virus) has been reported with biologic therapies for RA. In clinical \nstudies with RoActemra, patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded. \n \nComplications of diverticulitis \nEvents of diverticular perforations as complications of diverticulitis have been reported uncommonly \nin patients treated with RoActemra (see section 4.8). RoActemra should be used with caution in \npatients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or diverticulitis. Patients presenting with \nsymptoms potentially indicative of complicated diverticulitis, such as abdominal pain, haemorrhage \nand/or unexplained change in bowel habits with fever should be evaluated promptly for early \nidentification of diverticulitis which can be associated with gastrointestinal perforation. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported in association with \nRoActemra (see section 4.8). Such reactions may be more severe, and potentially fatal in patients who \nhave experienced hypersensitivity reactions during previous treatment with RoActemra even if they \nhave received premedication with steroids and antihistamines. If an anaphylactic reaction or other \nserious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of RoActemra should be stopped immediately, \nappropriate therapy initiated and tocilizumab should be permanently discontinued. \n \nActive hepatic disease and hepatic impairment \nTreatment with RoActemra, particularly when administered concomitantly with MTX, may be \nassociated with elevations in hepatic transaminases, therefore, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \nHepatotoxicity \nTransient or intermittent mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been reported \ncommonly with RoActemra treatment (see section 4.8). An increased frequency of these elevations \nwas observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) were used in combination with \nRoActemra. When clinically indicated, other liver function tests including bilirubin should be \nconsidered. \n \nSerious drug-induced liver injury, including acute liver failure, hepatitis and jaundice, have been \nobserved with RoActemra (see section 4.8). Serious hepatic injury occurred between 2 weeks to more \nthan 5 years after initiation of RoActemra. Cases of liver failure resulting in liver transplantation have \nbeen reported. Patients should be advised to immediately seek medical help if they experience signs \nand symptoms of hepatic injury.  \n \nCaution should be exercised when considering initiation of RoActemra treatment in patients with \nelevated ALT or AST > 1.5 x ULN. In patients with baseline ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, treatment is not \nrecommended. \n \nIn RA, GCA, pJIA and sJIA patients, ALT/AST should be monitored every 4 to 8 weeks for the first 6 \nmonths of treatment followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. For recommended modifications, \nincluding RoActemra discontinuation, based on transaminases levels see section 4.2. For ALT or AST \nelevations > 3–5 x ULN, RoActemra treatment should be interrupted.  \n \nHaematological abnormalities \nDecreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with tocilizumab \n8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in \npatients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist. \n \nIn patients not previously treated with RoActemra, initiation is not recommended in patients with an \nANC below 2 x 109/L. Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of RoActemra \ntreatment in patients with a low platelet count (i.e. platelet count below 100 x 103/ μL). In patients who \ndevelop an ANC < 0.5 x 109/ L or a platelet count < 50 x 103/μL, continued treatment is not \nrecommended. \n \nSevere neutropenia may be associated with an increased risk of serious infections, although there has \nbeen no clear association between decreases in neutrophils and the occurrence of serious infections in \nclinical trials with RoActemra to date.  \n \nIn RA and GCA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of \ntherapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications \nbased on ANC and platelet counts, see section 4.2. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nIn sJIA and pJIA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored at the time of the second \nadministration and thereafter according to good clinical practice (see section 4.2). \n \nLipid parameters \nElevations in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides were observed in patients treated with RoActemra (see section \n4.8). In the majority of patients, there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in total \ncholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering agents. \n \nIn all patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of \nRoActemra therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical guidelines for \nmanagement of hyperlipidaemia. \n \nNeurological disorders \nPhysicians should be vigilant for symptoms potentially indicative of new-onset central demyelinating \ndisorders. The potential for central demyelination with RoActemra is currently unknown. \n \nMalignancy \nThe risk of malignancy is increased in patients with RA. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may \nincrease the risk of malignancy. \n \nVaccinations \nLive and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with RoActemra as clinical safety \nhas not been established. In a randomized open-label study, adult RA patients treated with RoActemra \nand MTX were able to mount an effective response to both the 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide and tetanus toxoid vaccines which was comparable to the response seen in patients on \nMTX only. It is recommended that all patients particularly paediatric or elderly patients, be brought up \nto date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating \nRoActemra therapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of RoActemra therapy \nshould be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents. \n \nCardiovascular risk \nRA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and should have risk factors (e.g. \nhypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care. \n \nCombination with TNF antagonists \nThere is no experience with the use of RoActemra with TNF antagonists or other biological treatments \nfor RA patients. RoActemra is not recommended for use with other biological agents.  \n \nGCA \nRoActemra monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of acute relapses as efficacy in this \nsetting has not been established. Glucocorticoids should be given according to medical judgement and \npractice guidelines. \n \nsJIA \nMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a serious life-threatening disorder that may develop in \nsJIA patients. In clinical trials, RoActemra has not been studied in patients during an episode of active \nMAS.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nConcomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg RoActemra with 10-25 mg MTX once \nweekly had no clinically significant effect on MTX exposure. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, non-steroidal  \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on RoActemra  clearance in RA patients. In \nGCA patients, no effect of cumulative corticosteroid dose on RoActemra exposure was observed.  \n \nThe expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate \nchronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory \ntherapy, such as RoActemra, is introduced. \n \nIn vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in \nCYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. RoActemra normalises expression \nof these enzymes. \n \nIn a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following \na single dose of tocilizumab, to the level similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy \nsubjects.  \n \nWhen starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal products which are \nindividually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2 or 2C9 (e.g. methylprednisolone, \ndexamethasone, (with the possibility for oral glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome), atorvastatin, \ncalcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or \nbenzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic \neffect. Given its long elimination half-life (t1/2), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity \nmay persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after \ntreatment. \n \nPregnancy  \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of RoActemra in pregnant women. A study in animals has \nshown an increased risk of spontaneous abortion/embryo-foetal death at a high dose (see section 5.3). \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n \nRoActemra should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether tocilizumab is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of RoActemra in \nmilk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or \nto continue/discontinue therapy with RoActemra should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding to the child and the benefit of RoActemra therapy to the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAvailable non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under RoActemra treatment.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRoActemra has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8, dizziness). \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile comes from 4510 patients exposed to RoActemra in clinical trials; the majority of \nthese patients were participating in adult RA studies (n=4009), while the remaining experience comes \nfrom GCA (n=149), pJIA (n=240) and sJIA (n=112) studies. The safety profile of RoActemra across \nthese indications remains similar and undifferentiated. \n \nThe most commonly reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) were upper respiratory tract infections, \nnasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT. \n \nThe most serious ADRs were serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity \nreactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nADRs from clinical trials and/or post marketing experience with RoActemra based on spontaneous \ncase reports, literature cases and cases from non-interventional study programs are listed in Table 1 \nand are presented by MedDRA system organ class. The corresponding frequency category for each \nAR is based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) rare, (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nTable 1.

SC-I was a non-inferiority study that compared the efficacy and safety of RoActemra 162 mg \nadministered every week versus 8 mg/kg intravenous in 1262 patients with RA. All patients received \nbackground non-biologic DMARD(s). The safety and immunogenicity observed for RoActemra \nadministered subcutaneous was consistent with the known safety profile of intravenous RoActemra \nand no new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1). A higher frequency of \ninjection site reactions was observed in the subcutaneous arms compared with placebo subcutaneous \ninjections in the intravenous arms.  \n \nInjection site reactions \nDuring the 6-month controlled period, in SC-I, the frequency of injection site reactions was 10.1% \n(64/631) and 2.4% (15/631) for the subcutaneous RoActemra and the subcutaneous placebo \n(intravenous group) weekly injections, respectively. These injection site reactions (including \nerythema, pruritus, pain and haematoma) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority was \nresolved without any treatment and none necessitated drug discontinuation. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn SC-I, a total of 625 patients treated with RoActemra 162mg weekly were tested for anti-RoActemra \nantibodies in the 6 month controlled period. Five patients (0.8%) developed positive anti-RoActemra \nantibodies; of these, all developed neutralizing anti-RoActemra antibodies. One patient was tested \npositive for IgE isotype (0.2%). \n \nIn SC-II, a total of 434 patients treated with RoActemra 162mg every other week were tested for anti-\nRoActemra antibodies in the 6 month controlled period. Seven patients (1.6%) developed positive \nantiRoActemra antibodies; of these, six (1.4%) developed neutralizing anti-RoActemra antibodies. \nFour patients were tested positive for IgE isotype (0.9%). \n \nNo correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events was observed. \n \nHaematological abnormalities: \nNeutrophils \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 6 month controlled clinical trial SC-I, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count below 1 × 109/L occurred in 2.9% of patients on the subcutaneous weekly \ndose.  \n \nThere was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1 x 109/L and the occurrence \nof serious infections. \n \nPlatelets \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 6 month clinical trial SC-I, none of the \npatients on the SC weekly dose had a decrease in platelet count to ≤50 × 103 / μL. \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 6-month controlled clinical trial SC-I, \nelevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 6.5% and 1.4% of patients, respectively on the \nsubcutaneous weekly dose.  \n \nLipid parameters \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 6 month controlled clinical trial SC-I, 19% of \npatients experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol > 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dl), with 9% \nexperiencing a sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L(160 mg/dL) on the subcutaneous weekly \ndose.  \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nsJIA (SC) \nThe safety profile of subcutaneous RoActemra was evaluated in 51 paediatric patients (1 to 17 years of \nage) with sJIA. In general, the adverse drug reactions in patients with sJIA were similar in type to \nthose seen in RA patients (see Undesirable Effects section above).  \n \nInfections \nThe rate of infection in sJIA patients treated with SC RoActemra was comparable to sJIA patients \ntreated with IV RoActemra. \n \nInjection Site Reactions (ISRs)  \nIn the SC Study (WA28118), a total of 41.2% (21/51) sJIA patients experienced ISRs to RoActemra \nSC. The most common ISRs were erythema, pruritus, pain, and swelling at the injection site. The \nmajority of ISRs reported were Grade 1 events and all ISRs reported were non-serious and none \nrequired patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the SC Study (WA28118), 46 of the 51 (90.2%) patients tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies at \nbaseline had at least one post-baseline screening assay result. No patient developed positive anti-\ntocilizumab antibodies post baseline.  \n \nLaboratory Abnormalities \nIn the 52-week open-label SC Study (WA28118), neutrophil count decrease to below 1 × 109/L \noccurred in 23.5% of patients treated with RoActemra SC. Decreases in platelet counts to below 100 × \n103/μL occurred in 2% of the patients treated with RoActemra SC. An elevation in ALT or AST to ≥3 \nx ULN occurred in 9.8% and 4.0% patients treated with RoActemra SC, respectively.  \n \nLipid parameters \nIn the 52-week open-label SC Study (WA28118), 23.4% and 35.4% of patients experienced a post-\nbaseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to \n≥200 mg/dL at any time during study treatment, respectively. \n \npJIA (SC) \nThe safety profile of subcutaneous RoActemra was also evaluated in 52 paediatric patients with pJIA. \nThe total patient exposure to RoActemra in the pJIA all exposure population was 184.4 patient years \nfor IV and 50.4 patient years for SC tocilizumab. In general, the safety profile observed in patients \nwith pJIA was consistent with the known safety profile of RoActemra with the exception of ISRs (see \nTable 1). A higher frequency of pJIA patients experienced ISRs following SC RoActemra injections \ncompared to adult RA. \n \nInfections \nIn the SC RoActemra study, the rate of infection in pJIA patients treated with SC RoActemra was \ncomparable with pJIA patients treated with IV RoActemra. \n \nInjection Site Reactions \nA total of 28.8% (15/52) pJIA patients experienced ISRs to RoActemra SC. These ISRs occurred in a \n44% of patients ≥30 kg compared to 14.8% of patients below 30 kg.  The most common ISRs were \ninjection site erythema, swelling, hematoma, pain and pruritis. All ISRs reported were non-serious \nGrade 1 events, and none of the ISRs required patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the SC Study 5.8% [3/52] developed positive neutralizing anti-tocilizumab antibodies without \ndeveloping a serious or clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction. Of these 3 patients, 1 \nsubsequently withdrew from the study. No correlation between antibody development and clinical \nresponse or adverse events was observed \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nLaboratory Abnormalities \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra all exposure population, a decrease in \nneutrophil count below 1 × 109/L occurred in 15.4% of patients treated with SC RoActemra. An \nelevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 9.6% and 3.8% patients treated with RoActemra SC, \nrespectively. No patients treated with SC RoActemra experienced a decrease in platelet count to ≤50 × \n103 / μL.  \n \nLipid parameters \nIn the SC Study, 14.3% and 12.8% of patients experienced a post-baseline elevation of their LDL-\ncholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to ≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during study \ntreatment, respectively. \n \nGCA (SC) \nThe safety of subcutaneous RoActemra has been studied in one Phase III study (WA28119) with 251 \nGCA patients. The total patient years duration in the RoActemra all exposure population was 138.5 \npatient years during the 12 month double blind, placebo controlled phase of the study. The overall \nsafety profile observed in the RoActemra treatment groups was consistent with the known safety \nprofile of RoActemra (see Table 1). \n \nInfections \nThe rate of infection/serious infection events was balanced between the RoActemra weekly group \n(200.2/9.7 events per 100 patient years) vs. placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper (156.0/4.2 events \nper 100 patient years) and placebo plus 52 weeks taper (210.2/12.5 events per 100 patient years) \ngroups.   \n \nInjection site reactions \nIn the RoActemra subcutaneous weekly group, a total of 6% (6/100) patients reported an adverse \nreaction occurring at the site of a subcutaneous injection. No injection site reaction was reported as a \nserious adverse event or required treatment discontinuation. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the RoActemra subcutaneous weekly group, one patient (1.1%, 1/95) developed positive \nneutralizing anti-RoActemra antibodies, though not of the IgE isotype. This patient did not develop a \nhypersensitivity reaction or injection site reaction. \n \nHaematological abnormalities: \nNeutrophils \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the Roactemra 12 month controlled clinical trial, a decrease in \nneutrophil count below 1 × 109/L occurred in 4% of patients in the RoActemra subcutaneous weekly \ngroup. This was not observed in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper groups. \n \nPlatelets \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 12 month controlled clinical trial, one patient \n(1%, 1/100) in the RoActemra subcutaneous weekly group had a single transient occurence of \ndecrease in platelet count to <100 × 103 / μL without associated bleeding events. A decrease in platelet \ncount below 100 × 103 / μL was not observed in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper groups. \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 12 month controlled clinical trial, elevation in \nALT ≥3 x ULN occurred in 3% of patients in the RoActemra subcutaneous  weekly group compared \nto  2% in the placebo plus 52 week prednisone taper group and none in the placebo plus 26 week \nprednisone taper group. An elevation in AST > 3 ULN occurred in 1% of patients in the RoActemra \nsubcutaneous weekly group, compared to no patients in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper \ngroups. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nLipid parameters \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 12 month controlled clinical trial, 34% of \npatients experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol > 6.2 mmol/L  (240 mg/dL), with 15% \nexperiencing a sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) in the RoActemra \nsubcutaneous weekly group.  \n \nIntravenous use \nRA \nThe safety of RoActemra has been studied in 5 Phase III, double-blind controlled trials and their \nextension periods.  \n \nThe all control population includes all patients from the double-blind phases of each core study from \nrandomization until either the first change in the treatment regimen, or two years is reached. The \ncontrol period in 4 of the studies was 6 months and in 1 study was up to 2 years. In the double-blind \ncontrolled studies 774 patients received RoActemra 4 mg/kg in combination with MTX, 1870 patients \nreceived tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX/other DMARDs and 288 patients received \ntocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy. \n \nThe all exposure population includes all patients who received at least one dose of RoActemra either \nin the double-blind control period or open label extension phase in studies. Of the 4009 patients in this \npopulation, 3577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3296 for at least one year; 2806 received \ntreatment for at least 2 years and 1222 for 3 years. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections  \nIn the 6-month controlled studies the rate of all infections reported with RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus \nDMARD treatment was 127 events per 100 patient years compared to 112 events per 100 patient years \nin the placebo plus DMARD group. In the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of \ninfections with RoActemra was 108 events per 100 patient years exposure. \n \nIn 6-month controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections with RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus \nDMARDs was 5.3 events per 100 patient years exposure compared to 3.9 events per 100 patient years \nexposure in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the monotherapy study the rate of serious infections \nwas 3.6 events per 100 patient years of exposure in the RoActemra group and 1.5 events per \n100 patient years of exposure in the MTX group.  \n \nIn the all exposure population the overall rate of serious infections was 4.7 events per 100 pt years. \nReported serious infections, some with fatal outcome, included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, \ngastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis, bacterial arthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have also been \nreported.  \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nImpaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections. There have been post-\nmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of \nwhich had fatal outcomes. \n \nGastrointestinal perforation \nDuring the 6-month controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was \n0.26 events per 100 patient years with RoActemra therapy. In the long-term exposure population the \noverall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.28 events per 100 patient years. Reports of \ngastrointestinal perforation on RoActemra were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis \nincluding generalised purulent peritonitis, lower gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae and abscess. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nInfusion reactions  \nIn the 6-month controlled trials adverse events associated with infusion (selected events occurring \nduring or within 24 hours of infusion) were reported by 6.9% of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg \nplus DMARD group and 5.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Events reported during \nthe infusion were primarily episodes of hypertension; events reported within 24 hours of finishing an \ninfusion were headache and skin reactions (rash, urticaria). These events were not treatment limiting. \n \nThe rate of anaphylactic reactions (occurring in a total of 6/3778patients, 0.2%) was several fold \nhigher with the 4 mg/kg dose, compared to the 8 mg/kg dose. Clinically significant hypersensitivity \nreactions associated with RoActemra and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported in a total \nof  13 out of 3778 patients (0.3%) treated with RoActemra  during the controlled and open label \nclinical studies. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fifth infusions of \ntocilizumab (see section 4.4). Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported after marketing authorisation during \ntreatment with intravenous RoActemra (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunogenicity  \nA total of 2,876 patients have been tested for anti-RoActemra antibodies in the 6-month controlled \nclinical trials. Of the 46 patients (1.6%) who developed anti-RoActemra antibodies, 6 had an \nassociated medically significant hypersensitivity reaction, of which 5 led to permanent discontinuation \nof treatment. Thirty patients (1.1%) developed neutralising antibodies.  \n \nHaematological abnormalities: \nNeutrophils \nIn the 6-month controlled trials decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 109/ L occurred in 3.4% of \npatients on RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to < 0.1% of patients on placebo plus \nDMARDs. Approximately half of the patients who developed an ANC < 1 x 109/ L did so within 8 \nweeks after starting therapy. Decreases below 0.5 x 109/ L were reported in 0.3% patients receiving \nRoActemra 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs. Infections with neutropenia have been reported.  \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \ndecreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled \nclinical trials. \n \nPlatelets \nIn the 6-month controlled trials decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 103/ μL occurred in 1.7% of \npatients on RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to < 1% on placebo plus DMARDs. These \ndecreases occurred without associated bleeding events. \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \ndecreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical \ntrials. \n \nVery rare reports of pancytopenia have occurred in the post marketing setting. \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \nDuring the 6-month controlled trials transient elevations in ALT/AST > 3 x ULN were observed in \n2.1% of patients on RoActemra  8 mg/kg compared to 4.9% of patients on MTX and in 6.5% of \npatients who received 8 mg/kg RoActemra  plus DMARDs compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo \nplus DMARDs. \n \nThe addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to RoActemra monotherapy resulted in \nincreased frequency of these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST > 5 x ULN were observed in 0.7% of \nRoActemra  monotherapy patients and 1.4% of RoActemra plus DMARD patients, the majority of \nwhom were discontinued permanently from tocilizumab treatment. During the double-blind controlled \nperiod, the incidence of indirect bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal, collected as a routine \nlaboratory parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated with 8 mg/kg RoActemra  + DMARD. A total of \n\n\n\n51 \n\n5.8% of patients experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin of > 1 to 2 x ULN and 0.4% had an \nelevation of > 2 x ULN. \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \nelevation in ALT/AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical \ntrials. \n \nLipid parameters \nDuring the 6-month controlled trials, increases of lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, \ntriglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or HDL cholesterol have been reported commonly. With routine \nlaboratory monitoring it was seen that approximately 24% of patients receiving RoActemra in clinical \ntrials experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol ≥ 6.2 mmol/ L, with 15% experiencing a \nsustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/ L. Elevations in lipid parameters responded to treatment \nwith lipid-lowering agents. \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \nelevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled trials. \n \nMalignancies \nThe clinical data are insufficient to assess the potential incidence of malignancy following exposure to \nRoActemra. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing. \n \nSkin Reactions \nRare reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have occurred in the post marketing setting. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorization of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are limited data available on overdose with RoActemra. One case of accidental overdose was \nreported in which a patient with multiple myeloma received a single dose of 40 mg/kg administered \nintravenously. No adverse reactions were observed.  \n \nNo serious adverse reactions were observed in healthy volunteers who received a single dose up to \n28 mg/kg, although dose limiting neutropenia was observed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors; ATC code: L04AC07. \n \nMechanism of action \nTocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and \nmIL-6R). Tocilizumab has been shown to inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. IL-6 is a \npleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, \nmonocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 is involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell \nactivation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, induction of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis \nand stimulation of haemopoiesis. IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases including \ninflammatory diseases, osteoporosis and neoplasia.  \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n52 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn clinical studies with RoActemra, rapid decreases in CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), \nserum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen were observed. Consistent with the effect on acute phase \nreactants, treatment with RoActemra was associated with reduction in platelet count within the normal \nrange. Increases in haemoglobin levels were observed, through RoActemra decreasing the IL-6 driven \neffects on hepcidin production to increase iron availability. In RoActemra -treated patients, decreases \nin the levels of CRP to within normal ranges were seen as early as week 2, with decreases maintained \nwhile on treatment. \n \nIn GCA clinical study WA28119, similar rapid decreases in CRP and ESR were observed along with \nslight increases in mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. In healthy subjects administered \nRoActemra in doses from 2 to 28 mg/kg intravenously and 81 to 162 mg subcutaneously, absolute \nneutrophil counts decreased to their lowest 2 to 5 days following administration. Thereafter, \nneutrophils recovered towards baseline in a dose dependent manner.   \n \nPatients demonstrate a comparable (to healthy subjects) decrease of absolute neutrophil counts \nfollowing RoActemra administration (see section 4.8). \n \nSubcutaneous use \nRA \nClinical efficacy  \nThe efficacy of subcutaneous administered RoActemra in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA \nand radiographic response, was assessed in two randomised, double-blind, controlled, multi-center \nstudies. For study I (SC-I), patients were required to be >18 years of age with moderate to severe \nactive RA diagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 4 tender and 4 swollen joints at \nbaseline. All patients received background non-biologic DMARD(s). For study II (SC-II), patients \nwere required to be > 18 years of age with moderate to severe active RA diagnosed according to ACR \ncriteria who had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline. \n \nSwitching from 8 mg/kg intravenous once every 4 weeks to 162 mg subcutaneous once every week, \nwill alter exposure in the patient. The extent varies with the patient’s body weight (increased in light \nbody weight patients and decreased in heavy body weight patients) but clinical outcome is consistent \nwith that observed in intravenous treated patients. \n \nClinical response \nStudy SC-I evaluated patients with moderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate clinical \nresponse to their existing rheumatologic therapy, including one or more DMARD(s) where \napproximately 20% had a history of inadequate response to at least one TNF inhibitor. In SC-I, \n1262 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive RoActemra subcutaneous 162 mg every week or \nRoActemra intravenous 8 mg/kg every four weeks in combination with non-biologic DMARD(s). The \nprimary endpoint in the study was the difference in the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 \nresponse at week 24. The results from study SC-I is shown in Table 2. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nTable 2.

At week 24, a significant reduction in DAS28 from \nbaseline (mean improvement) of 3.5 was observed on both treatment arms, and a comparable \nproportion of patients had achieved DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) on the subcutaneous \n(38.4%) and IV (36.9%) arms. \n \nRadiographic response  \nThe radiographic response of subcutaneous administered RoActemra was assessed in a double-blind, \ncontrolled, multicenter study in patients with active RA (SC-II). Study SC-II evaluated patients with \nmoderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate clinical response to their existing rheumatologic \ntherapy, including one or more DMARD(s) where approximately 20% had a history of inadequate \nresponse to at least one TNF inhibitor. Patients were required to be >18 years of age with active RA \ndiagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline. In SC-\nII, 656 patients were randomized 2:1 to RoActemra  subcutaneous 162 mg every other week or \nplacebo, in combination with non-biologic DMARD(s). \n \nIn study SC-II, inhibition of structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as a \nchange from baseline in the van der Heijde modified mean total Sharp score (mTSS). At week 24, \ninhibition of structural damage was shown, with significantly less radiographic progression in patients \nreceiving RoActemra subcutaneous compared to placebo (mean mTSS of 0.62 vs. 1.23, p=0.0149 (van \nElteren). These results are consistent with those observed in patients treated with intravenous \nRoActemra. \nIn study SC-II, at week 24 there was ACR20 of 60.9%, ACR50 of 39.8% and ACR70 of 19.7% for \npatients treated with RoActemra subcutaneous every other week versus placebo ACR20 of 31.5%, \nACR50 of 12.3% and ACR70 of 5.0%. Patients had mean DAS28 at baseline of 6.7 on subcutaneous \nand 6.6 on placebo arms. At week 24, a significant reduction in DAS28 from baseline of 3.1 was \nobserved on subcutaneous and 1.7 on placebo arm, and for DAS28 < 2.6, 32.0% was observed on \nsubcutaneous and 4.0% on placebo arm. \n \nHealth-related and quality of life outcomes \nIn study SC-I, the mean decrease in HAQ-DI from baseline to week 24 was 0.6 on both the \nsubcutaneous and intravenous arms. The proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant \nimprovement in HAQ-DI at week 24 (change from baseline of ≥ 0.3 units) was also comparable on the \nsubcutaneous (65.2%) versus intravenous (67.4%) arms, with a weighted difference in proportions \nof - 2.3% (95% CI - 8.1, 3.4). For SF-36, the mean change from baseline at week 24 in the mental \ncomponent score was 6.22 for the subcutaneous arm and 6.54 for the intravenous arm, and for the \n\n\n\n54 \n\nphysical component score was also similar with 9.49 for the subcutaneous arm and 9.65 for the \nintravenous arm. \n \nIn study SC-II, mean decrease in HAQ-DI from baseline to week 24 was significantly greater for \npatients treated with RoActemra subcutaneous every other week (0.4) versus placebo (0.3). Proportion \nof patients achieving a clinically relevant improvement in HAQ-DI at week 24 (change from baseline \nof ≥ 0.3 units) was higher for RoActemra subcutaneous every other week (58%) versus placebo \n(46.8%). SF-36 (mean change in mental and physical component scores) was significantly greater with \nRoActemra subcutaneous group (6.5 and 5.3) versus placebo (3.8 and 2.9). \n \nsJIA (SC) \nClinical Efficacy \nA 52-week, open-label, multi-centre, PK/PD and safety study (WA28118) was conducted in paediatric \npatients with sJIA, aged 1 to 17 years, to determine the appropriate SC dose of RoActemra that \nachieved comparable PK/PD and safety profiles to the IV regimen.  \n \nEligible patients received RoActemra dosed according to body weight (BW), with patients weighing \n≥30 kg (n=26) dosed with 162 mg of RoActemra every week (QW) and patients weighing below \n30 kg (n=25) dosed with 162 mg of RoActemra every 10 days (Q10D; n=8) or every 2 weeks (Q2W; \nn=17) for 52 weeks. Of these 51 patients, 26 (51%) were naive to RoActemra and 25 (49%) had been \nreceiving RoActemra IV and switched to RoActemra SC at baseline.   \n \nExploratory efficacy results showed that RoActemra SC improved all exploratory efficacy parameters \nincluding Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-71, for TCZ naïve patients and \nmaintained all exploratory efficacy parameters for patients who switched from RoActemra IV to \nRoActemra SC treatment over the entire course of the study for patients in both body weight groups \n(below 30 kg and ≥30 kg). \n \npJIA (SC) \nA 52-week, open-label, multicenter, PK-PD and safety study was conducted in paediatric patients with \npJIA, aged 1 to 17 years old, to determine the appropriate subcutaneous dose of RoActemra that \nachieved comparable PK/PD and safety profiles to the IV regimen. \n \nEligible patients received tocilizumab dosed according to body weight (BW), with patients \nweighing  ≥30 kg (n = 25) dosed with 162 mg of RoActemra every 2 weeks (Q2W) and patients \nweighing below 30 kg (n = 27) dosed with 162 mg of RoActemra every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 52 weeks.  \nOf these 52 patients, 37 (71%) were naive to RoActemra and 15 (29%) had been receiving RoActemra \nIV and switched to RoActemra SC at baseline.   \n \nThe RoActemra SC regimens of 162 mg Q3W for patients weighing below 30 kg and of 162 mg Q2W \nfor patients weighing ≥ 30 kg respectively provide PK exposure and PD responses to support efficacy \nand safety outcomes similar to those achieved with the approved RoActemra IV regimens for pJIA. \n \nExploratory efficacy results showed that RoActemra SC improved median Juvenile Arthritis Disease \nActivity Score (JADAS)-71 for RoActemra naïve patients and maintained the median JADAS-71 for \npatients who switched from IV to SC RoActemra treatment over the entire course of the study for \npatients in both body weight groups (below 30 kg and ≥ 30 kg). \n \nGCA (SC) \nClinical efficacy \nStudy WA28119 was a randomized, multi-center, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III \nsuperiority study conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of RoActemra in patients with GCA.  \n \nTwo hundred and fifty one (251) patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA were enrolled and \nassigned to one of four treatment arms. The study consisted of a 52-week blinded period (Part 1), \nfollowed by a 104-week open-label extension (Part 2). The purpose of Part 2 was to describe the \nlong-term safety and maintenance of efficacy after 52 weeks of RoActemra therapy, to explore the rate \n\n\n\n55 \n\nof relapse and the requirement for RoActemra therapy beyond 52 weeks, and to gain insight into the \npotential long-term steroid-sparing effect of RoActemra. \n \nTwo subcutaneous doses of RoActemra (162 mg every week and 162 mg every other week) were \ncompared to two different placebo control groups randomised 2:1:1:1. \n \nAll patients received background glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy. Each of the RoActemra-treated \ngroups and one of the placebo-treated groups followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over \n26 weeks, while the second placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen \nover 52 weeks, designed to be more in keeping with standard practice.  \n \nThe duration of glucocorticoid therapy during screening and before RoActemra (or placebo) was \ninitiated, was similar in all 4 treatment groups (see Table 3). \n \nTable 3.

RoActemra subcutaneous weekly dose also showed a clinically meaningful decrease in the risk \nfor flare compared to placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone in patients who entered the trial with relapsing \nGCA as well as those with new-onset disease (Table 4).  \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nCumulative glucocorticoid dose  \nThe cumulative prednisone dose at week 52 was significantly lower in the two RoActemra dose \ngroups compared to the two placebo groups (Table 4). In a separate analysis of the patients who \nreceived escape prednisone to treat GCA flare during the first 52 weeks, the cumulative prednisone \ndose varied greatly.  The median doses for escape patients in the RoActemra weekly and every other \nweekly groups were 3129.75 mg and 3847 mg, respectively. Both considerably lower than in the \nplacebo plus 26 weeks and the placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper groups, 4023.5 mg and \n5389.5 mg respectively. \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nTable 4.

The PCS mean change from baseline to week 52 was \nhigher (showing more improvement) in the RoActemra weekly and every other weekly dose groups \n[4.10, 2.76, respectively] than in the two placebo groups [placebo plus 26 weeks; -0.28, placebo plus \n52 weeks; -1.49], although only the comparison between RoActemra weekly plus 26 weeks \nprednisone taper group and placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper group (5.59, 99% CI: 8.6, 10.32) \nshowed a statistically significant difference (p=0.0024).  For MCS, the mean change from baseline to \nweek 52 for both RoActemra weekly and every other weekly dose groups [7.28, 6.12, respectively] \nwere higher than the placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper group [2.84] (although the differences \nwere not statistically significant [weekly p=0.0252 for weekly, p=0.1468 for every other weekly]) and \nsimilar to the placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group [6.67].  \n \nThe Patient’s Global Assessment of disease activity was assessed on a 0-100mm Visual Analogue \nScale (VAS). The mean change in Patient’s global VAS from baseline at week 52 was lower (showing \ngreater improvement) in the RoActemra weekly and every other weekly dose groups [-19.0, -25.3, \nrespectively] than in both placebo groups [placebo plus 26 weeks -3.4, placebo plus 52 weeks -7.2], \nalthough only the RoActemra every other weekly plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group showed a \nstatistically significant difference compared to placebo [placebo plus 26 weeks taper p=0.0059, and \nplacebo plus 52 weeks taper p=0.0081]. \n \nFACIT-Fatigue change from baseline to week 52 scores were calculated for all groups.  The mean \n[SD] change scores were as follows: RoActemra weekly plus 26 weeks 5.61 [10.115], RoActemra \nevery other weekly plus 26 weeks 1.81 [8.836], placebo plus 26 weeks 0.26 [10.702], and placebo plus \n52 weeks -1.63 [6.753].  \n \nChange in EQ5D scores from baseline to week 52 were RoActemra weekly plus 26 weeks 0.10 \n[0.198], RoActemra every other weekly plus 26 weeks 0.05 [0.215], placebo plus 26 weeks 0.07 \n[0.293], and placebo plus 52 weeks -0.02 [0.159]. \n \nHigher scores signal improvement in both FACIT-Fatigue and EQ5D. \n \nIntravenous use \nRA \nClinical efficacy  \nThe efficacy of RoActemra in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA was assessed in five \nrandomised, double-blind, multi-centre studies. Studies I-V enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with \nactive RA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and who had \nat least eight tender and six swollen joints at baseline.  \n \nIn Study I, RoActemra was administered intravenously every four weeks as monotherapy. In Studies \nII, III and V, RoActemra was administered intravenously every four weeks in combination with MTX \nvs. placebo and MTX. In Study IV, RoActemra was administered intravenously every 4 weeks in \ncombination with other DMARDs vs. placebo and other DMARDs. The primary endpoint for each of \nthe five studies was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.  \n \nStudy I evaluated 673 patients who had not been treated with MTX within six months prior to \nrandomisation and who had not discontinued previous MTX treatment as a result of clinically \nimportant toxic effects or lack of response. The majority (67%) of patients were MTX-naïve. Doses of \n8 mg/kg of RoActemra were given every four weeks as monotherapy. The comparator group was \nweekly MTX (dose titrated from 7.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg weekly over an eight week period).  \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nStudy II, a two year study with planned analyses at week 24, week 52 and week 104, evaluated \n1196 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg of \nRoActemraor placebo were given every four weeks as blinded therapy for 52 weeks in combination \nwith stable MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly). After week 52, all patients could receive open-label \ntreatment with RoActemra 8 mg/kg. Of the patients who completed the study who were originally \nrandomised to placebo + MTX, 86% received open-label RoActemra 8 mg/kg in year 2. The primary \nendpoint at week 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At week 52 \nand week 104 the co-primary endpoints were prevention of joint damage and improvement in physical \nfunction. \n \nStudy III evaluated 623 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or \n8 mg/kg RoActemra or placebo were given every four weeks, in combination with stable MTX (10 mg \nto 25 mg weekly).  \n \nStudy IV evaluated 1,220 patients who had an inadequate response to their existing rheumatologic \ntherapy, including one or more DMARDs. Doses of 8 mg/kg RoActemra or placebo were given every \nfour weeks in combination with stable DMARDs.  \n \nStudy V evaluated 499 patients who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or \nmore TNF antagonist therapies. The TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued prior to randomisation. \nDoses of 4 or 8 mg/kg RoActemra or placebo were given every four weeks in combination with stable \nMTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly).  \n \nClinical response \nIn all studies, patients treated with RoActemra 8 mg/kg had statistically significant higher ACR 20, 50, \n70 response rates at 6 months compared to control (Table 5). In study I, superiority of RoActemra \n8 mg/kg was demonstrated against the active comparator MTX. \nThe treatment effect was similar in patients independent of rheumatoid factor status, age, gender, race, \nnumber of prior treatments or disease status. Time to onset was rapid (as early as week 2) and the \nmagnitude of response continued to improve with duration of treatment. Continued durable responses \nwere seen for over 3 years in the open label extension studies I-V.  \n \nIn patients treated with RoActemra 8 mg/kg, significant improvements were noted on all individual \ncomponents of the ACR response including: tender and swollen joint counts; patients and physician \nglobal assessment; disability index scores; pain assessment and CRP compared to patients receiving \nplacebo plus MTX or other DMARDs in all studies.  \n \nPatients in studies I – V had a mean Disease Activity Score (DAS28) of 6.5–6.8 at baseline. \nSignificant reduction in DAS28 from baseline (mean improvement) of 3.1–3.4 was observed in \nRoActemra-treated patients compared to control patients (1.3-2.1). The proportion of patients \nachieving a DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) was significantly higher in patients receiving \nRoActemra (28–34%) compared to 1–12% of control patients at 24 weeks. In study II, 65% of patients \nachieved a DAS28 < 2.6 at week 104 compared to 48% at 52 weeks and 33% of patients at week 24. \n \nIn a pooled analysis of studies II, III and IV, the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50 and \n70 response was significantly higher (59% vs. 50%, 37% vs. 27%, 18% vs. 11%, respectively) in the \ntocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD vs. the tocilizumab 4 mg/kg plus DMARD group (p< 0.03). \nSimilarly the proportion of patients achieving a DAS 28 remission (DAS28 < 2.6) was significantly \nhigher (31% vs. 16% respectively) in patients receiving RoActemra  8 mg/kg plus DMARD than in \npatients receiving RoActemra  4 mg/kg plus DMARD (p< 0.0001). \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\nTable 5.

Ninety three percent (93%; n=271) of patients had no \nprogression between week 52 and week 104. \n \nHealth-related and quality of life outcomes \nRoActemra -treated patients reported an improvement in all patient-reported outcomes (Health \nAssessment Questionnaire Disability Index - HAQ-DI), Short Form-36 and Functional Assessment of \nChronic Illness Therapy questionnaires. Statistically significant improvements in HAQ-DI scores were \nobserved in patients treated with RoActemra compared with patients treated with DMARDs. During \nthe open-label period of Study II, the improvement in physical function has been maintained for up to \n2 years. At Week 52, the mean change in HAQ-DI was -0.58 in the RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus MTX \ngroup compared with -0.39 in the placebo + MTX group. The mean change in HAQ-DI was \nmaintained at Week 104 in the RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus MTX group (-0.61). \n \nHaemoglobin levels  \nStatistically significant improvements in haemoglobin levels were observed with RoActemra \ncompared with DMARDs (p< 0.0001) at week 24. Mean haemoglobin levels increased by week 2 and \nremained within normal range through to week 24.  \n \nRoActemra versus adalimumab in monotherapy \nStudy VI (WA19924), a 24 week double-blinded study that compared RoActemra  monotherapy with \nadalimumab monotherapy, evaluated 326 patients with RA who were intolerant of MTX or where \ncontinued treatment with MTX was considered inappropriate (including MTX inadequate responders). \nPatients in the RoActemra  arm received an intravenous (IV) infusion of RoActemra (8 mg/kg) every \n4 weeks (q4w) and a subcutaneous (SC) placebo injection every 2 weeks (q2w). Patients in the \nadalimumab arm received an adalimumab SC injection (40 mg) q2w plus an IV placebo infusion q4w. \n \nA statistically significant superior treatment effect was seen in favour of RoActemra over adalimumab \nin control of disease activity from baseline to week 24 for the primary endpoint of change in DAS28 \nand for all secondary endpoints (Table 7). \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\nTable 7: Efficacy Results for Study VI (WA19924) \n \n\n \n\nADA + Placebo \n(IV) \n\nN = 162 \n\nTCZ + Placebo \n(SC) \n\nN = 163 p-value(a) \nPrimary Endpoint - Mean Change from baseline at Week 24 \n\nDAS28 (adjusted mean)  -1.8 -3.3   \nDifference in adjusted mean (95% \n\nCI) \n-1.5 (-1.8, -1.1) <0.0001 \n\nSecondary Endpoints - Percentage of Responders at Week 24 (b) \nDAS28 < 2.6, n (%) 17 (10.5) 65 (39.9) <0.0001 \nDAS28 ≤ 3.2, n (%)  32 (19.8)  84 (51.5) <0.0001 \n\nACR20 response, n (%) 80 (49.4) 106 (65.0) 0.0038 \nACR50 response, n (%) 45 (27.8) 77 (47.2) 0.0002 \nACR70 response, n (%) 29 (17.9) 53 (32.5) 0.0023 \n\nap value is adjusted for region and duration of RA for all endpoints and additionally baseline value for all continuous \nendpoints. \nb Non-responder Imputation used for missing data. Multiplicity controlled using Bonferroni-Holm Procedure \n \nThe overall clinical adverse event profile was similar between RoActemra and adalimumab. The \nproportion of patients with serious adverse events was balanced between the treatment groups \n(RoActemra  11.7% vs. adalimumab 9.9%). The types of adverse drug reactions in the RoActemra arm \nwere consistent with the known safety profile of RoActemra and adverse drug reactions were reported \nat a similar frequency compared with Table 1. A higher incidence of infections and infestations was \nreported in the RoActemra arm (48% vs. 42%), with no difference in the incidence of serious \ninfections (3.1%). Both study treatments induced the same pattern of changes in laboratory safety \nparameters (decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts, increases in ALT, AST and lipids), however, \nthe magnitude of change and the frequency of marked abnormalities was higher with RoActemra  \ncompared with adalimumab. Four (2.5%) patients in the RoActemra arm and two (1.2%) patients in \nthe adalimumab arm experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decreases. Eleven (6.8%) patients \nin the RoActemra arm and five (3.1%) patients in the adalimumab arm experienced ALT increases of \nCTC grade 2 or higher. The mean LDL increase from baseline was 0.64 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) for \npatients in the RoActemra  arm and 0.19 mmol/L (7 mg/dL) for patients in the adalimumab arm. The \nsafety observed in the tocilizumab arm was consistent with the known safety profile of RoActemra and \nno new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra is characterized by nonlinear elimination which is a combination \nof linear clearance and Michaelis-Menten elimination.  The nonlinear part of RoActemra elimination \nleads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional.  The pharmacokinetic parameters \nof RoActemra do not change with time. Due to the dependence of total clearance on RoActemra serum \nconcentrations, the half-life of RoActemra is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on \nthe serum concentration level. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so \nfar indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies.  \n \nRA \nIntravenous use \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on \na database composed of 3552 RA patients treated with a one-hour infusion of 4 or 8 mg/kg RoActemra  \nevery 4 weeks for 24 weeks or with 162 mg tocilizumab given subcutaneously either once a week or \nevery other week  for 24 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nThe following parameters (predicted mean ± SD) were estimated for a dose of 8 mg/kg RoActemra \ngiven every 4 weeks: steady-state area under curve (AUC) = 38000 ± 13000 h•µg/mL, trough \nconcentration (Cmin) = 15.9 ± 13.1 µg/mL and maximum concentration (Cmax) = 182 ± 50.4 µg/mL, \nand. the accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax were small, 1.32 and 1.09, respectively. The \naccumulation ratio was higher for Cmin (2.49), which was expected based on the non-linear clearance \ncontribution at lower concentrations. Steady-state was reached following the first administration for \nCmax and after 8 and 20 weeks for AUC and Cmin, respectively. RoActemra AUC, Cmin and Cmax \nincreased with increase of body weight. At body weight ≥ 100 kg, the predicted mean (± SD) steady-\nstate AUC, Cmin and Cmax of RoActemra were 50000 ± 16800 μg•h/mL, 24.4 ± 17.5 μg/mL, and 226 \n± 50.3 μg/mL, respectively, which are higher than mean exposure values for the patient population \n(i.e. all body weights) reported above. The dose-response curve for tocilizumab flattens at higher \nexposure, resulting in smaller efficacy gains for each incremental increase in RoActemra concentration \nsuch that clinically meaningful increases in efficacy were not demonstrated in patients treated with > \n800 mg of RoActemra. Therefore, RoActemra doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not \nrecommended (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nIn RA patients the central volume of distribution was 3.72 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was \n3.35 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.07 L.  \n \nElimination \nFollowing intravenous administration, RoActemra undergoes biphasic elimination from the \ncirculation. The total clearance of RoActemra was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the \nlinear and non-linear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population \npharmacokinetic analysis and was 9.5 mL/h. The concentration-dependent non-linear clearance plays a \nmajor role at low RoActemra concentrations. Once the non-linear clearance pathway is saturated, at \nhigher RoActemra concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance.  \n \nThe t1/2 of RoActemra was concentration-dependent. At steady-state following a dose of 8 mg/kg \nevery 4 weeks, the effective t1/2 decreased with decreasing concentrations within a dosing interval \nfrom 18 days to 6 days.  \n \nLinearity \nPharmacokinetic parameters of RoActemra did not change with time. A more than dose-proportional \nincrease in the AUC and Cmin was observed for doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Cmax increased \ndose-proportionally. At steady-state, predicted AUC and Cmin were 3.2 and 30 fold higher at 8 mg/kg \nas compared to 4 mg/kg, respectively. \n \nSubcutaneous use \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on \na database composed of 3552 RA patients treated with 162 mg subcutaneous every week, 162 mg \nsubcutaneous every other week, and or 4 or 8 mg/kg intravenous every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of RoActemra did not change with time. For the 162 mg every week \ndose, the predicted mean (±SD) steady-state AUC1week, Cmin and Cmax of RoActemra were \n7970 ± 3432 µg•h/mL, 43.0 ± 19.8 µg/mL, and 49.8 ± 21.0 µg/mL, respectively. The accumulation \nratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.32, 6.30, and 5.27, respectively. Steady state was reached after \n12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax. \n \nFor the 162 every other week dose, the predicted mean (±SD) steady-state AUC2week, Cmin, and Cmax of \nRoActemra were 3430 ± 2660 µg•h/mL, 5.7 ± 6.8 µg/mL, and 13.2 ± 8.8 µg/mL, respectively. The \naccumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 6.02, and 2.12, respectively. Steady state was \nreached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax. \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing subcutaneous dosing in RA patients, the time to peak serum RoActemra concentrations tmax \nwas 2.8 days. The bioavailability for the subcutaneous formulation was 79%. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \nElimination \nFor subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 is up to 13 days for 162 mg every week and 5 days \nfor 162 mg every other week in patients with RA at steady-state.  \n \nsJIA \nSubcutaneous Use \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra in sJIA patients was characterized by a population \npharmacokinetic analysis which included 140 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 2 \nweeks (patients weighing ≥30 kg), 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), \n162 mg SC every week (patients weighing ≥30 kg), 162 mg SC every 10 days or every 2 weeks \n(patients weighing below 30 kg).  \n \nLimited data are available regarding exposures following subcutaneous administration of RoActemra \nin sJIA patients below 2 years of age with a body weight less than 10 kg.  \nPatients with sJIA must have a minimum body weight of 10 kg when receiving RoActemra \nsubcutaneously (see section 4.2). \n \nTable 8.

The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population \npharmacokinetic analysis and was 5.7 mL/h in paediatric patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic \narthritis. Following subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 of RoActemra in sJIA patients is up \nto 14 days for both the 162 mg QW and Q2W regimens during a dosing interval at steady state.  \n \npJIA  \nSubcutaneous use \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra in pJIA patients was characterized by a population \npharmacokinetic analysis which included 237 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 4 \nweeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), \n162 mg SC every 2 weeks (patients weighing   ≥ 30 kg), or 162 mg SC every 3 weeks (patients \nweighing   below 30 kg). \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \nTable 9.

After SC dosing, approximately \n90% of the steady-state was reached by Week 12 for both the 162 mg SC Q2W and Q3W regimens. \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing SC dosing in pJIA patients, the absorption half-life was around 2 days, and the \nbioavailability for the SC formulation in pJIA patients was 96%. \n \nDistribution \nIn paediatric patients with pJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.97 L, the peripheral volume \nof distribution was 2.03 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.0 L. \n \nElimination \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis for pJIA patients showed body size related impact on linear \nclearance so that body-weight based dosing should be taken into consideration (see Table 9).  \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 of RoActemra in pJIA patients is up to 10 days for \npatients < 30 kg (162 mg SC Q3W) and up to 7 days for patients >= 30 kg (162 mg SC Q2W)  during \na dosing interval at steady state. Following intravenous administration, tocilizumab undergoes \nbiphasic elimination from the circulation. The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentration-\ndependent and is the sum of the linear and non-linear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as \na parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and was 6.25 mL/h. The concentration-\ndependent non-linear clearance plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the non-\nlinear clearance pathway is saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly \ndetermined by the linear clearance. \n \nGCA \nSubcutaneous use \nThe PK of RoActemra in GCA patients were determined using a population PK model from an \nanalysis dataset composed of 149 GCA patients treated with 162 mg subcutaneous every week or \n162 mg subcutaneous every other week.  The developed model had the same structure as the \npopulation PK model developed earlier based on data from RA patients (see Table 10). \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nTable 10.

Approximately 90% of the steady-state (AUCτ) was reached by \nweek 14 in the every other weekly and week 17 in the weekly dose groups. \n \nBased on the current characterization of PK, RoActemra trough concentration at steady state are 50% \nhigher in this population relative to average concentrations in a large dataset from the RA population. \nThese differences occur due to unknown reasons. PK differences are not accompanied by marked \ndifferences in PD parameters and so the clinical relevance is unknown.   \n \nIn GCA patients, higher exposure was observed in patients with lower body weight. For the 162 mg \nevery week dosing regimen, the steady-state Cavg was 51% higher in patients with body weight less \nthan 60 kg compared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. For the 162 mg every other week \nregimen, the steady-state Cavg was 129% higher in patients with body weight less than 60 kg \ncompared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. There is limited data for patients above 100 kg \n(n=7). \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing subcutaneous dosing in GCA patients, the absorption t½ was around 4 days.  The \nbioavailability for the SC formulation was 0.8. The median values of Tmax were 3 days after the \nRoActemra  weekly dose and 4.5 days after the tocilizumab every other week dose.   \n \nDistribution \nIn GCA patients, the central volume of distribution was 4.09 L, the peripheral volume of distribution \nwas 3.37 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.46 L. \n \nElimination \nThe total clearance of RoActemra  was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance \nand the nonlinear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population \npharmacokinetic analysis and was 6.7 mL/h in GCA patients, \n \nIn GCA patients, at steady state, the effective t ½ of RoActemra varied between 18.3 and 18.9 days for \n162 mg weekly regimen, and between 4.2 and 7.9 days for 162 mg every other weekly regimen. At \nhigh serum concentrations, when total clearance of RoActemra is dominated by linear clearance, an \neffective  t ½ of approximately 32 days was derived from the population parameter estimates. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment: No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nRoActemra  has been conducted. Most of the patients in the RA and GCA studies population \npharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Mild renal impairment \n\n\n\n67 \n\n(estimated creatinine clearance based on Cockcroft-Gault formula ) did not impact the \npharmacokinetics of RoActemra. \n \nApproximately one-third of the patients in the GCA study had moderate renal impairment at baseline \n(estimated creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min). No impact on RoActemra exposure was noted in \nthese patients. \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment: No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nRoActemra  has been conducted.  \n \nAge, gender and ethnicity: Population pharmacokinetic analyses in RA and GCA patients, showed that \nage, gender and ethnic origin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of RoActemra.  \n \nResults of the population PK analysis for sJIA and pJIA patients confirmed that body size is the only \ncovariate which has an appreciable impact on the pharmacokinetics of RoActemra including \nelimination and absorption so that body-weight based dosing should be taken into consideration (see \nTables 8 and 9). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies were not performed because IgG1 monoclonal antibodies are not deemed to \nhave intrinsic carcinogenic potential.  \n \nAvailable non-clinical data demonstrated the effect of IL-6 on malignant progression and apoptosis \nresistance to various cancer types. This data does not suggest a relevant risk for cancer initiation and \nprogression under RoActemra treatment. Additionally, proliferative lesions were not observed in a \n6-month chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys or in IL-6 deficient mice.  \n \nAvailable non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under RoActemra treatment. Effects on \nendocrine active and reproductive system organs were not observed in a chronic cynomolgus monkey \ntoxicity study and reproductive performance was not affected in IL-6 deficient mice. RoActemra \nadministered to cynomolgus monkeys during early gestation, was observed to have no direct or \nindirect harmful effect on pregnancy or embryonal-foetal development. However, a slight increase in \nabortion/embryonal-foetal death was observed with high systemic exposure (> 100 x human exposure) \nin the 50 mg/kg/day high-dose group compared to placebo and other low-dose groups. Although IL-6 \ndoes not seem to be a critical cytokine for foetal growth or the immunological control of the \nmaternal/foetal interface, a relation of this finding to RoActemra  cannot be excluded. \n \nTreatment with a murine analogue did not exert toxicity in juvenile mice. In particular, there was no \nimpairment of skeletal growth, immune function and sexual maturation. \n \nThe non-clinical safety profile of RoActemra  in the cynomolgus monkey does not suggest  \na difference between intravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration. \n \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRoActemra 162 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 162 mg of RoActemra (tocilizumab) in 0.9 mL. \n \nRoActemra is a recombinant humanized, anti-human monoclonal antibody of the \nimmunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) sub-class directed against soluble and membrane-bound interleukin 6 \nreceptors. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled pen (ACTPen).  \n \nA colourless to slightly yellowish solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRoActemra, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for \n \n\n• the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults not \npreviously treated with MTX. \n\n• the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have either responded \ninadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-\nmodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.  \n\n \nIn these patients, RoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where \ncontinued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.  \n \nRoActemra has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray \nand to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \nRoActemra is indicated for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in \npatients 12 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs \nand systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.2). \nRoActemra can be given as monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX or where treatment with \nMTX is inappropriate) or in combination with MTX.  \n \nRoActemra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile \nidiopathic polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in \npatients 12 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX \n(see Section 4.2). \nRoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment \nwith MTX is inappropriate. \n \nRoActemra is indicated for the treatment of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) in adult patients. \n \n\n\n\n71 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTocilizumab SC formulation is administered with a single-use pre-filled pen. Treatment should be \ninitiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA \nand/or GCA.  \n \nThe pre-filled pen should not be used to treat paediatric patients < 12 years of age since there is a \npotential risk of intramuscular injection due to thinner subcutaneous tissue layer. \nThe first injection should be performed under the supervision of a qualified health care professional. A \npatient or parent/guardian can inject RoActemra only if the physician determines that it is appropriate \nand the patient or parent/guardian agrees to medical follow-up as necessary and has been trained in \nproper injection technique.  \n \nPatients who transition from tocilizumab IV therapy to SC administration should administer the first \nSC dose at the time of the next scheduled IV dose under the supervision of a qualified health care \nprofessional. \n \nAll patients treated with RoActemra should be given the Patient Alert Card.  \n \nSuitability of the patient or parent/guardian for subcutaneous home use should be assessed and patients \nor their parent/guardian should be instructed to inform a healthcare professional before administering \nthe next dose if they experience symptoms of an allergic reaction. Patients should seek immediate \nmedical attention if developing symptoms of serious allergic reactions (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nRA \nThe recommended posology is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week. \n \nLimited information is available regarding switching patients from RoActemra intravenous \nformulation to RoActemra subcutaneous fixed dose formulation. The once every week dosing interval \nshould be followed. \n \nPatients transitioning from intravenous to subcutaneous formulation should administer their first \nsubcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose under the supervision of a qualified \nhealthcare professional. \n \nGCA \nThe recommended posology is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week in combination with a tapering \ncourse of glucocorticoids. RoActemra can be used alone following discontinuation of glucocorticoids. \nRoActemra monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of acute relapses (see 4.4). \n \nBased upon the chronic nature of GCA, treatment beyond 52 weeks should be guided by disease \nactivity, physician discretion, and patient choice. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nRA and GCA \nDose adjustments due to laboratory abnormalities (see section 4.4).  \n \n• Liver enzyme abnormalities \n \nLaboratory Value Action \n\n> 1 to 3 x Upper \nLimit of Normal \n(ULN) \n\nDose modify concomitant DMARDs (RA) or immunomodulatory agents (GCA) \nif appropriate. \n\nFor persistent increases in this range, reduce RoActemra dose frequency to \nevery other week injection or interrupt RoActemra until alanine \naminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have normalised. \n \nRestart with weekly or every other week injection, as clinically appropriate. \n\n> 3 to 5 x ULN Interrupt RoActemra dosing until < 3 x ULN and follow recommendations \nabove for > 1 to 3 x ULN. \n\nFor persistent increases > 3 x ULN (confirmed by repeat testing, see 4.4.), \ndiscontinue RoActemra. \n\n> 5 x ULN Discontinue RoActemra. \n\n \n• Low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \n \nIn patients not previously treated with RoActemra, initiation is not recommended in patients with an \nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2 x 109/L. \n \nLaboratory Value \n(cells x 109/ L ) \n\nAction \n\nANC > 1  Maintain dose. \n\nANC 0.5 to 1 Interrupt RoActemra dosing. \n\nWhen ANC increases > 1 x 109/ L resume RoActemra dosing every other week \nand increase to every week injection, as clinically appropriate. \n\nANC < 0.5 Discontinue RoActemra. \n\n \n• Low platelet count \n \nLaboratory Value \n(cells x 103/ μL) \n\nAction \n\n50 to 100 Interrupt RoActemra dosing. \n\nWhen platelet count > 100 x 103/ μL resume RoActemra dosing every other \nweek and increase to every week injection as clinically appropriate. \n\n< 50 Discontinue RoActemra. \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n\nRA and GCA  \nMissed dose \nIf a patient misses a subcutaneous weekly injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled dose, \nhe/she should be instructed to take the missed dose on the next scheduled day. If a patient misses a \nsubcutaneous once every other week injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled dose, \nhe/she should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and the next dose on the next \nscheduled day.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly: \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients >65 years of age.  \n \nRenal impairment:  \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. RoActemra has \nnot been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). Renal function should be \nmonitored closely in these patients.  \n \nHepatic impairment:  \nRoActemra has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose \nrecommendations can be made.  \n \nPaediatric patients  \nThe safety and efficacy of RoActemra subcutaneous formulation in children from birth to less than 1 \nyear have not been established. No data are available. \n \nA change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient’s body weight over time.  \nRoActemra can be used alone or in combination with MTX. \n \nsJIA Patients \nThe recommended posology in patients above 12 years of age is 162 mg subcutaneously once every \nweek in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 162 mg subcutaneously once every 2 \nweeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg.  \n \nThe pre-filled pen should not be used to treat paediatric patients < 12 years of age. \n \nPatients must have a minimum body weight of 10 kg when receiving RoActemra subcutaneously. \n \npJIA Patients: \nThe recommended posology in patients above 12 years of age is 162 mg subcutaneously once every 2 \nweeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 162 mg subcutaneously once every 3 \nweeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg. \n \nThe pre-filled pen should not be used to treat paediatric patients < 12 years of age. \n \nDose adjustments due to laboratory abnormalities (sJIA and pJIA)  \n \nIf appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other medications should be modified or dosing \nstopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the clinical situation has been evaluated. As there are \nmany co-morbid conditions that may effect laboratory values in sJIA or pJIA, the decision to \ndiscontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical assessment of \nthe individual patient. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\n• Liver enzyme abnormalities \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n\nAction \n\n> 1 to 3 x ULN Modify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n \nFor persistent increases in this range, interrupt RoActemra until \nALT/AST have normalized.  \n\n> 3 x ULN to 5x \nULN \n \n\nModify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n \nInterrupt RoActemra dosing until < 3x ULN and follow \nrecommendations above for >1 to 3x ULN \n \n\n> 5x ULN Discontinue RoActemra.  \n \nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in sJIA or pJIA for a \nlaboratory abnormality should be based on the medical \nassessment of the individual patient. \n\n \n• Low absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n(cells x \n109/ L ) \n \n\nAction \n\nANC > 1  Maintain dose \n \n\nANC 0.5 to \n1 \n\nInterrupt RoActemra dosing \n \nWhen ANC increases to > 1 x 109/ L resume RoActemra  \n \n\nANC < 0.5 Discontinue RoActemra \n \nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in sJIA or pJIA for a laboratory \nabnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the individual \npatient. \n \n\n \n• Low platelet count  \n \n\nLaboratory \nValue \n(cells x 103/µL) \n\nAction \n\n50 to 100 Modify the dose of the concomitant MTX if appropriate \n \nInterrupt RoActemra dosing \n \nWhen platelet count is > 100 x 103/µl resume RoActemra  \n \n\n< 50  Discontinue RoActemra.  \n \nThe decision to discontinue RoActemra in sJIA or pJIA for a \nlaboratory abnormality should be based on the medical \nassessment of the individual patient. \n \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \nReduction of tocilizumab dosing frequency due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in \nsJIA or pJIA patients. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of RoActemra subcutaneous formulation in children with conditions other than \nsJIA or pJIA have not been established.  \n \nAvailable data with the IV formulation suggest that clinical improvement is observed within 12 weeks \nof initiation of treatment with RoActemra. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a \npatient exhibiting no improvement within this timeframe. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a sJIA patient misses a subcutaneous weekly injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled \ndose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose on the next scheduled day. If a patient misses \na subcutaneous once every 2 week injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she \nshould be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and the next dose on the next scheduled day.  \n \nIf a pJIA patient misses a subcutaneous injection of RoActemra within 7 days of the scheduled dose, \nhe/she should take the missed dose as soon as they remember and take the next dose at the regular \nscheduled time. If a patient misses a subcutaneous injection of RoActemra by more than 7 days of the \nscheduled dose or is unsure when to inject RoActemra, call the doctor or pharmacist. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRoActemra is for subcutaneous use.  \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with RoActemra if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate. The total content (0.9 mL) of the pre-filled pen should be \nadministered as a subcutaneous injection. The recommended injection sites (abdomen, thigh and upper \narm) should be rotated and injections should never be given into moles, scars, or areas where the skin \nis tender, bruised, red, hard, or not intact. \n \nThe pre-filled pen should not be shaken.  \n \nComprehensive instructions for the administration of RoActemra in a pre-filled pen are given in the \npackage leaflet, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRoActemra subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections  \nSerious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive \nagents including RoActemra (see section 4.8, Undesirable effects). RoActemra treatment must not be \ninitiated in patients with active infections (see section 4.3). Administration of RoActemra should be \ninterrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled (see section 4.8). \nHealthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use of RoActemra in patients \n\n\n\n76 \n\nwith a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, \ndiabetes and interstitial lung disease which may predispose patients to infections. \n \nVigilance for the timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving \nimmunosuppressive agents such as RoActemra as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be \nlessened, due to suppression of the acute phase reactants. The effects of RoActemra on C-reactive \nprotein (CRP), neutrophils and signs and symptoms of infection should be considered when evaluating \na patient for a potential infection. Patients, and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients, should be \ninstructed to contact their healthcare professional immediately when any symptoms suggesting \ninfection appear, in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment. \n \nTuberculosis \nAs recommended for other biological treatments, all patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis \n(TB) infection prior to starting RoActemra therapy. Patients with latent TB should be treated with \nstandard anti-mycobacterial therapy before initiating RoActemra. Prescribers are reminded of the risk \nof false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood test results, especially in patients \nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nPatients, and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients should be advised to seek medical advice if \nsigns/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade (fever) suggestive of a \ntuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with RoActemra.  \n \nViral reactivation \nViral reactivation (e.g. hepatitis B virus) has been reported with biologic therapies for RA. In clinical \nstudies with RoActemra, patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded. \n \nComplications of diverticulitis \nEvents of diverticular perforations as complications of diverticulitis have been reported uncommonly \nin patients treated with RoActemra (see section 4.8). RoActemra should be used with caution in \npatients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or diverticulitis. Patients presenting with \nsymptoms potentially indicative of complicated diverticulitis, such as abdominal pain, haemorrhage \nand/or unexplained change in bowel habits with fever should be evaluated promptly for early \nidentification of diverticulitis which can be associated with gastrointestinal perforation. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported in association with \nRoActemra (see section 4.8). Such reactions may be more severe, and potentially fatal in patients who \nhave experienced hypersensitivity reactions during previous treatment with RoActemra even if they \nhave received premedication with steroids and antihistamines. If an anaphylactic reaction or other \nserious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of RoActemra should be stopped immediately, \nappropriate therapy initiated and RoActemra should be permanently discontinued. \n \nActive hepatic disease and hepatic impairment \nTreatment with RoActemra, particularly when administered concomitantly with MTX, may be \nassociated with elevations in hepatic transaminases, therefore, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \nHepatotoxicity \nTransient or intermittent mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been reported \ncommonly with RoActemra treatment (see section 4.8). An increased frequency of these elevations \nwas observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) were used in combination with \nRoActemra. When clinically indicated, other liver function tests including bilirubin should be \nconsidered. \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nSerious drug-induced liver injury, including acute liver failure, hepatitis and jaundice, have been \nobserved with RoActemra (see section 4.8). Serious hepatic injury occurred between 2 weeks to more \nthan 5 years after initiation of RoActemra. Cases of liver failure resulting in liver transplantation have \nbeen reported. Patients should be advised to immediately seek medical help if they experience signs \nand symptoms of hepatic injury.  \n \nCaution should be exercised when considering initiation of RoActemra treatment in patients with \nelevated ALT or AST > 1.5 x ULN. In patients with baseline ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, treatment is not \nrecommended. \n \nIn RA, GCA, pJIA and sJIA patients, ALT/AST should be monitored every 4 to 8 weeks for the first 6 \nmonths of treatment followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. For recommended modifications, \nincluding RoActemra discontinuation, based on transaminases levels see section 4.2. For ALT or AST \nelevations > 3–5 x ULN, RoActemra treatment should be interrupted.  \n \nHaematological abnormalities \nDecreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with RoActemra \n8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in \npatients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist. \n \nIn patients not previously treated with RoActemra, initiation is not recommended in patients with an \nANC below 2 x 109/L. Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of RoActemra \ntreatment in patients with a low platelet count (i.e. platelet count below 100 x 103/ μL). In patients who \ndevelop an ANC < 0.5 x 109/L or a platelet count < 50 x 103/μL, continued treatment is not \nrecommended. \n \nSevere neutropenia may be associated with an increased risk of serious infections, although there has \nbeen no clear association between decreases in neutrophils and the occurrence of serious infections in \nclinical trials with RoActemra to date.  \n \nIn RA and GCA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of \ntherapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications \nbased on ANC and platelet counts, see section 4.2. \n \nIn sJIA and pJIA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored at the time of the second \nadministration and thereafter according to good clinical practice (see section 4.2). \n \nLipid parameters \nElevations in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides were observed in patients treated with RoActemra (see section \n4.8). In the majority of patients, there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in total \ncholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering agents. \n \nIn RA and GCA patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks following \ninitiation of RoActemra therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical guidelines for \nmanagement of hyperlipidaemia. \n \nNeurological disorders \nPhysicians should be vigilant for symptoms potentially indicative of new-onset central demyelinating \ndisorders. The potential for central demyelination with RoActemra is currently unknown. \n \nMalignancy \nThe risk of malignancy is increased in patients with RA. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may \nincrease the risk of malignancy. \n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nVaccinations \nLive and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with RoActemra as clinical safety \nhas not been established. In a randomized open-label study, adult RA patients treated with RoActemra \nand MTX were able to mount an effective response to both the 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide and tetanus toxoid vaccines which was comparable to the response seen in patients on \nMTX only. It is recommended that all patients particularly elderly patients, be brought up to date with \nall immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating RoActemra \ntherapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of RoActemra therapy should be in \naccordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents. \n \nCardiovascular risk \nRA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and should have risk factors (e.g. \nhypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care. \n \nCombination with TNF antagonists \nThere is no experience with the use of RoActemra with TNF antagonists or other biological treatments \nfor RA patients. RoActemra is not recommended for use with other biological agents.  \n \nGCA \nRoActemra monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of acute relapses as efficacy in this \nsetting has not been established. Glucocorticoids should be given according to medical judgement and \npractice guidelines. \n \nsJIA \nMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a serious life-threatening disorder that may develop in \nsJIA patients. In clinical trials, RoActemra has not been studied in patients during an episode of active \nMAS.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nConcomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg RoActemra with 10-25 mg MTX once \nweekly had no clinically significant effect on MTX exposure. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on RoActemra clearance in RA patients. In GCA \npatients, no effect of cumulative corticosteroid dose on RoActemra exposure was observed. \n \nThe expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate \nchronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory \ntherapy, such as RoActemra, is introduced. \n \nIn vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in \nCYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. RoActemra normalises expression \nof these enzymes. \n \nIn a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following \na single dose of RoActemra, to the level similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy \nsubjects.  \n \nWhen starting or stopping therapy with RoActemra, patients taking medicinal products which are \nindividually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2 or 2C9 (e.g. methylprednisolone, \ndexamethasone, (with the possibility for oral glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome), atorvastatin, \ncalcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or \nbenzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic \n\n\n\n79 \n\neffect. Given its long elimination half-life (t1/2), the effect of RoActemra on CYP450 enzyme activity \nmay persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after \ntreatment. \n \nPregnancy  \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of RoActemra in pregnant women. A study in animals has \nshown an increased risk of spontaneous abortion/embryo-foetal death at a high dose (see section 5.3). \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n \nRoActemra should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether RoActemra is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of RoActemra in \nmilk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or \nto continue/discontinue therapy with RoActemra should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding to the child and the benefit of RoActemra therapy to the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAvailable non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under RoActemra treatment.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRoActemra has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8, dizziness). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile comes from 4510 patients exposed to RoActemra in clinical trials; the majority of \nthese patients were participating in RA studies (n=4009), while the remaining experience comes from \nGCA (n=149), pJIA (n=240) and sJIA (n=112)  studies. The safety profile of RoActemra across these \nindications remains similar and undifferentiated. \n \nThe most commonly reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) were upper respiratory tract infections, \nnasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT. \n \nThe most serious ADRs were serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity  \nreactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nADRs from clinical trials and/or post marketing experience with RoActemra based on spontaneous \ncase reports, literature cases and cases from non-interventional study programs are listed in Table 1 \nand are presented by MedDRA system organ class. The corresponding frequency category is based on \nthe following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100) rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nTable 1.

SC-I was a non-inferiority study that compared the efficacy and safety of RoActemra162 mg \nadministered every week versus 8 mg/kg intravenous in 1262 patients with RA. All patients received \nbackground non-biologic DMARD(s). The safety and immunogenicity observed for RoActemra \nadministered subcutaneous was consistent with the known safety profile of intravenous RoActemra \nand no new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1). A higher frequency of \ninjection site reactions was observed in the subcutaneous arms compared with placebo subcutaneous \ninjections in the intravenous arms.  \n \nInjection site reactions \nDuring the 6-month controlled period, in SC-I, the frequency of injection site reactions was 10.1% \n(64/631) and 2.4% (15/631) for the subcutaneous RoActemra and the subcutaneous placebo \n(intravenous group) weekly injections, respectively. These injection site reactions (including \nerythema, pruritus, pain and haematoma) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority was \nresolved without any treatment and none necessitated drug discontinuation. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn SC-I, a total of 625 patients treated with RoActemra 162mg weekly were tested for anti-RoActemra \nantibodies in the 6 month controlled period. Five patients (0.8%) developed positive anti-RoActemra \nantibodies; of these, all developed neutralizing anti-RoActemra antibodies. One patient was tested \npositive for IgE isotype (0.2%). \n \nIn SC-II, a total of 434 patients treated with RoActemra 162mg every other week were tested for anti-\nRoActemra antibodies in the 6 month controlled period. Seven patients (1.6%) developed positive \nanti-RoActemra antibodies; of these, six (1.4%) developed neutralizing anti-RoActemra antibodies. \nFour patients were tested positive for IgE isotype (0.9%). \n \nNo correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events was observed. \n \nHaematological abnormalities: \nNeutrophils \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 6 month controlled clinical trial SC-I, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count below 1 × 109/L occurred in 2.9% of patients on the subcutaneous weekly \ndose.  \n \nThere was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1 x 109/L and the occurrence \nof serious infections. \n \nPlatelets \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 6 month clinical trial SC-I, none of the \npatients on the SC weekly dose had a decrease in platelet count to ≤50 × 103 / μL. \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 6-month controlled clinical trial SC-I, \nelevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 6.5% and 1.4% of patients, respectively on the \nsubcutaneous weekly dose.  \n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nLipid parameters \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 6 month controlled clinical trial SC-I, 19% of \npatients experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol > 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), with 9% \nexperiencing a sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) on the subcutaneous weekly \ndose.  \n \nSubcutaneous Use  \nsJIA  \nThe safety profile of subcutaneous RoActemra was evaluated in 51 paediatric patients (1 to 17 years of \nage) with sJIA. In general, the adverse drug reactions in patients with sJIA were similar in type to \nthose seen in RA patients (see Undesirable Effects section above).  \n \nInfections \nThe rate of infection in sJIA patients treated with SC RoActemra was comparable to sJIA patients \ntreated with IV RoActemra. \n \nInjection Site Reactions (ISRs)  \nIn the SC Study (WA28118), a total of 41.2% (21/51) sJIA patients experienced ISRs to RoActemra \nSC. The most common ISRs were erythema, pruritus, pain, and swelling at the injection site. The \nmajority of ISRs reported were Grade 1 events and all ISRs reported were non-serious and none \nrequired patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the SC Study (WA28118), 46 of the 51 (90.2%) patients tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies at \nbaseline had at least one post-baseline screening assay result. No patient developed positive anti-\ntocilizumab antibodies post baseline.  \n \nLaboratory Abnormalities \nIn the 52-week open-label SC Study (WA28118), neutrophil count decrease to below 1 × 109/L \noccurred in 23.5% of patients treated with RoActemra SC. Decreases in platelet counts to below 100 × \n103/μL occurred in 2% of the patients treated with RoActemra SC. An elevation in ALT or AST to ≥3 \nx ULN occurred in 9.8% and 4.0% patients treated with RoActemra SC, respectively.  \n \nLipid parameters \nIn the 52-week open-label SC Study (WA28118), 23.4% and 35.4% of patients experienced a post-\nbaseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to \n≥200 mg/dL at any time during study treatment, respectively. \n \nSubcutaneous use \npJIA  \nThe safety profile of subcutaneous RoActemra was also evaluated in 52 paediatric patients with pJIA. \nThe total patient exposure to RoActemra in the pJIA all exposure population was 184.4 patient years \nfor IV and 50.4 patient years for SC tocilizumab. In general, the safety profile observed in patients \nwith pJIA was consistent with the known safety profile of RoActemra with the exception of ISRs (see \nTable 1). A higher frequency of pJIA patients experienced ISRs following SC RoActemra injections \ncompared to adult RA. \n \nInfections \nIn the SC RoActemra study, the rate of infection in pJIA patients treated with SC RoActemra was \ncomparable with pJIA patients treated with IV RoActemra. \n \nInjection Site Reactions \nA total of 28.8% (15/52) pJIA patients experienced ISRs to RoActemra SC. These ISRs occurred in a \n44% of patients ≥30 kg compared to 14.8% of patients below 30 kg.  The most common ISRs were \ninjection site erythema, swelling, hematoma, pain and pruritis. All ISRs reported were non-serious \nGrade 1 events, and none of the ISRs required patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption. \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nImmunogenicity \nIn the SC Study 5.8% [3/52] developed positive neutralizing anti-tocilizumab antibodies without \ndeveloping a serious or clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction. Of these 3 patients, 1 \nsubsequently withdrew from the study. No correlation between antibody development and clinical \nresponse or adverse events was observed \n \nLaboratory Abnormalities \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra all exposure population, a decrease in \nneutrophil count below 1 × 109/L occurred in 15.4% of patients treated with SC RoActemra. An \nelevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 9.6% and 3.8% patients treated with RoActemra SC, \nrespectively. No patients treated with SC RoActemra experienced a decrease in platelet count to ≤50 × \n103 / μL.  \n \nLipid parameters \nIn the SC Study, 14.3% and 12.8% of patients experienced a post-baseline elevation of their LDL-\ncholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to ≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during study \ntreatment, respectively. \n \nSubcutaneous Use \nGCAThe safety of subcutaneous RoActemra has been studied in one Phase III study (WA28119) with \n251 GCA patients. The total patient years duration in the RoActemra all exposure population was \n138.5 patient years during the 12 month double blind, placebo controlled phase of the study. The \noverall safety profile observed in the RoActemra treatment groups was consistent with the known \nsafety profile of RoActemra (see Table 1). \n \nInfections \nThe rate of infection/serious infection events was balanced between the RoActemra weekly group \n(200.2/9.7 events per 100 patient years) vs. placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper (156.0/4.2 events \nper 100 patient years) and placebo plus 52 weeks taper (210.2/12.5 events per 100 patient years) \ngroups.   \n \nInjection site reactions \nIn the RoActemra subcutaneous weekly group, a total of 6% (6/100) patients reported an adverse \nreaction occurring at the site of a subcutaneous injection. No injection site reaction was reported as a \nserious adverse event or required treatment discontinuation. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the RoActemra subcutaneous weekly group, one patient (1.1%, 1/95) developed positive \nneutralizing anti-RoActemra antibodies, though not of the IgE isotype. This patient did not develop a \nhypersensitivity reaction or injection site reaction. \n \nHaematological abnormalities: \nNeutrophils \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the Roactemra 12 month controlled clinical trial, a decrease in \nneutrophil count below 1 × 109/L occurred in 4% of patients in the RoActemra subcutaneous weekly \ngroup. This was not observed in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper groups. \n \nPlatelets \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 12 month controlled clinical trial, one patient \n(1%, 1/100) in the RoActemra subcutaneous weekly group had a single transient occurence of \ndecrease in platelet count to <100 × 103 / μL without associated bleeding events. A decrease in platelet \ncount below 100 × 103 / μL was not observed in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper groups. \n \n\n\n\n84 \n\nHepatic transaminase elevations \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 12 month controlled clinical trial, elevation in \nALT ≥3 x ULN occurred in 3% of patients in the RoActemra subcutaneous  weekly group compared \nto  2% in the placebo plus 52 week prednisone taper group and none in the placebo plus 26 week \nprednisone taper group. An elevation in AST > 3 ULN occurred in 1% of patients in the RoActemra \nsubcutaneous weekly group, compared to no patients in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper \ngroups. \n \nLipid parameters \nDuring routine laboratory monitoring in the RoActemra 12 month controlled clinical trial, 34% of \npatients experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol > 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), with 15% \nexperiencing a sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) in the RoActemra \nsubcutaneous weekly group.  \n \nIntravenous use \nRA \nThe safety of RoActemra has been studied in 4 placebo-controlled studies (studies II, III, IV and V), 1 \nMTX-controlled study (study I) and their extension periods (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe double-blind controlled period was 6 months in four studies (studies I, III, IV and V) and was up \nto 2 years in one study (study II). In the double-blind controlled studies, 774 patients received \nRoActemra 4 mg/kg in combination with MTX, 1870 patients received RoActemra 8 mg/kg in \ncombination with MTX or other DMARDs and 288 patients received RoActemra 8 mg/kg \nmonotherapy.  \n \nThe long-term exposure population includes all patients who received at least one dose of RoActemra \neither in the double-blind control period or open label extension phase in the studies. Of the 4009 \npatients in this population, 3577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3296 for at least one year, \n2806 received treatment for at least 2 years and 1222 for 3 years. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections  \nIn the 6-month controlled studies the rate of all infections reported with RoActemra8 mg/kg plus \nDMARD treatment was 127 events per 100 patient years compared to 112 events per 100 patient years \nin the placebo plus DMARD group. In the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of \ninfections with RoActemra was 108 events per 100 patient years exposure. \n \nIn 6-month controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections with RoActemra8 mg/kg plus \nDMARDs was 5.3 events per 100 patient years exposure compared to 3.9 events per 100 patient years \nexposure in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the monotherapy study the rate of serious infections \nwas 3.6 events per 100 patient years of exposure in the RoActemra group and 1.5 events per \n100 patient years of exposure in the MTX group.  \n \nIn the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of serious infections (bacterial, viral and fungal) \nwas 4.7 events per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections, some with fatal outcome, included \nactive tuberculosis, which may present with intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary disease, invasive \npulmonary infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis and pneumocystis \njirovecii, pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial \narthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported. \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nImpaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections. There have been post-\nmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of \nwhich had fatal outcomes. \n \n\n\n\n85 \n\nGastrointestinal perforation \nDuring the 6-month controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was \n0.26 events per 100 patient years with RoActemra therapy. In the long-term exposure population the \noverall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.28 events per 100 patient years. Reports of \ngastrointestinal perforation on RoActemrawere primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis \nincluding generalised purulent peritonitis, lower gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae and abscess. \n \nInfusion reactions  \nIn the 6-month controlled trials adverse events associated with infusion (selected events occurring \nduring or within 24 hours of infusion) were reported by 6.9% of patients in the RoActemra 8 mg/kg \nplus DMARD group and 5.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Events reported during \nthe infusion were primarily episodes of hypertension; events reported within 24 hours of finishing an \ninfusion were headache and skin reactions (rash, urticaria). These events were not treatment limiting. \n \nThe rate of anaphylactic reactions (occurring in a total of 8/4,009 patients, 0.2%) was several fold \nhigher with the 4 mg/kg dose, compared to the 8 mg/kg dose. Clinically significant hypersensitivity \nreactions associated with RoActemra and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported in a total \nof 56 out of 4,009 patients (1.4%) treated with RoActemra during the controlled and open label \nclinical studies. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fifth infusions of \nRoActemra (see section 4.4). Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported after marketing authorisation during \ntreatment with intravenous RoActemra (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunogenicity  \nA total of 2,876 patients have been tested for anti-RoActemra antibodies in the 6-month controlled \nclinical trials. Of the 46 patients (1.6%) who developed anti-RoActemra antibodies, 6 had an \nassociated medically significant hypersensitivity reaction, of which 5 led to permanent discontinuation \nof treatment. Thirty patients (1.1%) developed neutralising antibodies.  \n \nHaematological abnormalities: \nNeutrophils \nIn the 6-month controlled trials decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 109/ L occurred in 3.4% of \npatients on RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to < 0.1% of patients on placebo plus \nDMARDs. Approximately half of the patients who developed an ANC < 1 x 109/ L did so within 8 \nweeks after starting therapy. Decreases below 0.5 x 109/ L were reported in 0.3% patients receiving \nRoActemra8 mg/kg plus DMARDs. Infections with neutropenia have been reported.  \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \ndecreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled \nclinical trials. \n \nPlatelets \nIn the 6-month controlled trials decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 103/ μL occurred in 1.7% of \npatients on RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to < 1% on placebo plus DMARDs. These \ndecreases occurred without associated bleeding events. \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \ndecreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical \ntrials. \n \nVery rare reports of pancytopenia have occurred in the post marketing setting. \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \nDuring the 6-month controlled trials transient elevations in ALT/AST > 3 x ULN were observed in \n2.1% of patients on RoActemra 8 mg/kg compared to 4.9% of patients on MTX and in 6.5% of \npatients who received 8 mg/kg RoActemra plus DMARDs compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo \nplus DMARDs. \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nThe addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to RoActemra monotherapy resulted in \nincreased frequency of these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST > 5 x ULN were observed in 0.7% of \nRoActemra monotherapy patients and 1.4% of RoActemra plus DMARD patients, the majority of \nwhom were discontinued permanently from RoActemra treatment. During the double-blind controlled \nperiod, the incidence of indirect bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal, collected as a routine \nlaboratory parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated with 8 mg/kg RoActemra+ DMARD. A total of 5.8% \nof patients experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin of > 1 to 2 x ULN and 0.4% had an elevation \nof > 2 x ULN. \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \nelevation in ALT/AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical \ntrials. \n \nLipid parameters \nDuring the 6-month controlled trials, increases of lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, \ntriglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or HDL cholesterol have been reported commonly. With routine \nlaboratory monitoring it was seen that approximately 24% of patients receiving RoActemra in clinical \ntrials experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol ≥ 6.2 mmol/ l, with 15% experiencing a \nsustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/ L. Elevations in lipid parameters responded to treatment \nwith lipid-lowering agents. \n \nDuring the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of \nelevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled trials. \n \nMalignancies \nThe clinical data are insufficient to assess the potential incidence of malignancy following exposure to \nRoActemra. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing. \n \nSkin Reactions \nRare reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have occurred in the post marketing setting. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorization of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are limited data available on overdose with RoActemra. One case of accidental overdose was \nreported in which a patient with multiple myeloma received a single dose of 40 mg/kg administered \nintravenously. No adverse reactions were observed.  \n \nNo serious adverse reactions were observed in healthy volunteers who received a single dose up to \n28 mg/kg, although dose limiting neutropenia was observed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosupressants, Interleukin inhibitors; ATC code: L04AC07. \n \nMechanism of action \nRoActemra binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and \nmIL-6R). RoActemra has been shown to inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. IL-6 is a \npleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n87 \n\nmonocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 is involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell \nactivation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, induction of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis \nand stimulation of haemopoiesis. IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases including \ninflammatory diseases, osteoporosis and neoplasia.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn RA clinical studies with RoActemra, rapid decreases in CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), \nserum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen were observed. Consistent with the effect on acute phase \nreactants, treatment with RoActemra was associated with reduction in platelet count within the normal \nrange. Increases in haemoglobin levels were observed, through RoActemra decreasing the IL-6 driven \neffects on hepcidin production to increase iron availability. In RoActemra-treated patients, decreases \nin the levels of CRP to within normal ranges were seen as early as week 2, with decreases maintained \nwhile on treatment. \n \nIn GCA clinical study WA28119, similar rapid decreases in CRP and ESR were observed along with \nslight increases in mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. In healthy subjects administered \nRoActemra in doses from 2 to 28 mg/kg intravenously and 81 to 162 mg subcutaneously, absolute \nneutrophil counts decreased to their lowest 2 to 5 days following administration. Thereafter, \nneutrophils recovered towards baseline in a dose dependent manner. RA and GCA patients \ndemonstrate a comparable (to healthy subjects) decrease of absolute neutrophil counts following \nRoActemra administration (see section 4.8). \n \nSubcutaneous use \nRA \nClinical efficacy  \nThe efficacy of subcutaneous administered RoActemra in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA \nand radiographic response, was assessed in two randomised, double-blind, controlled, multi-center \nstudies. For study I (SC-I), patients were required to be >18 years of age with moderate to severe \nactive RA diagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 4 tender and 4 swollen joints at \nbaseline. All patients received background non-biologic DMARD(s). For study II (SC-II), patients \nwere required to be > 18 years of age with moderate to severe active RA diagnosed according to ACR \ncriteria who had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline. \n \nSwitching from 8 mg/kg intravenous once every 4 weeks to 162 mg subcutaneous once every week, \nwill alter exposure in the patient. The extent varies with the patient’s body weight (increased in light \nbody weight patients and decreased in heavy body weight patients) but clinical outcome is consistent \nwith that observed in intravenous treated patients. \n \nClinical response \nStudy SC-I evaluated patients with moderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate clinical \nresponse to their existing rheumatologic therapy, including one or more DMARD(s) where \napproximately 20% had a history of inadequate response to at least one TNF inhibitor. In SC-I, \n1262 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive RoActemra subcutaneous 162 mg every week or \nRoActemra intravenous 8 mg/kg every four weeks in combination with non-biologic DMARD(s). The \nprimary endpoint in the study was the difference in the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 \nresponse at week 24. The results from study SC-I is shown in Table 2. \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\nTable 2.

At week 24, a significant reduction in DAS28 from \nbaseline (mean improvement) of 3.5 was observed on both treatment arms, and a comparable \nproportion of patients had achieved DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) on the subcutaneous \n(38.4%) and IV (36.9%) arms. \n \nRadiographic response  \nThe radiographic response of subcutaneous administered RoActemra was assessed in a double-blind, \ncontrolled, multicenter study in patients with active RA (SC-II). Study SC-II evaluated patients with \nmoderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate clinical response to their existing rheumatologic \ntherapy, including one or more DMARD(s) where approximately 20% had a history of inadequate \nresponse to at least one TNF inhibitor. Patients were required to be >18 years of age with active RA \ndiagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline. In SC-\nII, 656 patients were randomized 2:1 to RoActemra subcutaneous 162 mg every other week or \nplacebo, in combination with non-biologic DMARD(s). \n \nIn study SC-II, inhibition of structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as a \nchange from baseline in the van der Heijde modified mean total Sharp score (mTSS). At week 24, \ninhibition of structural damage was shown, with significantly less radiographic progression in patients \nreceiving RoActemra subcutaneous compared to placebo (mean mTSS of 0.62 vs. 1.23, p=0.0149 (van \nElteren). These results are consistent with those observed in patients treated with intravenous \nRoActemra. \n \nIn study SC-II, at week 24 there was ACR20 of 60.9%, ACR50 of 39.8% and ACR70 of 19.7% for \npatients treated with RoActemra subcutaneous every other week versus placebo ACR20 of 31.5%, \nACR50 of 12.3% and ACR70 of 5.0%. Patients had mean DAS28 at baseline of 6.7 on subcutaneous \nand 6.6 on placebo arms. At week 24, a significant reduction in DAS28 from baseline of 3.1 was \nobserved on subcutaneous and 1.7 on placebo arm, and for DAS28 < 2.6, 32.0% was observed on \nsubcutaneous and 4.0% on placebo arm. \n \nHealth-related and quality of life outcomes \nIn study SC-I, the mean decrease in HAQ-DI from baseline to week 24 was 0.6 on both the \nsubcutaneous and intravenous arms. The proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant \nimprovement in HAQ-DI at week 24 (change from baseline of ≥ 0.3 units) was also comparable on the \nsubcutaneous (65.2%) versus intravenous (67.4%) arms, with a weighted difference in proportions \nof - 2.3% (95% CI - 8.1, 3.4). For SF-36, the mean change from baseline at week 24 in the mental \n\n\n\n89 \n\ncomponent score was 6.22 for the subcutaneous arm and 6.54 for the intravenous arm, and for the \nphysical component score was also similar with 9.49 for the subcutaneous arm and 9.65 for the \nintravenous arm. \n \nIn study SC-II, mean decrease in HAQ-DI from baseline to week 24 was significantly greater for \npatients treated with RoActemra subcutaneous every other week (0.4) versus placebo (0.3). Proportion \nof patients achieving a clinically relevant improvement in HAQ-DI at week 24 (change from baseline \nof ≥ 0.3 units) was higher for RoActemra subcutaneous every other week (58%) versus placebo \n(46.8%). SF-36 (mean change in mental and physical component scores) was significantly greater with \nRoActemra subcutaneous group (6.5 and 5.3) versus placebo (3.8 and 2.9). \n \nSubcutaneous Use \nsJIA \nClinical Efficacy \nA 52-week, open-label, multi-centre, PK/PD and safety study (WA28118) was conducted in paediatric \npatients with sJIA, aged 1 to 17 years, to determine the appropriate SC dose of RoActemra that \nachieved comparable PK/PD and safety profiles to the IV regimen.  \n \nEligible patients received RoActemra dosed according to body weight (BW), with patients weighing \n≥30 kg (n=26) dosed with 162 mg of RoActemra every week (QW) and patients weighing below \n30 kg (n=25) dosed with 162 mg of RoActemra every 10 days (Q10D; n=8) or every 2 weeks (Q2W; \nn=17) for 52 weeks. Of these 51 patients, 26 (51%) were naive to RoActemra and 25 (49%) had been \nreceiving RoActemra IV and switched to RoActemra SC at baseline.   \n \nExploratory efficacy results showed that RoActemra SC improved all exploratory efficacy parameters \nincluding Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-71, for TCZ naïve patients and \nmaintained all exploratory efficacy parameters for patients who switched from RoActemra IV to \nRoActemra SC treatment over the entire course of the study for patients in both body weight groups \n(below 30 kg and ≥30 kg). \n \nSubcutaneous Use \npJIA  \nClinical Efficacy \nA 52-week, open-label, multicenter, PK-PD and safety study was conducted in paediatric patients with \npJIA, aged 1 to 17 years old, to determine the appropriate subcutaneous dose of RoActemra that \nachieved comparable PK/PD and safety profiles to the IV regimen. \n \nEligible patients received tocilizumab dosed according to body weight (BW), with patients \nweighing  ≥30 kg (n = 25) dosed with 162 mg of RoActemra every 2 weeks (Q2W) and patients \nweighing below 30 kg (n = 27) dosed with 162 mg of RoActemra every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 52 weeks.  \nOf these 52 patients, 37 (71%) were naive to RoActemra and 15 (29%) had been receiving RoActemra \nIV and switched to RoActemra SC at baseline.   \n \nThe RoActemra SC regimens of 162 mg Q3W for patients weighing below 30 kg and of 162 mg Q2W \nfor patients weighing ≥ 30 kg respectively provide PK exposure and PD responses to support efficacy \nand safety outcomes similar to those achieved with the approved RoActemra IV regimens for pJIA. \n \nExploratory efficacy results showed that RoActemra SC improved median Juvenile Arthritis Disease \nActivity Score (JADAS)-71 for RoActemra naïve patients and maintained the median JADAS-71 for \npatients who switched from IV to SC RoActemra treatment over the entire course of the study for \npatients in both body weight groups (below 30 kg and ≥ 30 kg). \n \nSubcutaneous Use \nGCA  \nClinical efficacy \nStudy WA28119 was a randomized, multi-center, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III \nsuperiority study conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of RoActemra in patients with GCA.  \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \nTwo hundred and fifty one (251) patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA were enrolled and \nassigned to one of four treatment arms. The study consisted of a 52-week blinded period (Part 1), \nfollowed by a 104-week open-label extension (Part 2). The purpose of Part 2 was  to describe the \nlong-term safety and maintenance of efficacy after 52 weeks of RoActemra therapy, to explore the rate \nof relapse and the requirement for RoActemra therapy beyond 52 weeks, and to gain insight into the \npotential long-term steroid-sparing effect of RoActemra. \n \nTwo subcutaneous doses of RoActemra (162 mg every week and 162 mg every other week) were \ncompared to two different placebo control groups randomised 2:1:1:1. \n \nAll patients received background glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy. Each of the RoActemra-treated \ngroups and one of the placebo-treated groups followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over \n26 weeks, while the second placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen \nover 52 weeks, designed to be more in keeping with standard practice.  \n \nThe duration of glucocorticoid therapy during screening and before RoActemra (or placebo) was \ninitiated, was similar in all 4 treatment groups (see Table 3). \n \nTable 3.

RoActemra subcutaneous weekly dose also showed a clinically meaningful decrease in the risk \nfor flare compared to placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone in patients who entered the trial with relapsing \nGCA as well as those with new-onset disease (Table 4).   \n \n\n\n\n91 \n\nCumulative glucocorticoid dose  \nThe cumulative prednisone dose at week 52 was significantly lower in the two RoActemra dose \ngroups compared to the two placebo groups (Table 4). In a separate analysis of the patients who \nreceived escape prednisone to treat GCA flare during the first 52 weeks, the cumulative prednisone \ndose varied greatly.  The median doses for escape patients in the RoActemra weekly and every other \nweekly groups were 3129.75 mg and 3847 mg, respectively. Both considerably lower than in the \nplacebo plus 26 weeks and the placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper groups, 4023.5 mg and \n5389.5 mg respectively. \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\nTable 4.

The PCS mean change from baseline to week 52 was \nhigher (showing more improvement) in the RoActemra weekly and every other weekly dose groups \n[4.10, 2.76, respectively] than in the two placebo groups [placebo plus 26 weeks; -0.28, placebo plus \n52 weeks; -1.49], although only the comparison between RoActemra weekly plus 26 weeks \nprednisone taper group and placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper group (5.59, 99% CI: 8.6, 10.32) \nshowed a statistically significant difference (p=0.0024).  For MCS, the mean change from baseline to \nweek 52 for both RoActemra weekly and every other weekly dose groups [7.28, 6.12, respectively] \nwere higher than the placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper group [2.84] (although the differences \nwere not statistically significant [weekly p=0.0252 for weekly, p=0.1468 for every other weekly]) and \nsimilar to the placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group [6.67].  \n \nThe Patient’s Global Assessment of disease activity was assessed on a 0-100mm Visual Analogue \nScale (VAS). The mean change in Patient’s global VAS from baseline at week 52 was lower (showing \ngreater improvement) in the RoActemra weekly and every other weekly dose groups [-19.0, -25.3, \nrespectively] than in both placebo  groups [placebo plus 26 weeks -3.4, placebo plus 52 weeks -7.2], \nalthough only the RoActemra every other weekly plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group showed a \nstatistically significant difference compared to placebo [placebo plus 26 weeks taper p=0.0059, and \nplacebo plus 52 weeks taper p=0.0081]. \n \nFACIT-Fatigue change from baseline to week 52 scores were calculated for all groups.  The mean \n[SD] change scores were as follows: RoActemra weekly plus 26 weeks 5.61 [10.115], RoActemra \nevery other weekly plus 26 weeks 1.81 [8.836], placebo plus 26 weeks 0.26 [10.702], and placebo plus \n52 weeks -1.63 [6.753].  \n \nChange in EQ5D scores from baseline to week 52 were RoActemra weekly plus 26 weeks 0.10 \n[0.198], RoActemra every other weekly plus 26 weeks 0.05 [0.215], placebo plus 26 weeks 0.07 \n[0.293], and placebo plus 52 weeks -0.02 [0.159]. \n \nHigher scores signal improvement in both FACIT-Fatigue and EQ5D. \n \nIntravenous use \nRA \nClinical efficacy  \nThe efficacy of RoActemra in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA was assessed in five \nrandomised, double-blind, multi-centre studies. Studies I-V enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with \nactive RA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and who had \nat least eight tender and six swollen joints at baseline.  \n \nIn Study I, RoActemra was administered intravenously every four weeks as monotherapy. In Studies \nII, III and V, RoActemra was administered intravenously every four weeks in combination with MTX \nvs. placebo and MTX. In Study IV, RoActemra was administered intravenously every 4 weeks in \ncombination with other DMARDs vs. placebo and other DMARDs. The primary endpoint for each of \nthe five studies was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.  \n \nStudy I evaluated 673 patients who had not been treated with MTX within six months prior to \nrandomisation and who had not discontinued previous MTX treatment as a result of clinically \nimportant toxic effects or lack of response. The majority (67%) of patients were MTX-naïve. Doses of \n8 mg/kg of RoActemra were given every four weeks as monotherapy. The comparator group was \nweekly MTX (dose titrated from 7.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg weekly over an eight week period).  \n \n\n\n\n94 \n\nStudy II, a two year study with planned analyses at week 24, week 52 and week 104, evaluated \n1196 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg of RoActemra \nor placebo were given every four weeks as blinded therapy for 52 weeks in combination with stable \nMTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly). After week 52, all patients could receive open-label treatment with \nRoActemra 8 mg/kg. Of the patients who completed the study who were originally randomised to \nplacebo + MTX, 86% received open-label RoActemra 8 mg/kg in year 2. The primary endpoint at \nweek 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At week 52 and week 104 \nthe co-primary endpoints were prevention of joint damage and improvement in physical function. \n \nStudy III evaluated 623 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or \n8 mg/kg RoActemra or placebo were given every four weeks, in combination with stable MTX (10 mg \nto 25 mg weekly).  \n \nStudy IV evaluated 1,220 patients who had an inadequate response to their existing rheumatologic \ntherapy, including one or more DMARDs. Doses of 8 mg/kg RoActemra or placebo were given every \nfour weeks in combination with stable DMARDs.  \n \nStudy V evaluated 499 patients who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or \nmore TNF antagonist therapies. The TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued prior to randomisation. \nDoses of 4 or 8 mg/kg RoActemra or placebo were given every four weeks in combination with stable \nMTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly).  \n \nClinical response \nIn all studies, patients treated with RoActemra 8 mg/kg had statistically significant higher ACR 20, 50, \n70 response rates at 6 months compared to control (Table 5). In study I, superiority of RoActemra \n8 mg/kg was demonstrated against the active comparator MTX. \n \nThe treatment effect was similar in patients independent of rheumatoid factor status, age, gender, race, \nnumber of prior treatments or disease status. Time to onset was rapid (as early as week 2) and the \nmagnitude of response continued to improve with duration of treatment. Continued durable responses \nwere seen for over 3 years in the ongoing open label extension studies I-V.  \n \nIn patients treated with RoActemra 8 mg/kg, significant improvements were noted on all individual \ncomponents of the ACR response including: tender and swollen joint counts; patients and physician \nglobal assessment; disability index scores; pain assessment and CRP compared to patients receiving \nplacebo plus MTX or other DMARDs in all studies.  \n \nPatients in studies I – V had a mean Disease Activity Score (DAS28) of 6.5–6.8 at baseline. \nSignificant reduction in DAS28 from baseline (mean improvement) of 3.1–3.4 were observed in \nRoActemra-treated patients compared to control patients (1.3-2.1). The proportion of patients \nachieving a DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) was significantly higher in patients receiving \nRoActemra (28–34%) compared to 1–12% of control patients at 24 weeks. In study II, 65% of patients \nachieved a DAS28 < 2.6 at week 104 compared to 48% at 52 weeks and 33% of patients at week 24. \n \nIn a pooled analysis of studies II, III and IV, the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50 and \n70 response was significantly higher (59% vs. 50%, 37% vs. 27%, 18% vs. 11%, respectively) in the \nRoActemra 8 mg/kg plus DMARD vs. the RoActemra 4 mg/kg plus DMARD group (p< 0.03). \nSimilarly the proportion of patients achieving a DAS 28 remission (DAS28 < 2.6) was significantly \nhigher (31% vs. 16% respectively) in patients receiving RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus DMARD than in \npatients receiving RoActemra 4 mg/kg plus DMARD (p< 0.0001). \n \n\n\n\n95 \n\nTable 5.

Inhibition of joint structural damage was shown with \nsignificantly less radiographic progression in patients receiving RoActemra compared to control \n(Table 6). \n \nIn the open-label extension of Study II the inhibition of progression of structural joint damage in \nRoActemra plus MTX-treated patients was maintained in the second year of treatment. The mean \nchange from baseline at week 104 in total Sharp-Genant score was significantly lower for patients \nrandomised to RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus MTX (p<0.0001) compared with patients who were \nrandomised to placebo plus MTX. \n \n\n\n\n96 \n\nTable 6.

This remained consistent \nfollowing 2 years of treatment (83%; n=353). Ninety three percent (93%; n=271) of patients had no \nprogression between week 52 and week 104. \n \nHealth-related and quality of life outcomes \nRoActemra-treated patients reported an improvement in all patient-reported outcomes (Health \nAssessment Questionnaire Disability Index - HAQ-DI), Short Form-36 and Functional Assessment of \nChronic Illness Therapy questionnaires. Statistically significant improvements in HAQ-DI scores were \nobserved in patients treated with RoActemra compared with patients treated with DMARDs. During \nthe open-label period of Study II, the improvement in physical function has been maintained for up to \n2 years. At Week 52, the mean change in HAQ-DI was -0.58 in the RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus MTX \ngroup compared with -0.39 in the placebo + MTX group. The mean change in HAQ-DI was \nmaintained at Week 104 in the RoActemra 8 mg/kg plus MTX group (-0.61). \n \nHaemoglobin levels  \nStatistically significant improvements in haemoglobin levels were observed with RoActemra \ncompared with DMARDs (p< 0.0001) at week 24. Mean haemoglobin levels increased by week 2 and \nremained within normal range through to week 24.  \n \nTocilizumab versus adalimumab in monotherapy \nStudy VI (WA19924), a 24 week double-blinded study that compared RoActemra monotherapy with \nadalimumab monotherapy, evaluated 326 patients with RA who were intolerant of MTX or where \ncontinued treatment with MTX was considered inappropriate (including MTX inadequate responders). \nPatients in the RoActemra arm received an intravenous (IV) infusion of RoActemra (8 mg/kg) every \n4 weeks (q4w) and a subcutaneous (SC) placebo injection every 2 weeks (q2w). Patients in the \nadalimumab arm received an adalimumab SC injection (40 mg) q2w plus an IV placebo infusion q4w. \nA statistically significant superior treatment effect was seen in favour of RoActemra over adalimumab \nin control of disease activity from baseline to week 24 for the primary endpoint of change in DAS28 \nand for all secondary endpoints (Table 7). \n \n\n\n\n97 \n\nTable 7: Efficacy Results for Study VI (WA19924) \n \n\n \n\nADA + Placebo \n(IV) \n\nN = 162 \n\nTCZ + Placebo \n(SC) \n\nN = 163 p-value(a) \nPrimary Endpoint - Mean Change from baseline at Week 24 \n\nDAS28 (adjusted mean)  -1.8 -3.3   \nDifference in adjusted mean (95% \n\nCI) \n-1.5 (-1.8, -1.1) <0.0001 \n\nSecondary Endpoints - Percentage of Responders at Week 24 (b) \nDAS28 < 2.6, n (%) 17 (10.5) 65 (39.9) <0.0001 \nDAS28 ≤ 3.2, n (%)  32 (19.8)  84 (51.5) <0.0001 \n\nACR20 response, n (%) 80 (49.4) 106 (65.0) 0.0038 \nACR50 response, n (%) 45 (27.8) 77 (47.2) 0.0002 \nACR70 response, n (%) 29 (17.9) 53 (32.5) 0.0023 \n\nap value is adjusted for region and duration of RA for all endpoints and additionally baseline value for all continuous \nendpoints. \nb Non-responder Imputation used for missing data. Multiplicity controlled using Bonferroni-Holm Procedure \n \nThe overall clinical adverse event profile was similar between RoActemra and adalimumab. The \nproportion of patients with serious adverse events was balanced between the treatment groups \n(RoActemra 11.7% vs. adalimumab 9.9%). The types of adverse drug reactions in the RoActemra arm \nwere consistent with the known safety profile of RoActemra and adverse drug reactions were reported \nat a similar frequency compared with Table 1. A higher incidence of infections and infestations was \nreported in the RoActemra arm (48% vs. 42%), with no difference in the incidence of serious \ninfections (3.1%). Both study treatments induced the same pattern of changes in laboratory safety \nparameters (decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts, increases in ALT, AST and lipids), however, \nthe magnitude of change and the frequency of marked abnormalities was higher with RoActemra \ncompared with adalimumab. Four (2.5%) patients in the RoActemra arm and two (1.2%) patients in \nthe adalimumab arm experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decreases. Eleven (6.8%) patients \nin the RoActemra arm and five (3.1%) patients in the adalimumab arm experienced ALT increases of \nCTC grade 2 or higher. The mean LDL increase from baseline was 0.64 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) for \npatients in the RoActemra arm and 0.19 mmol/L (7 mg/dL) for patients in the adalimumab arm. The \nsafety observed in the RoActemra arm was consistent with the known safety profile of RoActemra and \nno new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra is characterized by nonlinear elimination which is a combination \nof linear clearance and Michaelis-Menten elimination.  The nonlinear part of RoActemra elimination \nleads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional.  The pharmacokinetic parameters \nof RoActemra do not change with time. Due to the dependence of total clearance on RoActemra serum \nconcentrations, the half-life of RoActemra is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on \nthe serum concentration level. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so \nfar indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies.  \n \nRA \nIntravenous use \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on \na database composed of 3552 RA patients treated with a one-hour infusion of 4 or 8 mg/kg RoActemra \nevery 4 weeks for 24 weeks or with 162 mg RoActemra given subcutaneously either once a week or \nevery other week for 24 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n98 \n\nThe following parameters (predicted mean ± SD) were estimated for a dose of 8 mg/kg RoActemra \ngiven every 4 weeks: steady-state area under curve (AUC) = 38000 ± 13000 h µg/mL, trough \nconcentration (Cmin) = 15.9 ± 13.1 µg/mL and maximum concentration (Cmax) = 182 ± 50.4 µg/mL, \nand. the accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax were small, 1.32 and 1.09, respectively. The \naccumulation ratio was higher for Cmin (2.49), which was expected based on the non-linear clearance \ncontribution at lower concentrations. Steady-state was reached following the first administration for \nCmax and after 8 and 20 weeks for AUC and Cmin, respectively. RoActemra AUC, Cmin and Cmax \nincreased with increase of body weight. At body weight ≥ 100 kg, the predicted mean (± SD) steady-\nstate AUC, Cmin and Cmax of RoActemra were 50000 ± 16800 μg•h/mL, 24.4 ± 17.5 μg/mL, and 226 \n± 50.3 μg/mL, respectively, which are higher than mean exposure values for the patient population \n(i.e. all body weights) reported above. The dose-response curve for RoActemra flattens at higher \nexposure, resulting in smaller efficacy gains for each incremental increase in RoActemra concentration \nsuch that clinically meaningful increases in efficacy were not demonstrated in patients treated with > \n800 mg of RoActemra. Therefore, RoActemra doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not \nrecommended (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nIn RA patients the central volume of distribution was 3.72, the peripheral volume of distribution was \n3.35 resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.07.  \n \nElimination \nFollowing intravenous administration, RoActemra undergoes biphasic elimination from the \ncirculation. The total clearance of RoActemra was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the \nlinear and non-linear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population \npharmacokinetic analysis and was 9.5 mL/h. The concentration-dependent non-linear clearance plays a \nmajor role at low RoActemra concentrations. Once the non-linear clearance pathway is saturated, at \nhigher RoActemra concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance.  \nThe t1/2 of RoActemra was concentration-dependent. At steady-state following a dose of 8 mg/kg \nevery 4 weeks, the effective t1/2 decreased with decreasing concentrations within a dosing interval \nfrom 18 days to 6 days. \n \nLinearity \nPharmacokinetic parameters of RoActemra did not change with time. A more than dose-proportional \nincrease in the AUC and Cmin was observed for doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Cmax increased \ndose-proportionally. At steady-state, predicted AUC and Cmin were 3.2 and 30 fold higher at 8 mg/kg \nas compared to 4 mg/kg, respectively. \n \nSubcutaneous use \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on \na database composed of 3552 RA patients treated with 162 mg subcutaneous every week, 162 mg \nsubcutaneous every other week, and or 4 or 8 mg/kg intravenous every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of RoActemra did not change with time. For the 162 mg every week \ndose, the predicted mean (±SD) steady-state AUC1week, Cmin and Cmax of RoActemra were \n7970 ± 3432 µg•h/mL, 43.0 ± 19.8 µg/mL, and 49.8 ± 21.0 µg /mL, respectively. The accumulation \nratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.32, 6.30, and 5.27, respectively. Steady state was reached after \n12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax. \n \nFor the 162 every other week dose, the predicted mean (±SD) steady-state AUC2week, Cmin, and \nCmax of RoActemra were 3430 ± 2660 µg•h/mL, 5.7 ± 6.8 µg/mL, and 13.2 ± 8.8 µg/mL, \nrespectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 6.02, and 2.12, respectively. \nSteady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax. \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing subcutaneous dosing in RA patients, the time to peak serum RoActemra concentrations tmax \nwas 2.8 days. The bioavailability for the subcutaneous formulation was 79%. \n \n\n\n\n99 \n\nElimination \nFor subcutaneous administration, the concentration-dependent apparent t 1/2 is up to 12 days for \n162 mg every week and 5 days for 162 mg every other week in patients with RA at steady-state. \n \nsJIA \nSubcutaneous Use \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra in sJIA patients was characterized by a population \npharmacokinetic analysis which included 140 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 2 \nweeks (patients weighing ≥30 kg), 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), \n162 mg SC every week (patients weighing ≥30 kg), 162 mg SC every 10 days or every 2 weeks \n(patients weighing below 30 kg).  \n \nLimited data are available regarding exposures following subcutaneous administration of RoActemra \nin sJIA patients below 2 years of age with a body weight less than 10 kg.  \n \nPatients with sJIA must have a minimum body weight of 10 kg when receiving RoActemra \nsubcutaneously (see section 4.2). \n \nTable 8.

The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population \npharmacokinetic analysis and was 5.7 mL/h in paediatric patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic \narthritis. Following subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 of RoActemra in sJIA patients is up \nto 14 days for both the 162 mg QW and Q2W regimens during a dosing interval at steady state.  \n \npJIA  \nSubcutaneous use \nThe pharmacokinetics of RoActemra in pJIA patients was characterized by a population \npharmacokinetic analysis which included 237 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 4 \nweeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), \n162 mg SC every 2 weeks (patients weighing   ≥ 30 kg), or 162 mg SC every 3 weeks (patients \nweighing   below 30 kg). \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \nTable 9.

After SC dosing, approximately \n90% of the steady-state was reached by Week 12 for both the 162 mg SC Q2W and Q3W regimens. \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing SC dosing in pJIA patients, the absorption half-life was around 2 days, and the \nbioavailability for the SC formulation in pJIA patients was 96%. \n \nDistribution \nIn paediatric patients with pJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.97 L, the peripheral volume \nof distribution was 2.03 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.0 L. \n \nElimination \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis for pJIA patients showed body size related impact on linear \nclearance so that body-weight based dosing should be taken into consideration (see Table 9).  \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 of RoActemra in pJIA patients is up to 10 days for \npatients < 30 kg (162 mg SC Q3W) and up to 7 days for patients >= 30 kg (162 mg SC Q2W)  during \na dosing interval at steady state. Following intravenous administration, tocilizumab undergoes \nbiphasic elimination from the circulation. The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentration-\ndependent and is the sum of the linear and non-linear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as \na parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and was 6.25 mL/h. The concentration-\ndependent non-linear clearance plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the non-\nlinear clearance pathway is saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly \ndetermined by the linear clearance. \n \nGCA \nSubcutaneous use \nThe PK of RoActemra  in GCA patients were determined using a population PK model from an \nanalysis dataset composed of 149 GCA patients treated with 162 mg subcutaneous every week or \n162 mg subcutaneous every other week.  The developed model had the same structure as the \npopulation PK model developed earlier based on data from RA patients (see Table 10). \n\n \n\n\n\n101 \n\nTable 10. Predicted mean ± SD PK parameters at steady-state after subcutaneous dosing in GCA \n \n\n \nSubcutaneous \n\nTocilizumab PK Parameter 162 mg every other weekly 162 mg weekly \n\nCmax (µg/mL) 19.3 ± 12.8 73 ± 30.4 \n\nCtrough (µg/mL) 11.1 ± 10.3 68.1± 29.5 \n\nCmean (µg/mL)  16.2 ± 11.8 71.3 ± 30.1 \n\nAccumulation Cmax 2.18  8.88 \n\nAccumulation Ctrough 5.61 9.59 \n\nAccumulation Cmean or AUCτ * 2.81 10.91 \n\n*τ = 2 week or 1 week for the two SC regimens \n \nThe steady-state profile following the RoActemra weekly dose was almost flat, with very little \nfluctuations between trough and peak values, while there were substantial fluctuations for the \nRoActemra every other weekly dose. Approximately 90% of the steady-state (AUCτ) was reached by \nweek 14 in the every other weekly and week 17 in the weekly dose groups. \n \nBased on the current characterization of PK, RoActemra trough concentration at steady state are 50% \nhigher in this population relative to average concentrations in a large dataset from the RA population. \nThese differences occur due to unknown reasons. PK differences are not accompanied by marked \ndifferences in PD parameters and so the clinical relevance is unknown.    \n \nIn GCA patients, higher exposure was observed in patients with lower body weight. For the 162 mg \nevery week dosing regimen, the steady-state Cavg was 51% higher in patients with body weight less \nthan 60 kg compared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. For the 162 mg every other week \nregimen, the steady-state Cavg was 129% higher in patients with body weight less than 60 kg \ncompared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. There is limited data for patients above 100 kg \n(n=7). \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous dosing in GCA patients, the absorption t½ was around 4 days.  The \nbioavailability for the SC formulation was 0.8. The median values of Tmax were 3 days after the \nRoActemra  weekly dose and 4.5 days after the tocilizumab every other week dose.   \n \nDistribution \n \nIn GCA patients, the central volume of distribution was 4.09 L, the peripheral volume of distribution \nwas 3.37 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.46 L. \n \nElimination \n \nThe total clearance of RoActemra was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance \nand the nonlinear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population \npharmacokinetic analysis and was 6.7 mL/h in GCA patients, \n \nIn GCA patients, at steady state, the effective t ½ of RoActemra varied between 18.3 and 18.9 days for \n162 mg weekly regimen, and between 4.2 and 7.9 days for 162 mg every other weekly regimen. At \nhigh serum concentrations, when total clearance of RoActemra is dominated by linear clearance, an \neffective t ½ of approximately 32 days was derived from the population parameter estimates. \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment: No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nRoActemra has been conducted. Most of the patients in the RA and GCA studies population \npharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Mild renal impairment \n(estimated creatinine clearance based on Cockcroft-Gault formula) did not impact the \npharmacokinetics of RoActemra. \n \nApproximately one-third of the patients in the GCA study had moderate renal impairment at baseline \n(estimated creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min). No impact on RoActemra exposure was noted in \nthese patients. \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment: No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nRoActemra has been conducted.  \n \nAge, gender and ethnicity: Population pharmacokinetic analyses in RA and GCA patients, showed that \nage, gender and ethnic origin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of RoActemra.  \n \nResults of the population PK analysis for sJIA and pJIA patients confirmed that body size is the only \ncovariate which has an appreciable impact on the pharmacokinetics of RoActemra including \nelimination and absorption so that body-weight based dosing should be taken into consideration (see \nTables 8 and 9). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies were not performed because IgG1 monoclonal antibodies are not deemed to \nhave intrinsic carcinogenic potential.  \n \nAvailable non-clinical data demonstrated the effect of IL-6 on malignant progression and apoptosis \nresistance to various cancer types. This data does not suggest a relevant risk for cancer initiation and \nprogression under RoActemra treatment. Additionally, proliferative lesions were not observed in a \n6-month chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys or in IL-6 deficient mice.  \n \nAvailable non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under RoActemra treatment. Effects on \nendocrine active and reproductive system organs were not observed in a chronic cynomolgus monkey \ntoxicity study and reproductive performance was not affected in IL-6 deficient mice. RoActemra \nadministered to cynomolgus monkeys during early gestation, was observed to have no direct or \nindirect harmful effect on pregnancy or embryonal-foetal development. However, a slight increase in \nabortion/embryonal-foetal death was observed with high systemic exposure (> 100 x human exposure) \nin the 50 mg/kg/day high-dose group compared to placebo and other low-dose groups. Although IL-6 \ndoes not seem to be a critical cytokine for foetal growth or the immunological control of the \nmaternal/foetal interface, a relation of this finding to RoActemra cannot be excluded. \n \nTreatment with a murine analogue did not exert toxicity in juvenile mice. In particular, there was no \nimpairment of skeletal growth, immune function and sexual maturation. \n \nThe non-clinical safety profile of RoActemra in the cynomolgus monkey does not suggest a difference \nbetween intravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration. \n \n \n\n\n\n103 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n134 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nRoActemra 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \nTocilizumab \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nIn addition to this leaflet, you will be given a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety \ninformation that you need to be aware of before and during treatment with RoActemra. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What RoActemra is and what it is used for \n \nRoActemra contains the active substance tocilizumab, which is a protein made from specific immune \ncells (monoclonal antibody), that blocks the action of a specific protein (cytokine) called interleukin-6. \nThis protein is involved in inflammatory processes of the body, and blocking it can reduce the \ninflammation in your body. RoActemra helps to reduce symptoms such as pain and swelling in your \njoints and can also improve your performance of daily tasks. RoActemra has been shown to slow the \ndamage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve your ability to do \nnormal daily activities. \n\n \n• RoActemra is used to treat adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), \n\nan autoimmune disease, if previous therapies did not work well enough. RoActemra is usually \ngiven in combination with methotrexate. However, RoActemra can be given alone if your \ndoctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate. \n\n \n• RoActemra can also be used to treat adults who have not had previous methotrexate treatment \n\nif they have severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis. \n \n\n• RoActemra is used to treat children with sJIA. RoActemra is used for children aged 2 years \nand over who have active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), an inflammatory \ndisease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints as well as fever and rash. \nRoActemra is used to improve the symptoms of sJIA and can be given in combination with \nmethotrexate or alone. \n\n \n• RoActemra is used to treat children with pJIA. RoActemra is used for children aged 2 \n\nyears and over with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), an inflammatory \ndisease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints.

What you need to know before you are given RoActemra \n \nYou are not to be given RoActemra \n\n• if you are allergic  to tocilizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nSection 6). \n\n• if you have an active, severe infection. \nIf any of these applies to you, tell the doctor or nurse giving you the infusion. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given RoActemra. \n \n\n• If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or \nlight-headedness, swelling of the lips or skin rash during or after the infusion, then tell your \ndoctor immediately. \n\n \n• If you have any kind of infection, short- or long-term, or if you often get infections. Tell your \n\ndoctor immediately if you feel unwell. RoActemra can reduce your body’s ability to respond \nto infections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the chance of getting a new \ninfection. \n\n \n• If you have had tuberculosis, tell your doctor. Your doctor will check for signs and symptoms \n\nof tuberculosis before starting RoActemra. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, \nweight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell \nyour doctor immediately. \n\n \n• If you have had intestinal ulcers or diverticulitis, tell your doctor.

What RoActemra is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use RoActemra \n3. How to use RoActemra \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store RoActemra \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What RoActemra is and what it is used for \n \nRoActemra contains the active substance tocilizumab, which is a protein made from specific immune \ncells (monoclonal antibody), that blocks the action of a specific protein (cytokine) called interleukin-6. \nThis protein is involved in inflammatory processes of the body, and blocking it can reduce the \ninflammation in your body. RoActemra is used to treat: \n \n• adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, if \n\nprevious therapies did not work well enough.  \n \n• adults with severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who have not had \n\nprevious treatment with methotrexate. \n \nRoActemra helps to reduce RA symptoms such as pain and swelling in your joints, and can also \nimprove your performance of daily tasks. RoActemra has been shown to slow the damage to the \ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve your ability to do normal \ndaily activities. \n \nRoActemra is usually given in combination with another medicine for RA called methotrexate. \nHowever, RoActemra can be given alone if your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate. \n \n\n• adults with a disease of the arteries called giant cell arteritis (GCA), caused by \ninflammation of the body’s largest arteries, especially those that supply blood to the head and \nneck. Symptoms include headache, fatigue and jaw pain. Effects can include strokes and \nblindness.  \n \n\n\n\n144 \n\nRoActemra can reduce pain and swelling in the arteries and veins in your head, neck and arms.  \n \nGCA is often treated with medicines called steroids. They are usually effective, but can have \nside effects if used at high doses for a long time. Reducing the steroid dose can also lead to a \nflare-up of the GCA. Adding RoActemra to the treatment means that steroids can be used for a \nshorter time, while still controlling GCA. \n \n\n• children and adolescents, aged 1 year and over, with active systemic juvenile idiopathic \narthritis (sJIA), an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints as \nwell as fever and rash.  \n \nRoActemra is used to improve the symptoms of sJIA. It can be given in combination with \nmethotrexate or alone.   \n \n\n• children and adolescents, aged 2 years and over, with active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis (pJIA). This is an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one \nor more joints.  \n \nRoActemra is used to improve the symptoms of pJIA. It can be given in combination with \nmethotrexate or alone.  \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use RoActemra \n \nDo not use RoActemra \n• if you or a child patient you look after are allergic to tocilizumab or any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6). \n• if you or a child patient you look after have an active, severe infection. \n \nIf either of these applies to you, tell a doctor. Do not use RoActemra. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using RoActemra. \n \n• If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or light-\n\nheadedness, swelling of the lips, tongue, face or skin itching, hives or rash during or after the \ninjection, then tell your doctor immediately.  \n\n \n• Do not take the next dose until you have informed your doctor AND your doctor has told you to \n\ntake the next dose if you have experienced any allergic reaction symptoms after RoActemra \nadministration. \n\n• If you have any kind of infection, short- or long-term, or if you often get infections. Tell your \ndoctor immediately if you feel unwell. RoActemra can reduce your body’s ability to respond to \ninfections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the chance of getting a new \ninfection. \n\n \n• If you have had tuberculosis, tell your doctor. Your doctor will check for signs and symptoms \n\nof tuberculosis before starting RoActemra. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, \nweight loss, listlessness, mild fever) or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell \nyour doctor immediately. \n\n \n• If you have had intestinal ulcers or diverticulitis, tell your doctor. Symptoms would include \n\nabdominal pain and unexplained changes in bowel habits with a fever. \n \n\n\n\n145 \n\n• If you have liver disease, tell your doctor. Before you use RoActemra, your doctor may do a \nblood test to measure your liver function. \n\n \n• If any patient has recently been vaccinated, or is planning a vaccination, tell your doctor. All \n\npatients should be up-to-date with all their vaccinations before they start treatment with \nRoActemra. Certain types of vaccines should not be given while receiving RoActemra. \n\n \n• If you have cancer, tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given \n\nRoActemra. \n \n• If you have cardiovascular risk factors such as raised blood pressure and raised cholesterol \n\nlevels, tell your doctor. These factors need to be monitored while receiving RoActemra. \n \n• If you have moderate to severe kidney function problems, your doctor will monitor you. \n \n• If you have persistent headaches. \n \nYour doctor will perform a blood test before you receive RoActemra, to determine if you have a low \nwhite blood cell count, low platelet count or high liver enzymes. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nRoActemra subcutaneous injection is not recommended for use in children under 1 year of age. \nRoActemra must not be given to children with sJIA weighing less than 10 kg.  \n \nIf a child has a history of macrophage activation syndrome (activation and uncontrolled proliferation \nof specific blood cells), tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if they can still be given \nRoActemra. \n \nOther medicines and RoActemra \nTell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, or have recently taken any. RoActemra can \naffect the way some medicines work, and the dose of these may require adjustment. If you are using \nmedicines containing any of the following active substances, tell your doctor: \n• methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, used to reduce inflammation \n• simvastatin or atorvastatin, used to reduce cholesterol levels \n• calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine), used to treat raised blood pressure \n• theophylline, used to treat asthma \n• warfarin or phenprocoumon, used as a blood thinning agents \n• phenytoin, used to treat convulsions \n• ciclosporin, used to suppress your immune system during organ transplants \n• benzodiazepines (e.g. temazepam), used to relieve anxiety \n \nDue to lack of clinical experience, RoActemra is not recommended for use with other biological \nmedicines for the treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA or GCA. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nRoActemra is not to be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Talk to your doctor if you are \npregnant, may be pregnant, or intend to become pregnant.  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after \ntreatment. \n \nStop breast-feeding if you are to be given RoActemra, and talk to your doctor. Leave a gap of at \nleast 3 months after your last treatment before you start breast-feeding. It is not known whether \nRoActemra is passed into breast milk. \n \n\n\n\n146 \n\nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy, do not drive or use machines.  \n \n \n3. How to use RoActemra \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check \nwith your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nThe treatment will be prescribed and started by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA or GCA. \n \nThe recommended dose  \nThe dose for RA and GCA adults is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled syringe) given once a week. \n \nChildren and adolescents with sJIA (aged 1 year and over) \nThe usual dose of RoActemra depends on the patient’s weight.  \n• If the patient weighs less than 30 kg: the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled syringe) once \n\nevery 2 weeks  \n• If the patient weighs 30 kg or more: the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled syringe) once \n\nevery week \n \nChildren and adolescents with pJIA (aged 2 and over) \nThe usual dose of RoActemra depends on the patient’s weight. \n• If the patient weighs less than 30 kg: the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled syringe), once \n\nevery 3 weeks  \n• If the patient weighs 30 kg or more: the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled syringe), once \n\nevery 2 weeks. \n \nRoActemra is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). At the start, your doctor or nurse \nmay inject RoActemra. However, your doctor may decide that you may inject RoActemra yourself. In \nthis case you will get training on how to inject RoActemra yourself. Parents and carers will get \ntraining on how to inject RoActemra for patients who cannot inject themselves, such as children. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you have any questions about giving yourself or a child patient you look after an \ninjection. You will find detailed “Instructions for administration” at the end of this leaflet.  \n \nIf you use more RoActemra than you should \nBecause RoActemra is given in one pre-filled syringe, it is unlikely that you will receive too much. \nHowever, if you are worried, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \nIf an adult with RA or GCA or a child or adolescent with sJIA misses or forgets a dose \nIt is very important to use RoActemra exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Keep track of your next  \ndose.  \n• If you miss your weekly dose within 7 days, take your dose on the next scheduled day.  \n• If you miss your once every 2 weeks dose within 7 days, inject a dose as soon as you remember \n\nand take your next dose at your regular scheduled time.  \n• If you miss your dose by more than 7 days, or you are not sure when to inject RoActemra, call \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nIf a child or adolescent with pJIA misses or forgets a dose \nIt is very important to use RoActemra exactly as prescribed by the doctor. Keep track of the next \ndose.  \n• If a dose is missed within 7 days, inject a dose as soon as you remember and give the next dose \n\nat the regular scheduled time.  \n\n\n\n147 \n\n• If a dose is missed by more than 7 days, or you are not sure when to inject RoActemra, call the \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n\n \nIf you stop using RoActemra \nYou should not stop using RoActemra without discussing with your doctor first. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

These instructions do not replace training from your healthcare provider. \nYour healthcare provider should show you how to prepare and inject properly before you use the \nRoActemra syringe for the first time. Ask your healthcare provider any questions you may have. Do \nnot attempt to administer an injection until you are sure that you understand how to use the \nRoActemra syringe.  \n \nPlease also read the Patient Leaflet that comes with the RoActemra syringe for the most important \ninformation you need to know about the medicine. It is important to remain under your healthcare \nprovider's care while using RoActemra. \n \nImportant Information: \n \n\n• Do not use the syringe if it appears to be damaged \n• Do not use if medicine is cloudy, hazy, discolored or contains particles \n• Do not try to take apart the syringe at any time \n• Do not remove the needle-cap until you are ready to inject \n• Do not inject through clothing covering the skin \n• Never re-use the same syringe \n• Do not touch the syringe trigger fingers as this may damage the syringe \n\n \nStorage \n \nKeep the RoActemra syringe and all medicines out of the sight and reach of children. Always store the \nsyringe in a refrigerator at a temperature of 2°C - 8°C. Protect the syringe from freezing and from \nlight. Keep the pre-filled syringes in the outer carton to protect it from light and keep them dry. \n \nPre-filled Syringe parts \n\n \n \nYou will need the following to give your injection: \nIncluded in the box: \n\n• Pre-filled Syringe \n \n\nNot included in the box: \n• Alcohol pad \n• Sterile cotton ball or gauze \n• Puncture-resistant container or sharps container for safe disposal of needle-cap and used syringe \n \n\n\n\n153 \n\nA place to prepare your supplies:  \n• Find a well-lit, clean, flat surface such as a table \n\n \nStep 1. Visually check the syringe \n \n\n• Take the box containing the syringe out of the refrigerator and open the box. Do not touch the \ntrigger fingers on the syringe as this may damage the syringe. \n\n• Remove the syringe from the box and visually examine the syringe, as well as the medicine in \nthe syringe. This is important to ensure that the syringe and medicine are safe to use. \n\n• Check the expiration date on the box and syringe (See Fig. A) to make sure that it has not passed \n(expired). Do not use the syringe if the expiration date has passed. This is important to ensure \nthat the syringe and medicine are safe to use. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nDispose of the syringe and do not use if: \n• the medicine is cloudy \n• the medicine contains particles \n• the medicine is any color besides colorless to yellowish \n• any part of the syringe appears to be damaged \n \n\nStep 2. Allow the syringe to adjust to room temperature \n• Do not remove the needle-cap on your syringe until Step 5. Early removal of the needle-cap can \ncause the medication to dry out and block the needle. \n \n• Place the syringe on a clean flat surface and allow the syringe to come to room temperature \n\n(18°C – 28°C) for about 25-30 minutes to warm up. Not allowing the syringe to come to room \ntemperature could result in an uncomfortable injection and it may be difficult to depress the \nplunger. \n\n• Do not warm up the syringe in any other way. \n \nStep 3. Clean your hands \n \n\n• Wash your hands with soap and water. \n \n\nStep 4. Choose and prepare an injection site \n \n\n• The recommended injection sites are the front and middle of your thighs and the lower part of \nthe abdomen below the navel (belly button) except for the five centimeter area directly around \nthe navel. (See Fig. B) \n\n• If a caregiver is giving the injection, the outer area of the upper arms may also be used. (See Fig. \nB) \n\n \n\n\n\n154 \n\n \n \n\n• You should use a different place each time you give yourself an injection, at least three \ncentimeters from the area you used for your previous injection. \n\n• Do not inject into areas that could be bothered by a belt or waistband. Do not inject into moles, \nscars, bruises, or areas where the skin is tender, red, hard or not intact. \n\n• Clean the chosen injection site area using the alcohol pad (See Fig. C), to reduce the risk of \ninfection. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n• Let the skin dry for approximately 10 seconds. \n• Be sure not to touch the cleaned area prior to the injection. Do not fan or blow on the clean area. \n\n \nStep 5. Remove needle-cap \n \n\n• Do not hold the syringe by the plunger while removing the needle-cap. \n• Hold the needle-shield of the syringe firmly with one hand and pull off the needle-cap with the \n\nother hand. (See Fig. D) If you cannot remove the needle cap you should request the help of a \ncaregiver or contact your healthcare provider. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n155 \n\n• Do not touch the needle or let it touch any surface. \n• You may see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. \n• Throw away the needle-cap in the puncture resistant container or sharps container. \n \nNOTE: Once the needle-cap is removed, the syringe must be used immediately. \n \n•  If it is not used within 5 minutes of cap removal, the syringe must be disposed of in the \n\npuncture resistant container or sharps container and a new syringe must be used. If the needle \ncap is removed for more than 5 minutes, it may be more difficult to perform an injection as the \nmedicine can dry out and block the needle. \n\n \n• Never reattach the needle-cap after removal. \n\n \nStep 6. Give the injection \n \n\n• Hold the syringe comfortably in your hand. \n• To be sure the needle can be inserted correctly under the skin, pinch a fold of loose skin at the \n\nclean injection site with your free hand. Pinching the skin is important to ensure that you inject \nunder the skin (into fatty tissue) but not any deeper (into muscle). Injection into muscle could \nresult in an uncomfortable injection. \n\n• Do not hold or push on the plunger while inserting the needle into the skin. \n• Insert the needle all the way into the pinched skin at an angle between 45° to 90° with a quick, \n\nfirm action. (See Fig. E). \n \n\n \n \n\nIt is important to choose the correct angle to ensure the medication is delivered under the skin (into \nfatty tissue), otherwise the injection could be painful and the medication may not work. \n \n\n• Then keep the syringe in position and let go of the pinch of skin. \n• Slowly inject all of the medicine by gently pushing the plunger all the way down. (See Fig. F). \n\nYou must press the plunger all the way down to ensure that you get the full dose of medication \nand to ensure the trigger fingers are completely pushed to the side. If the plunger is not fully \ndepressed the needle shield will not extend to cover the needle when it is removed. If the needle \nis not covered proceed carefully, and place the syringe into the puncture resistant container to \navoid injury with the needle. \n\n \n\n\n\n156 \n\n \n• Once the plunger is pushed all the way down, keep pressing down on the plunger to be sure all \n\nof the medicine is injected before taking the needle out of the skin. \n• Keep pressing down on the plunger while you take the needle out of the skin at the same angle \n\nas inserted. (See Fig. G) \n• If following insertion of the needle, you cannot press down the plunger, you must dispose of the \n\npre-filled syringe in a puncture resistant container and use a new pre-filled syringe (starting \nagain at Step 2). If you still experience difficulty, you should consult your healthcare provider. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n• Once the needle is removed completely from the skin, you can release the plunger, allowing the \nneedle-shield to protect the needle. (See Fig. H) \n\n \n\n \n• If you see drops of blood at the injection site, you can press a sterile cotton ball or gauze over the \n\ninjection site for approximately 10 seconds. \n• Do not rub the injection site. \n\n \n\n\n\n157 \n\nStep 7. Dispose of the syringe \n \n\n• Do not try to re-cap your syringe. \n• Throw away used syringes in a puncture-resistant container or sharps container. Ask your \n\nhealthcare provider or pharmacist for information about where you can get a \"sharps\" container \nor what other types of puncture-resistant containers you can use to safely dispose of your used \nsyringes, if you do not have one. (See Fig. I) \n\n \n\n \n \n\nCheck with your healthcare provider for instructions about the right way to throw away used syringes. \nThere may be local or state laws about how to throw away used syringes. \n\n \nDo not throw away used syringes or the puncture resistant container in household trash and do not \nrecycle them.  \n \n\n• Dispose of the full container as instructed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist. \n• Always keep the puncture-resistant container out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \nPatient advice regarding hypersensitivity reactions (also known as anaphylaxis, if severe) \n \nIf you develop symptoms such as, but not limited to skin rash, itching, chills, swelling of face, lips, \ntongue or throat, chest pain, wheezing, difficulty breathing or swallowing or feeling dizzy or faint at \nany time while not at the clinic during or following an RoACTEMRA injection you should seek \nemergency care immediately. \n \nPatient advice regarding early recognition and treatment to limit risk of a serious infection  \n \nBe alert for the first signs of infection such as: \n \n• body aches, fever, chills \n• cough, chest discomfort/tightness, shortness of breath \n• redness, heat, unusual swelling of skin or joint \n• abdominal pain/tenderness and/or change in bowel function \n \nCall your doctor and seek medical attention without delay if you think you might be developing an \ninfection.  \n \nIf you have any concerns or questions about your syringe, contact your healthcare provider or \npharmacist for assistance. \n\n\n\n158 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nRoActemra 162 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen (ACTPen®) \nTocilizumab \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains  \nimportant information for you. \n \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it onto others. It may harm them \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nIn addition to this leaflet, you will be given a Patient Alert Card, which contains important safety \ninformation that you need to be aware of before and during treatment with RoActemra. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What RoActemra is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use RoActemra \n3. How to use RoActemra \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store RoActemra \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What RoActemra is and what it is used for \n \nRoActemra contains the active substance tocilizumab, which is a protein made from specific immune \ncells (monoclonal antibody), that blocks the action of a specific protein (cytokine) called interleukin-6. \nThis protein is involved in inflammatory processes of the body, and blocking it can reduce the \ninflammation in your body. RoActemra is used to treat: \n \n• adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, if \n\nprevious therapies did not work well enough.  \n \n\n• adults with severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who have not had \nprevious treatment with methotrexate..  \n\n \nRoActemra helps to reduce symptoms such as pain and swelling in your joints and can also \nimprove your performance of daily tasks. RoActemra has been shown to slow the damage to the \ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve your ability to do normal \ndaily activities. \n\n \nRoActemra is usually given in combination with another medicine for RA called methotrexate. \nHowever, RoActemra can be given alone if your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate. \n\n \n• adults with a disease of the arteries called giant cell arteritis (GCA), caused by inflammation \n\nof the body’s largest arteries, especially those that supply blood to the head and neck. Symptoms \ninclude headache, fatigue and jaw pain. Effects can include strokes and blindness.  \n\n \n\n\n\n159 \n\nRoActemra can reduce pain and swelling in the arteries and veins in your head, neck and arms.  \n \n\nGCA is often treated with medicines called steroids. They are usually effective, but can have side \neffects if used at high doses for a long time. Reducing the steroid dose can also lead to a flare-up \nof the GCA. Adding RoActemra to the treatment means that steroids can be used for a shorter \ntime, while still controlling GCA. \n\n \n• children and adolescents, aged 12 years and over, with active systemic juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis (sJIA), an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints as \nwell as fever and rash.  \n \nRoActemra is used to improve the symptoms of sJIA. It can be given in combination with \nmethotrexate or alone.   \n\n \n• children and adolescents, aged 12 years and over, with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis (pJIA). This is an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more \njoints.  \n\n \nRoActemra is used to improve the symptoms of pJIA. It can be given in combination with \nmethotrexate or alone.  \n \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you use RoActemra \n \nDo not use RoActemra \n• if you or a child patient you look after are allergic to tocilizumab or any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6). \n• if you or a child patient you look after have an active, severe infection. \n \nIf either of these applies to you, tell a doctor. Do not use RoActemra. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using RoActemra. \n \n• If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or light-\n\nheadedness, swelling of the lips, tongue, face or skin itching, hives or rash during or after the \ninjection, then tell your doctor immediately.  \n\n \n• Do not take the next dose until you have informed your doctor AND your doctor has told you to \n take the next dose if you have experienced any allergic reaction symptoms after RoActemra \n administration. \n \n• If you have any kind of infection, short- or long-term, or if you often get infections. Tell your \n\ndoctor immediately if you feel unwell. RoActemra can reduce your body’s ability to respond to \ninfections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the chance of getting a new \ninfection. \n\n \n• If you have had tuberculosis, tell your doctor. Your doctor will check for signs and \n symptoms of tuberculosis before starting RoActemra. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent \n cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever) or any other infection appear during or after therapy \n tell your doctor immediately. \n \n• If you have had intestinal ulcers or diverticulitis, tell your doctor. Symptoms would include \n\nabdominal pain and unexplained changes in bowel habits with a fever. \n \n\n\n\n160 \n\n• If you have liver disease, tell your doctor. Before you use RoActemra, your doctor may do a \nblood test to measure your liver function. \n\n \n• If any patient has recently been vaccinated, or is planning a vaccination, tell your doctor. All \n\npatients should be up-to-date with all their vaccinations before they start treatment with \nRoActemra. Certain types of vaccines should not be given while receiving RoActemra. \n\n \n• If you have cancer, tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given \n\nRoActemra. \n \n• If you have cardiovascular risk factors such as raised blood pressure and raised cholesterol \n\nlevels, tell your doctor. These factors need to be monitored while receiving RoActemra. \n \n• If you have moderate to severe kidney function problems, your doctor will monitor you. \n \n• If you have persistent headaches. \n \nYour doctor will perform a blood test before you receive RoActemra, to determine if you have a low \nwhite blood cell count, low platelet count or high liver enzymes. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nRoActemra pre-filled pen (ACTPen®) is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age. \nRoActemra must not be given to children with sJIA weighing less than 10 kg.  \n \nIf a child has a history of macrophage activation syndrome (activation and uncontrolled proliferation \nof specific blood cells), tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if they can still be given \nRoActemra. \n \nOther medicines and RoActemra \nTell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, or have recently taken any. RoActemra can \naffect the way some medicines work, and the dose of these may require adjustment. If you are using \nmedicines containing any of the following active substances, tell your doctor: \n• methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, used to reduce inflammation \n• simvastatin or atorvastatin, used to reduce cholesterol levels \n• calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine), used to treat raised blood pressure \n• theophylline, used to treat asthma \n• warfarin or phenprocoumon, used as a blood thinning agents \n• phenytoin, used to treat convulsions \n• ciclosporin, used to suppress your immune system during organ transplants \n• benzodiazepines (e.g. temazepam), used to relieve anxiety \n \nDue to lack of clinical experience, RoActemra is not recommended for use with other biological \nmedicines for the treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA, or GCA. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nRoActemra is not to be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Talk to your doctor if you are \npregnant, may be pregnant, or intend to become pregnant.  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after \ntreatment. \n \nStop breast-feeding if you are to be given RoActemra, and talk to your doctor. Leave a gap of at \nleast 3 months after your last treatment before you start breast-feeding. It is not known whether \nRoActemra is passed into breast milk. \n \n\n\n\n161 \n\nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy, do not drive or use machines.  \n \n \n3. How to use RoActemra \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check \nwith your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nThe treatment will be prescribed and started by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA or GCA. \n \nThe recommended dose  \nThe dose with RA or GCA for all adults is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled pen) given once a week. \n \nAdolescents with sJIA (aged 12 years and over) \nThe usual dose of RoActemra depends on the patient’s weight.  \n• If the patient weighs less than 30 kg: the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled pen) once \n\nevery 2 weeks  \n• If the patient weighs 30 kg or more: the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled pen) once every \n\nweek \n \nThe pre-filled pen should not be used to treat children less than 12 years of age. \n \nAdolescents with pJIA (aged 12 years and over) \nThe usual dose of RoActemra depends on the patient’s weight. \n• If the patient weighs less than 30 kg: the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled pen), once \n\nevery 3 weeks  \n• If the patient weighs 30 kg or more: the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled pen), once \n\nevery 2 weeks. \n \nThe pre-filled pen should not be used to treat children less than 12 years of age. \n \nRoActemra is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). At the start, your doctor or nurse \nmay inject RoActemra (ACTPen®). However, your doctor may decide that you may inject RoActemra \nyourself. In this case you will get training on how to inject RoActemra yourself.  Parents and carers \nwill get training on how to inject RoActemra for patients who cannot inject themselves. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you have any questions about giving yourself or an adolescent patient you look \nafter an injection. You will find detailed “Instructions for administration” at the end of this leaflet.  \n \nIf you use more RoActemra than you should \nBecause RoActemra is given in one pre-filled pen, it is unlikely that you will receive too much. \nHowever, if you are worried, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n \nIf an adult with RA or GCA or an adolescent with sJIA misses or forgets a dose \nIt is very important to use RoActemra exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Keep track of your next  \ndose.  \n\n• If you miss your weekly dose within 7 days, take your dose on the next scheduled day.  \n• If you miss your once every other week dose within 7 days, inject a dose as soon as you \n\nremember and take your next dose at your regular scheduled time.  \n• If you miss your weekly or once every other week dose by more than 7 days, or you are not \n\nsure when to inject RoActemra, call your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n\n\n162 \n\nIf an adolescent with pJIA misses or forgets a dose \nIt is very important to use RoActemra exactly as prescribed by the doctor. Keep track of the next \ndose.  \n• If a dose is missed within 7 days, inject a dose as soon as you remember and give the next dose \n\nat the regular scheduled time.  \n• If a dose is missed by more than 7 days, or you are not sure when to inject RoActemra, call the \n\ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you stop using RoActemra \nYou should not stop using RoActemra without discussing with your doctor first. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Before you use the RoACTEMRA pre-filled \npen for the first time, make sure your healthcare provider shows you the right way to use it. \n\nImportant:  Keep your unused pre-filled pens in the original carton and keep in the refrigerator at 2˚C \nto 8˚C (36˚F to 46˚F).  Do not freeze. \n\n• Do not remove the pre-filled pen cap until you are ready to inject RoACTEMRA. \n\n• Do not try to take apart the pre-filled pen at any time. \n\n• Do not reuse the same pre-filled pen.  \n\n• Do not use the pre-filled pen through clothing.   \n\n• Do not leave the pre-filled pen unattended.  \n\n• Keep out of the reach of children. \n\nParts of your RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen (See Figure A). \n\n   \n\n \nFigure A \n\n\n\n168 \n\n \nSupplies needed for an injection using your RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen (See Figure B): \n\n• 1 RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen \n• 1 Alcohol pad \n• 1 Sterile cotton ball or gauze \n• 1 Puncture-resistant container or sharps container for safe disposal of pre-filled pen cap and \n\nused pre-filled pen (see Step 4 “Dispose of the pre-filled pen”) \n \n\n \nFigure B \n\n \nStep 1. Preparing for a RoACTEMRA Injection \nFind a comfortable space with a clean, flat, working surface. \n\n• Take the box containing the pre-filled pen out of the refrigerator. \n• If you are opening the box for the first time, check to make sure that it is properly sealed. Do \n\nnot use the pre-filled pen if the box looks like it has already been opened. \n• Check that the pre-filled pen box is not damaged. Do not use RoActemra pre-filled pen if the \n\nbox looks damaged.  \n• Check the expiration date on the pre-filled pen box. Do not use the pre-filled pen if the \n\nexpiration date has passed because it may not be safe to use.   \n• Open the box, and remove 1 single-use RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen from the box.  \n• Return any remaining pre-filled pens in the box to the refrigerator. \n• Check the expiration date on the RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen (See Figure A).  Do not \n\nuse it if the expiration date has passed because it may not be safe to use.  If the expiration date \nhas passed, safely dispose of the pre-filled pen in a sharps container and get a new one. \n\n• Check the pre-filled pen to make sure it is not damaged.  Do not use the pre-filled pen if it \nappears to be damaged or if you have accidentally dropped the pre-filled pen. \n\n• Place the pre-filled pen on a clean, flat surface and let the pre-filled pen warm up for 45 \nminutes to allow it to reach room temperature. If the pre-filled pen does not reach room \ntemperature, this could cause your injection to feel uncomfortable and it could take longer to \ninject. \n\n\n\n169 \n\n• Do not speed up the warming process in any way, such as using the microwave or placing \nthe pre-filled pen in warm water. \n\n• Do not leave the pre-filled pen to warm up in direct sunlight. \nDo not remove the green cap while allowing your RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen to reach \nroom temperature. \n• Hold your RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen with the green cap pointing down (See Figure C). \n\n \n\n \nFigure C  \n\n \n• Look in the clear Window area. Check the liquid in the RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen (See \n\nFigure C).  It should be clear and colorless to pale yellow.  Do not inject RoACTEMRA if the \nliquid is cloudy, discolored, or has lumps or particles in it because it may not be safe to use.  \nSafely dispose of the pre-filled pen in a sharps container and get a new one.    \n\n• Wash your hands well with soap and water. \n\nStep 2. Choose and Prepare an Injection Site \nChoose an Injection Site \n\n• The front of your thigh or your abdomen except for the 2-inch (5cm) area around your navel \nare the recommended injection sites (See Figure D). \n\n• The outer area of the upper arms may also be used only if the injection is being given by a \ncaregiver.  Do not attempt to use the upper arm area by yourself (See Figure D). \n\nRotate Injection Site   \n• Choose a different injection site for each new injection at least 1 inch (2.5cm) from the last \n\narea you injected. \n• Do not inject into moles, scars, bruises, or areas where the skin is tender, red, hard or not \n\nintact. \n \n\n\n\n170 \n\n \nFigure D \n\n \nPrepare the Injection Site \n\n• Wipe the injection site with an alcohol pad in a circular motion and let it air dry to reduce the \nchance of getting an infection. Do not touch the injection site again before giving the \ninjection.  \n\n• Do not fan or blow on the clean area. \nStep 3. Inject RoACTEMRA \n\n• Hold the RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen firmly with one hand. Twist and pull off the green \ncap with the other hand (See Figure E). The green cap contains a loose fitting metal tube.  \n\n• If you cannot remove the green cap you should ask a caregiver for help or contact your \nhealthcare provider.  \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure E \n\nImportant: Do not touch the needle shield which is located at the tip of the pre-filled pen \nbelow the Window area (see Figure A), to avoid accidental needle stick injury. \n\n• Throw away the green cap in a sharps container. \n• After you remove the green cap, the pre-filled pen is ready for use. If the pre-filled pen is not \n\nused within 3 minutes of the cap removal, the pre-filled pen should be disposed of in the \nsharps container and a new pre-filled pen should be used. \n\n• Never reattach the green cap after removal. \n\n\n\n171 \n\n• Hold the pre-filled pen comfortably in 1 hand by the upper part, so that you can see the \nWindow area of the pre-filled pen (See Figure F).   \n\n \n\n \nFigure F \n\n \n• Use your other hand to gently pinch the area of skin you cleaned, to prepare a firm injection \n\nsite (See Figure G). The pre-filled pen requires a firm injection site to properly activate. \n\n• Pinching the skin is important to make sure that you inject under the skin (into fatty tissue) but \nnot any deeper (into muscle).  Injection into muscle could cause the injection to feel \nuncomfortable. \n\n \n\n \nFigure G \n\n \n\n• Do not press the green activation button yet.  \n• Place the needle-shield of the pre-filled pen against your pinched skin at a 90° angle (See \n\nFigure H).  \n• It is important to use the correct angle to make sure the medicine is delivered under the skin \n\n(into fatty tissue), or the injection could be painful and the medicine may not work. \n \n\n\n\n172 \n\n \nFigure H \n\n \n• To use the pre-filled pen, you first have to unlock the green Activation button. \n• To unlock it, press the pre-filled pen firmly against your pinched skin until the needle-shield is  \ncompletely pushed in (See Figure I).  \n \n\n \nFigure I \n\n \n• Continue to keep the needle-shield pushed in.  \n• If you don’t keep the needle-shield completely pushed against the skin, the green Activation \n\nbutton will not work. \n• Continue to pinch the skin while you keep the pre-filled pen in place. \n\n• Press the green Activation button to start the injection. A “click” sound indicates the start of \nthe injection. Keep the green button pressed in and continue holding the pre-filled pen pressed \nfirmly against your skin (See Figure J). If you cannot start the injection you should ask for \nhelp from a caregiver or contact your healthcare provider. \n\n\n\n173 \n\n \nFigure J \n\n \n• The purple indicator will move along the Window area during the injection  \n\n(See Figure K). \n• Watch the purple indicator until it stops moving to be sure the full dose of medication is \n\ninjected. \n\n  \nFigure K \n\n \n• The injection may take up to 10 seconds. \n• You may hear a second “click” during the injection but you should continue to hold the pre-\n\nfilled pen firmly against your skin until the purple indicator stops moving.  \n• When the purple indicator has stopped moving, release the green button. Lift the pre-filled pen \n\nstraight off of the injection site at a 90° angle to remove the needle from the skin.  The needle-\nshield will then move out and lock into place covering the needle (See Figure L). \n\n \nFigure L \n\n \n\n\n\n174 \n\n• Check the Window area to see that it is filled with the purple indicator (See Figure L). \n• If the Window area is not filled by the purple indicator then: \n\n• The needle-shield may not have locked. Do not touch the needle-shield of the pre-\nfilled pen, because you may stick yourself with the needle. If the needle is not \ncovered, carefully place the pre-filled pen into the sharps container to avoid any injury \nwith the needle. \n\n• You may not have received your full dose of RoACTEMRA. Do not try to re-use the \npre-filled pen. Do not repeat the injection with another pre-filled pen. Call your \nhealthcare provider for help. \n\nAfter the Injection \n• There may be a little bleeding at the injection site.  You can press a cotton ball or gauze over \n\nthe injection site.  \n• Do not rub the injection site. \n• If needed, you may cover the injection site with a small bandage. \n\nStep 4.  Dispose of the pre-filled pen \n• The RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen should not be reused. \n• Put the used pre-filled pen into your sharps container (see “How do I dispose of used pre-filled \n\npens?”) \n• Do not put the cap back on the pre-filled pen. \n• If your injection is given by another person, this person must also be careful when \n\nremoving the pre-filled pen and disposing of it to prevent accidental needle stick injury \nand passing infection. \n\nHow do I dispose of used pre-filled pens? \n• Put your used RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen and green cap in a sharps disposal container right \n\naway after use (See Figure M).    \n• Do not throw away (dispose of) the pre-filled pen and the green cap in your household \n\ntrash and do not recycle them. \n \n\n \nFigure M \n\n \n• Dispose of the full container as instructed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist. \n• Always keep the puncture-resistant container out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\n\n\n175 \n\nKeep the RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen and disposal container out of the reach of children. \nRecord your Injection \n\n• Write the date, time, and specific part of your body where you injected yourself.  It may also \nbe helpful to write any questions or concerns about the injection so you can ask your \nhealthcare provider. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about your RoACTEMRA pre-filled pen, talk to your \nhealthcare provider familiar with RoACTEMRA. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
