NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRemovab 10 micrograms concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne pre-filled syringe contains 10 micrograms of catumaxomab* in 0.1 ml solution, corresponding to \n0.1 mg/ml. \n \n*rat-mouse hybrid IgG2 monoclonal antibody produced in a rat-mouse hybrid-hybridoma cell line \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRemovab is indicated for the intraperitoneal treatment of malignant ascites in adults with \nEpCAM-positive carcinomas where standard therapy is not available or no longer feasible. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRemovab must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \nanti-neoplastic medicinal products. \n \nPosology \nPrior to the intraperitoneal infusion, pre-medication with analgesic / antipyretic / non-steroidal \nantiphlogistic medicinal products is recommended (see section 4.4). \nRemovab dosing schedule comprises the following four intraperitoneal infusions: \n1st dose  10 micrograms on day 0 \n2nd dose  20 micrograms on day 3 \n3rd dose  50 micrograms on day 7 \n4th dose  150 micrograms on day 10 \n \nRemovab has to be administered as constant rate intraperitoneal infusion with an infusion time of at \nleast 3 hours. In clinical studies infusion times of 3 hours and 6 hours were investigated. For the first \nof the four doses an infusion time of 6 hours may be considered depending on the patient’s health \ncondition.  \nAn interval of at least two infusion free calendar days must elapse between infusion days. The interval \nbetween the infusion days can be prolonged in case of relevant adverse reactions. The overall \ntreatment period should not exceed 20 days. \n \nMonitoring \nAdequate monitoring of the patient after end of Removab infusion is recommended. In the pivotal \nstudy patients were monitored for 24 h after each infusion. \n \nSpecial populations  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nHepatic impairment \nPatients with hepatic impairment of a higher severity grade than moderate and / or with more than \n70% of the liver metastasised and / or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction have not been investigated. \nTreatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of \nbenefit / risk (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nPatients with renal impairment of a higher severity grade than mild have not been investigated. \nTreatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of \nbenefit / risk (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Removab in the paediatric population in the granted indication. \n \nMethod of administration \nRemovab must be administered as an intraperitoneal infusion only. \nRemovab must not be administered by intraperitoneal bolus or by any other route of administration. \nFor information on the perfusion system to be used see section 4.4. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before administering the medicinal product \nBefore administration of Removab the concentrate for solution for infusion is diluted in sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. The diluted Removab solution for infusion is \nadministered intraperitoneally as constant rate infusion using an adequate pump system. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to murine (rat and / or mouse) proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRemovab must not be administered as a bolus or by any route other than intraperitoneally. \n \nCytokine release related symptoms \nAs release of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines is initiated by the binding of catumaxomab to \nimmune and tumour cells, cytokine release related clinical symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting \nand chills have been very commonly reported during and after the Removab administration (see \nsection 4.8). Dyspnoea and hypo-/ hypertension are commonly observed. In the clinical studies in \npatients with malignant ascites, 1,000 mg paracetamol intravenously was routinely administered prior \nto Removab infusion for pain and pyrexia control. Despite this premedication, patients experienced \nthe adverse reactions described above with an intensity of up to grade 3, according to the Common \nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the US National Cancer Institute, version 3.0. \nOther or additional standard pre-medication with analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic \nmedicinal products is recommended. \n \nSystemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which may also occur commonly due to the \nmechanism of action of catumaxomab, develops, in general, within 24 hours after Removab infusion, \nshowing symptoms of fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea and leucocytosis (see section 4.8). Standard \ntherapy or premedication, e.g. analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic is appropriate to \nlimit the risk. \n \nAbdominal pain \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nAbdominal pain was commonly reported as an adverse reaction. This transient effect is considered \npartially a consequence of the intraperitoneal route of administration. \n \nPerformance status and BMI \nA solid performance status expressed as Body Mass Index (BMI) > 17 (to be assessed after drainage \nof ascites fluid) and Karnofsky Index > 60 is required prior to Removab therapy. \n \nAcute infections \nIn presence of factors interfering with the immune system, in particular acute infections, the \nadministration of Removab is not recommended. \n \nAscites drainage \nAppropriate medical management of ascites drainage is a prerequisite for Removab treatment in order \nto assure stable circulatory and renal functions. This must at least include ascites drainage until stop \nof spontaneous flow or symptom relief, and, if appropriate, supportive replacement therapy with \ncrystalloids and / or colloids.  \n \nPatients with hemodynamic insufficiency, oedema or hypoproteinaemia \nBlood volume, blood protein, blood pressure, pulse and renal function should be assessed before each \nRemovab infusion. Conditions such as hypovolaemia, hypoproteinaemia, hypotension, \ncirculatory decompensation and acute renal impairment must be resolved prior to each \nRemovab infusion. \n \nHepatic impairment or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction \nPatients with hepatic impairment of a higher severity grade than moderate and / or with more than \n70% of the liver metastasised and / or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction have not been investigated. \nTreatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of \nbenefit / risk. \n \nRenal impairment \nPatients with renal impairment of a higher severity grade than mild have not been investigated. \nTreatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of \nbenefit / risk. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of catumaxomab in pregnant women.  \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \nRemovab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether catumaxomab/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue / abstain from Removab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nNo data on the effect of catumaxomab on fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nRemovab has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients experiencing infusion-related symptoms should be advised not to drive and use machines \nuntil symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nAdverse reactions are derived from an integrated safety analysis including 12 clinical studies. 728 \npatients received catumaxomab intraperitoneally, 293 patients as 6 hour - and 435 patients as 3 hour \ninfusions. \nThe overall safety profile of Removab is characterised by cytokine-release related symptoms and \ngastrointestinal reactions. \nCytokine-release related reactions: SIRS a potentially life-threatening combination of tachycardia, \nfever and/or dyspnoea, can develop within 24 hours after a catumaxomab infusion and resolves under \nsymptomatic treatment. Other cytokine-release related reactions such as fever, chills, nausea, and \nvomiting are very commonly reported reactions in intensity of CTCAE grade 1 and 2 (US National \nCancer Institute, version 4.0). These symptoms reflect the mechanism of action of catumaxomab and \nare in general fully reversible.  \nGastrointestinal reactions like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are very common and \noccur mostly with CTCAE grade 1 or 2, but were also observed in higher grades, and respond to \nadequate symptomatic treatment. \nThe safety profile of catumaxomab using a 3h versus a 6h infusion time is in general comparable in \nregards to nature, frequency and severity.  An increased frequency of some adverse reactions was seen \nin relation to 3h administration including chills and hypotension (grades 1 / 2), diarrhoea (all grades) \nand fatigue (grade 1 / 2). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn Table 1, adverse reactions are listed by organ class. Frequency groupings are defined as follows: \nvery common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100). \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported from patients receiving catumaxomab treatment \nInfections and infestations \nCommon Infection. \nUncommon Erythaema induratum*, device-related infection*. \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon Anaemia*, lymphopenia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia. \nUncommon Thrombocytopenia*, coagulopathy*. \nImmune system disorders \nCommon Cytokine release syndrome*, hypersensitivity*. \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon Decreased appetite* / anorexia, dehydration*, hypokalaemia, \n\nhypoalbuminaemia, hyponatraemia*, hypocalcaemia*, hypoproteinaemia. \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon Anxiety, insomnia. \nNervous system disorders \nCommon Headache, dizziness. \nUncommon Convulsion*. \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon Vertigo. \nCardiac disorders \nCommon Tachycardia*, incl. sinus tachycardia. \nVascular disorders \nCommon Hypotension*, hypertension*, flushing. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon Dyspnoea*, pleural effusion*, cough. \nUncommon Pulmonary embolism*, hypoxia*. \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common Abdominal pain*, nausea*, vomiting*, diarrhoea*. \nCommon Constipation*, dyspepsia, abdominal distension, sub-ileus*, flatulence, \n\ngastric disorder, ileus*, gastroesophageal reflux disease, dry mouth. \nUncommon Gastrointestinal haemorrhage*, intestinal obstruction*.  \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon Cholangitis*, hyperbilirubinaemia. \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon Rash*, erythaema*, hyperhidrosis, pruritus. \nUncommon Skin reaction*, dermatitis allergic*. \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon Back pain, myalgia, arthralgia. \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon Proteinuria. \nUncommon Renal failure acute*. \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common Pyrexia*, fatigue*, chills*. \nCommon Pain, asthenia*, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome*, oedema \n\nincl. oedema peripheral*, general physical health deterioration*, chest \npain, influenza-like illness, malaise*, catheter site erythema. \n\nUncommon Extravasation*, application site inflammation*. \n* were also reported as serious adverse reactions \nunderlined: see section ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nThe following definitions of CTCAE criteria of the US National Cancer Institute (version 4.0) apply: \nCTCAE grade 1 = mild, CTCAE grade 2 = moderate, CTCAE grade 3 = severe, CTCAE grade 4 = \nlife-threatening  \n \nCytokine release related symptoms with higher intensities \nIn 5.1% of patients pyrexia reached an intensity of CTCAE grade 3 as it was the case with cytokine \nrelease syndrome (1.0%), chills (0.8%), nausea (3.4%), vomiting (4.4%), dyspnoea (1.6%) and hypo-\n/hypertension (2.1% / 0.8%). In one patient (0.1%) dyspnoea and in 3 patients (0.4%) hypotension \nwas reported in CTCAE grade 4 intensity.  Symptoms of pain and pyrexia can be ameliorated or \navoided by pre-medication (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nSystemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) \nIn 3.8% of the patients symptoms of SIRS were observed within 24 hours after catumaxomab \ninfusion. In three patients (0.4%) an intensity of CTCAE grade 4 was observed. These reactions \nresolved under symptomatic treatment. \n \nAbdominal pain \nIn 43.7% of patients abdominal pain was reported as an adverse reaction reaching grade 3 in 8.2 % of \npatients, but it resolved under symptomatic treatment. \n \nHepatic enzymes \nTransient increase in hepatic enzymes was commonly observed after the administration of Removab. \nIn general, the changes in laboratory parameters were not clinically relevant and mostly returned to \nbaseline after end of treatment. \nOnly in case of clinically relevant or persisting increase further diagnostics or therapy should be \nconsidered.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. Patients receiving a higher than recommended dose of \ncatumaxomab experienced more severe (grade 3) adverse reactions. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC09 \n \nMechanism of action \nCatumaxomab is a trifunctional rat-mouse hybrid monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed \nagainst the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the CD3 antigen. \nThe EpCAM antigen is overexpressed on most carcinomas (Table 2). CD3 is expressed on mature \nT-cells as a component of the T-cell receptor. A third functional binding site in the Fc-region of \ncatumaxomab enables interaction with accessory immune cells via Fcγ receptors. \nDue to catumaxomab’s binding properties, tumour cells, T-cells and accessory immune cells come in \nclose proximity. Thereby, a concerted immunoreaction against tumour cells is induced which includes \ndifferent mechanisms of action such as T-cell activation, antibody-dependent cell-mediated \ncytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and phagocytosis. This results in \ndestruction of tumour cells. \n \nTable 2 EpCAM expression in most relevant ascites causing cancer types \n\n Literature data  \n \n\nRetrospective data from \nstudy \n\nIP-CAT-AC-03  \nCancer Type Percentage of tumors \n\nexpressing EpCAM \nPercentage of EpCAM \n\npositive effusions \nPercentage of EpCAM \n\npositive effusions  \nOvarian 90-92 79-100 98 \nGastric 96 75-100 100 \nColon 100 87-100 100 \nPancreatic 98 83-100 80 \nBreast 45*-81 71-100 86 \nEndometrial 94 100 100 \n*= lobular breast cancer  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe anti-tumour activity of catumaxomab has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.

This study compared paracentesis plus catumaxomab versus paracentesis \nalone (control). \n \nCatumaxomab was applied in patients where standard therapy was not available or no longer feasible \nand who had a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60. Catumaxomab was administered as four \nintraperitoneal infusions with increased doses of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms on day 0, 3, 7 and 10, \nrespectively (see section 4.2). In the pivotal study IP-REM-AC-01 98.1% of patients were hospitalised \nfor a median of 11 days. \n \nIn this study, the primary efficacy endpoint was puncture-free survival, which was a composite \nendpoint defined as the time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture or death, whichever \noccurred first. The results for puncture-free survival and time to first need for therapeutic ascites \npuncture in terms of medians and hazard ratios are presented in Table 3.

The geometric mean plasma Cmax was approximately 0.5 \nng/ml (range 0 to 2.3), and the geometric mean plasma AUC was approximately 1.7 day* ng/ml \n(range < LLOQ (lower limit of quantification) to 13.5). The geometric mean apparent terminal plasma \nelimination half-life (t1/2) was approximately 2.5 days (range 0.7 to 17). \n \nCatumaxomab was detectable in the ascites fluid and in plasma. The concentrations increased with the \nnumber of infusions and the doses applied in most patients. Plasma levels tended to decline after \nachieving a maximum after each dose. \n \nSpecial populations \nNo studies have been conducted. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of catumaxomab in animal models did not result in any signs of abnormal or \ndrug-related acute toxicity or signs of local intolerance at the injection/infusion site. However, these \nfindings are of limited value due to the high species-specificity of catumaxomab. \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity \nstudies have not been performed. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRemovab is indicated for the intraperitoneal treatment of malignant ascites in adults with \nEpCAM-positive carcinomas where standard therapy is not available or no longer feasible. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRemovab must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \nanti-neoplastic medicinal products. \n \nPosology \nPrior to the intraperitoneal infusion, pre-medication with analgesic / antipyretic / non-steroidal \nantiphlogistic medicinal products is recommended (see section 4.4). \nRemovab dosing schedule comprises the following four intraperitoneal infusions: \n1st dose  10 micrograms on day 0 \n2nd dose  20 micrograms on day 3 \n3rd dose  50 micrograms on day 7 \n4th dose  150 micrograms on day 10 \n \nRemovab has to be administered as constant rate intraperitoneal infusion with an infusion time of at \nleast 3 hours. In clinical studies infusion times of 3 hours and 6 hours were investigated. For the first \nof the four doses an infusion time of 6 hours may be considered depending on the patient’s health \ncondition.  \nAn interval of at least two infusion free calendar days must elapse between infusion days. The interval \nbetween the infusion days can be prolonged in case of relevant adverse reactions. The overall \ntreatment period should not exceed 20 days. \n \nMonitoring \nAdequate monitoring of the patient after end of Removab infusion is recommended. In the pivotal \nstudy patients were monitored for 24 h after each infusion. \n \nSpecial populations  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nHepatic impairment \nPatients with hepatic impairment of a higher severity grade than moderate and / or with more than \n70% of the liver metastasised and / or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction have not been investigated. \nTreatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of \nbenefit / risk (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nPatients with renal impairment of a higher severity grade than mild have not been investigated. \nTreatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of \nbenefit / risk (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Removab in the paediatric population in the granted indication. \n \nMethod of administration \nRemovab must be administered as an intraperitoneal infusion only. \nRemovab must not be administered by intraperitoneal bolus or by any other route of administration. \nFor information on the perfusion system to be used see section 4.4. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before administering the medicinal product \nBefore administration of Removab the concentrate for solution for infusion is diluted in sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. The diluted Removab solution for infusion is \nadministered intraperitoneally as constant rate infusion using an adequate pump system. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to murine (rat and / or mouse) proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRemovab must not be administered as a bolus or by any route other than intraperitoneally. \n \nCytokine release related symptoms \nAs release of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines is initiated by the binding of catumaxomab to \nimmune and tumour cells, cytokine release related clinical symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting \nand chills have been very commonly reported during and after the Removab administration (see \nsection 4.8). Dyspnoea and hypo-/ hypertension are commonly observed. In the clinical studies in \npatients with malignant ascites, 1,000 mg paracetamol intravenously was routinely administered prior \nto Removab infusion for pain and pyrexia control. Despite this premedication, patients experienced \nthe adverse reactions described above with an intensity of up to grade 3, according to the Common \nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the US National Cancer Institute, version 3.0. \nOther or additional standard pre-medication with analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic \nmedicinal products is recommended. \n \nSystemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which may also occur commonly due to the \nmechanism of action of catumaxomab, develops, in general, within 24 hours after Removab infusion, \nshowing symptoms of fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea and leucocytosis (see section 4.8). Standard \ntherapy or premedication, e.g. analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic is appropriate to \nlimit the risk. \n \nAbdominal pain \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nAbdominal pain was commonly reported as an adverse reaction. This transient effect is considered \npartially a consequence of the intraperitoneal route of administration. \n \nPerformance status and BMI \nA solid performance status expressed as Body Mass Index (BMI) > 17 (to be assessed after drainage \nof ascites fluid) and Karnofsky Index > 60 is required prior to Removab therapy. \n \nAcute infections \nIn presence of factors interfering with the immune system, in particular acute infections, the \nadministration of Removab is not recommended. \n \nAscites drainage \nAppropriate medical management of ascites drainage is a prerequisite for Removab treatment in order \nto assure stable circulatory and renal functions. This must at least include ascites drainage until stop \nof spontaneous flow or symptom relief, and, if appropriate, supportive replacement therapy with \ncrystalloids and / or colloids.  \n \nPatients with hemodynamic insufficiency, oedema or hypoproteinaemia \nBlood volume, blood protein, blood pressure, pulse and renal function should be assessed before each \nRemovab infusion. Conditions such as hypovolaemia, hypoproteinaemia, hypotension, \ncirculatory decompensation and acute renal impairment must be resolved prior to each \nRemovab infusion. \n \nHepatic impairment or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction \nPatients with hepatic impairment of a higher severity grade than moderate and / or with more than \n70% of the liver metastasised and / or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction have not been investigated. \nTreatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of \nbenefit / risk. \n \nRenal impairment \nPatients with renal impairment of a higher severity grade than mild have not been investigated. \nTreatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of \nbenefit / risk. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of catumaxomab in pregnant women.  \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \nRemovab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether catumaxomab/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue / abstain from Removab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nNo data on the effect of catumaxomab on fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nRemovab has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients experiencing infusion-related symptoms should be advised not to drive and use machines \nuntil symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nAdverse reactions are derived from an integrated safety analysis including 12 clinical studies. 728 \npatients received catumaxomab intraperitoneally, 293 patients as 6 hour - and 435 patients as 3 hour \ninfusions. \nThe overall safety profile of Removab is characterised by cytokine-release related symptoms and \ngastrointestinal reactions. \nCytokine-release related reactions: SIRS a potentially life-threatening combination of tachycardia, \nfever and/or dyspnoea, can develop within 24 hours after a catumaxomab infusion and resolves under \nsymptomatic treatment. Other cytokine-release related reactions such as fever, chills, nausea, and \nvomiting are very commonly reported reactions in intensity of CTCAE grade 1 and 2 (US National \nCancer Institute, version 4.0). These symptoms reflect the mechanism of action of catumaxomab and \nare in general fully reversible.  \nGastrointestinal reactions like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are very common and \noccur mostly with CTCAE grade 1 or 2, but were also observed in higher grades, and respond to \nadequate symptomatic treatment. \nThe safety profile of catumaxomab using a 3h versus a 6h infusion time is in general comparable in \nregards to nature, frequency and severity.  An increased frequency of some adverse reactions was seen \nin relation to 3h administration including chills and hypotension (grades 1 / 2), diarrhoea (all grades) \nand fatigue (grade 1 / 2). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn Table 1, adverse reactions are listed by organ class. Frequency groupings are defined as follows: \nvery common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100). \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported from patients receiving catumaxomab treatment \nInfections and infestations \nCommon Infection. \nUncommon Erythaema induratum*, device-related infection*. \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon Anaemia*, lymphopenia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia. \nUncommon Thrombocytopenia*, coagulopathy*. \nImmune system disorders \nCommon Cytokine release syndrome*, hypersensitivity*. \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon Decreased appetite* / anorexia, dehydration*, hypokalaemia, \n\nhypoalbuminaemia, hyponatraemia*, hypocalcaemia*, hypoproteinaemia. \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon Anxiety, insomnia. \nNervous system disorders \nCommon Headache, dizziness. \nUncommon Convulsion*. \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon Vertigo. \nCardiac disorders \nCommon Tachycardia*, incl. sinus tachycardia. \nVascular disorders \nCommon Hypotension*, hypertension*, flushing. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon Dyspnoea*, pleural effusion*, cough. \nUncommon Pulmonary embolism*, hypoxia*. \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common Abdominal pain*, nausea*, vomiting*, diarrhoea*. \nCommon Constipation*, dyspepsia, abdominal distension, sub-ileus*, flatulence, \n\ngastric disorder, ileus*, gastroesophageal reflux disease, dry mouth. \nUncommon Gastrointestinal haemorrhage*, intestinal obstruction*.  \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon Cholangitis*, hyperbilirubinaemia. \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon Rash*, erythaema*, hyperhidrosis, pruritus. \nUncommon Skin reaction*, dermatitis allergic*. \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon Back pain, myalgia, arthralgia. \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon Proteinuria. \nUncommon Renal failure acute*. \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common Pyrexia*, fatigue*, chills*. \nCommon Pain, asthenia*, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome*, oedema \n\nincl. oedema peripheral*, general physical health deterioration*, chest \npain, influenza-like illness, malaise*, catheter site erythema. \n\nUncommon Extravasation*, application site inflammation*. \n* were also reported as serious adverse reactions \nunderlined: see section ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nThe following definitions of CTCAE criteria of the US National Cancer Institute (version 4.0) apply: \nCTCAE grade 1 = mild, CTCAE grade 2 = moderate, CTCAE grade 3 = severe, CTCAE grade 4 = \nlife-threatening  \n \nCytokine release related symptoms with higher intensities \nIn 5.1% of patients pyrexia reached an intensity of CTCAE grade 3 as it was the case with cytokine \nrelease syndrome (1.0%), chills (0.8%), nausea (3.4%), vomiting (4.4%), dyspnoea (1.6%) and hypo-\n/hypertension (2.1% / 0.8%). In one patient (0.1%) dyspnoea and in 3 patients (0.4%) hypotension \nwas reported in CTCAE grade 4 intensity.  Symptoms of pain and pyrexia can be ameliorated or \navoided by pre-medication (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nSystemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) \nIn 3.8% of the patients symptoms of SIRS were observed within 24 hours after catumaxomab \ninfusion. In three patients (0.4%) an intensity of CTCAE grade 4 was observed. These reactions \nresolved under symptomatic treatment. \n \nAbdominal pain \nIn 43.7% of patients abdominal pain was reported as an adverse reaction reaching grade 3 in 8.2 % of \npatients, but it resolved under symptomatic treatment. \n \nHepatic enzymes \nTransient increase in hepatic enzymes was commonly observed after the administration of Removab. \nIn general, the changes in laboratory parameters were not clinically relevant and mostly returned to \nbaseline after end of treatment. \nOnly in case of clinically relevant or persisting increase further diagnostics or therapy should be \nconsidered.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. Patients receiving a higher than recommended dose of \ncatumaxomab experienced more severe (grade 3) adverse reactions. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC09 \n \nMechanism of action \nCatumaxomab is a trifunctional rat-mouse hybrid monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed \nagainst the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the CD3 antigen. \nThe EpCAM antigen is overexpressed on most carcinomas (Table 2). CD3 is expressed on mature \nT-cells as a component of the T-cell receptor. A third functional binding site in the Fc-region of \ncatumaxomab enables interaction with accessory immune cells via Fcγ receptors. \nDue to catumaxomab’s binding properties, tumour cells, T-cells and accessory immune cells come in \nclose proximity. Thereby, a concerted immunoreaction against tumour cells is induced which includes \ndifferent mechanisms of action such as T-cell activation, antibody-dependent cell-mediated \ncytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and phagocytosis. This results in \ndestruction of tumour cells. \n \nTable 2 EpCAM expression in most relevant ascites causing cancer types \n\n Literature data  \n \n\nRetrospective data from \nstudy \n\nIP-CAT-AC-03  \nCancer Type Percentage of tumors \n\nexpressing EpCAM \nPercentage of EpCAM \n\npositive effusions \nPercentage of EpCAM \n\npositive effusions  \nOvarian 90-92 79-100 98 \nGastric 96 75-100 100 \nColon 100 87-100 100 \nPancreatic 98 83-100 80 \nBreast 45*-81 71-100 86 \nEndometrial 94 100 100 \n*= lobular breast cancer  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe anti-tumour activity of catumaxomab has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Effective \ncatumaxomab-mediated killing of tumour cells in vitro was observed for target cells with low and \nhigh expression of the EpCAM antigen, independent of the primary tumour type. The in vivo \nanti-tumour activity of catumaxomab was confirmed in an immunologically compromised mouse \nmodel of ovarian carcinoma, where tumour development was delayed by an intraperitoneal treatment \nwith catumaxomab and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe efficacy of catumaxomab was demonstrated in two phase III clinical studies. Patients of non-\nCaucasian origin have not been included in these clinical studies. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n22 \n\n \nIP-REM-AC-01 \nA pivotal, two-arm, randomised, open-label, phase II/III clinical trial in 258 patients with symptomatic \nmalignant ascites due to EpCAM-positive carcinomas of whom 170 were randomised to \ncatumaxomab treatment. This study compared paracentesis plus catumaxomab versus paracentesis \nalone (control). \n \nCatumaxomab was applied in patients where standard therapy was not available or no longer feasible \nand who had a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60. Catumaxomab was administered as four \nintraperitoneal infusions with increased doses of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms on day 0, 3, 7 and 10, \nrespectively (see section 4.2). In the pivotal study IP-REM-AC-01 98.1% of patients were hospitalised \nfor a median of 11 days. \n \nIn this study, the primary efficacy endpoint was puncture-free survival, which was a composite \nendpoint defined as the time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture or death, whichever \noccurred first.

The geometric mean plasma Cmax was approximately 0.5 \nng/ml (range 0 to 2.3), and the geometric mean plasma AUC was approximately 1.7 day* ng/ml \n(range < LLOQ (lower limit of quantification) to 13.5). The geometric mean apparent terminal plasma \nelimination half-life (t1/2) was approximately 2.5 days (range 0.7 to 17). \n \nCatumaxomab was detectable in the ascites fluid and in plasma. The concentrations increased with the \nnumber of infusions and the doses applied in most patients. Plasma levels tended to decline after \nachieving a maximum after each dose. \n \nSpecial populations \nNo studies have been conducted. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of catumaxomab in animal models did not result in any signs of abnormal or \ndrug-related acute toxicity or signs of local intolerance at the injection/infusion site. However, these \nfindings are of limited value due to the high species-specificity of catumaxomab. \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity \nstudies have not been performed. \n \n \n6.

A perfusion tubing of an inner diameter of 1 mm and a length of \n150 cm must be used. \n\n• The perfusion tubing is connected to the Y-connection. \n• Parallel to each Removab application 250 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection are infused via an infusion valve / Y connection in the perfusion lead of the catheter. \n• The pump speed is adjusted according to the volume to be administered and the scheduled \n\ninfusion time. \n• When the 50 ml syringe containing the diluted Removab solution for infusion is empty it is \n\nreplaced with a 50 ml syringe containing 20 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninjection until the end of the scheduled infusion time to clear the dead volume in the perfusion \nlead (approximately 2 ml) under unchanged conditions. The remaining sodium chloride 9 \nmg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection can be discarded. \n\n• The catheter is kept closed until the next infusion. \n• The day after the last infusion a drainage of ascites until stop of spontaneous flow is performed. \n\nSubsequently, the catheter can be removed. \n \nFigure 3 Schematic illustration of the infusion system \n\n \n  \n\n1 250 ml Sodium Chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \n2 Removab solution for i.p. infusion \n3 Perfusion Tubing (1 mm inner diameter, 150 cm length) \n4 Infusion valve \n5 Perfusion Lead \n6 Catheter \n\n \n \n7.
