CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nDectova is indicated for the treatment of complicated and potentially life-threatening influenza A or B virus \n\ninfection in adult and paediatric patients (aged ≥6 months) when: \n\n \n\n• The patient’s influenza virus is known or suspected to be resistant to anti-influenza medicinal \nproducts other than zanamivir, and/or \n\n \n\n• Other anti-viral medicinal products for treatment of influenza, including inhaled zanamivir, are not \nsuitable for the individual patient. \n\n \n\nDectova should be used in accordance with official guidance. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nTreatment with Dectova should commence as soon as possible and usually within 6 days of the onset of \n\nsymptoms of influenza (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose is 600 mg twice daily for 5 to 10 days given by intravenous infusion. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nAdolescents, children and infants should receive a weight-based dose regimen for 5 to 10 days (Table 1). \n\n \n\nTable 1: Weight-based dose regimen by age for infants, children and adolescents with normal renal \n\nfunction \n\n \n\nAge range Weight-based dose regimen \n\n6 months to < 6 years 14 mg/kg twice daily \n\n 6 years to < 18 years  12 mg/kg twice daily up to a maximum dose of 600 mg \n\ntwice daily \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Dectova in children aged under 6 months have not been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nAdults and children (aged 6 years and over with a body weight of 50 kg or above) with creatinine clearance \n\n(CLcr) or clearance by continual renal replacement therapy (CLCRRT) < 80 mL/min should receive an initial \n\n600 mg dose followed by twice-daily maintenance dosing according to their renal function (Table 2). \n\n \n\nTable 2: Initial and maintenance dose regimens for adults and children (6 years and over with a body \n\nweight of 50 kg or above) with renal impairment \n\n \n\nCLcr or CLCRRT  \n(mL/min or \n\nmL/min/1.73m2)* \n\nInitial Dose Maintenance Dose Maintenance Dose Schedule \n\n50 to <80 600 mg 400 mg twice daily \nBegin maintenance dosing 12 \n\nhours after the initial dose \n30 to <50 600 mg 250 mg twice daily \n\n15 to <30 600 mg 150 mg twice daily \nBegin maintenance dosing 24 \n\nhours after the initial dose \n\n< 15 600 mg 60 mg twice daily \nBegin maintenance dosing 48 \n\nhours after the initial dose \n\n*CLcr or CLCRRT units in mL/min for adolescents 13 years to less than 18 years, or in mL/min/1.73m2 for \n\nchildren 6 years to less than 13 years. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents (6 years to less than 18 years with a body weight less than 50 kg), and infants and \n\nchildren (6 months to less than 6 years) with creatinine clearance (CLcr) or clearance by continual renal \n\nreplacement therapy (CLCRRT) <80 mL/min should receive an initial dose followed by an appropriate \n\ntwice-daily maintenance dose as shown in Tables 3, 4 and 5. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nTable 3: Initial and maintenance dose regimens for children and adolescents (6 years to less than 18 \n\nyears, with a body weight less than 50 kg) with renal impairment \n\n \n\nCLcr or CLCRRT)  \n(mL/min or \n\nmL/min/1.73m2)* \n\nInitial dose Maintenance Dose Maintenance Dose Schedule \n\n50 to <80 12 mg/kg 8 mg/kg twice daily \nBegin twice daily maintenance \n\ndosing 12 hours after the initial \n\ndose \n30 to <50 12 mg/kg 5 mg/kg twice daily \n\n15 to <30 12 mg/kg 3 mg/kg twice daily \n\nBegin twice daily maintenance \n\ndosing 24 hours after the initial \n\ndose \n\n< 15 12 mg/kg \n1.2 mg/kg twice \n\ndaily \n\nBegin twice daily maintenance \n\ndosing 48 hours after the initial \n\ndose \n\n*CLcr or CLCRRT units in mL/min for adolescents 13 years to less than 18 years, or in mL/min/1.73m2 for \n\nchildren 6 years to less than 13 years. \n\n \n\nTable 4: Initial and maintenance dose regimens for infants and children (6 months to less than 6 years, \n\nwith a body weight of 42.8 kg or above) with renal impairment \n\n \n\nCLcr or CLCRRT \n\n(mL/min/1.73 m2) \nInitial dose Maintenance Dose Maintenance Dose Schedule \n\n50 to <80 600 mg 400 mg twice daily \nBegin twice daily maintenance \n\ndosing 12 hours after the initial \n\ndose \n30 to <50 600 mg 250 mg twice daily \n\n15 to <30 600 mg 150 mg twice daily \n\nBegin twice daily maintenance \n\ndosing 24 hours after the initial \n\ndose \n\n< 15 600 mg 60 mg twice daily \n\nBegin twice daily maintenance \n\ndosing 48 hours after the initial \n\ndose \n\n \n\nTable 5: Initial and maintenance dose regimens for infants and children (6 months to less than 6 years, \n\nwith a body weight less than 42.8 kg) with renal impairment \n\n \n\nCLcr or CLCRRT \n(mL/min/1.73 m2) \n\nInitial dose Maintenance Dose Maintenance Dose Schedule \n\n50 to <80 14 mg/kg \n9.3 mg/kg twice \n\ndaily \n\nBegin twice daily maintenance \n\ndosing 12 hours after the initial \n\ndose \n30 to <50 14 mg/kg \n\n5.8 mg/kg twice \n\ndaily \n\n15 to <30 14 mg/kg \n3.5 mg/kg twice \n\ndaily \n\nBegin twice daily maintenance \n\ndosing 24 hours after the initial \n\ndose \n\n< 15 14 mg/kg \n1.4 mg/kg twice \n\ndaily \n\nBegin twice daily maintenance \n\ndosing 48 hours after the initial \n\ndose \n\n \n\nFor patients on intermittent haemodialysis or intermittent peritoneal dialysis, the dose should be given after \n\ncompletion of the dialysis session. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nFor patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, the dose should be selected using the \n\nappropriate CRRT clearance (CLCRRT in mL/min). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose modification is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nIntravenous use \n\n \n\nDectova is administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nZanamivir is eliminated by renal clearance, therefore the dose of Dectova when administered intravenously \n\nmust be reduced in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2). All patients must have their renal \n\nfunction assessed before and regularly during treatment. \n\n \n\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions (including erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with zanamivir (see section 4.8). If any \n\nhypersensitivity reaction occurs during infusion of Dectova, the infusion must be stopped immediately and \n\nappropriate management should be instituted. \n\n \n\nNeuropsychiatric events \n\n \n\nInfluenza can be associated with a variety of neurological and behavioural symptoms. Neuropsychiatric \n\nevents, including seizures, delirium, hallucination and abnormal behaviour, have been reported during \n\nadministration of zanamivir in patients with influenza, especially in children and adolescents. Therefore, \n\npatients should be closely monitored for behavioural changes and the benefits and risks of continuing \n\ntreatment should be carefully evaluated for each patient (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nResistance in immunocompromised patients \n\n \n\nTreatment emergent resistance is rare with zanamivir (see section 5.1). Selection of influenza resistant \n\nviruses is more likely to occur following treatment with antiviral medicinal products in immunocompromised \n\npatients, including treatment with Dectova; it is, therefore, important to monitor for resistance and consider \n\nswitching to alternative therapies where appropriate. \n\n \n\nLimitations of the clinical data \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of Dectova for the treatment of complicated influenza A or B virus infection in adults and \n\nchildren aged from 6 months has been inferred from: \n\n \n\n• the in vitro activity of zanamivir; \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n• clinical and virological activity of zanamivir compared to placebo in a human influenza challenge \n\nstudy; \n\n• levels of zanamivir in broncho-epithelial lining fluid and serum zanamivir from a broncho-alveolar \n\nlavage study; \n\n• serum zanamivir levels from patients with complicated influenza (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nRisk of bacterial infections \n\n \n\nDectova has not been shown to reduce the risk of bacterial complications associated with influenza infection. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 70.8 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 3.54% of the WHO recommended \n\nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThe potential for interactions with other medicines is low, based on the known elimination pathway of \n\nzanamivir. \n\n \n\nZanamivir is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes nor a substrate or inhibitor \n\nof renal and hepatic transporters at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nThere was no evidence of interaction with oral oseltamivir in a clinical study. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are limited data from the use of zanamivir in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \n\nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nReproductive studies performed in rats and rabbits indicated that placental transfer of zanamivir occurs and \n\nthere was no evidence of teratogenicity. Results from a rat peri- and postnatal study showed no clinically \n\nmeaningful impairment of offspring development. However, there is no information on placental transfer in \n\nhumans. \n\n \n\nAs experience is limited, the use of Dectova in pregnancy should only be considered if the possible benefit to \n\nthe patient is thought to outweigh any possible risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether zanamivir is excreted in human milk. In rats, zanamivir has been shown to be secreted \n\nin low amounts into milk. \n\n \n\nAs experience is limited, the use of zanamivir in breast-feeding mothers should be considered only if the \n\npossible benefit to the mother is thought to outweigh any possible risk to the child. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nAnimal studies indicate no clinically meaningful effects of zanamivir on male or female fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nDectova has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of Dectova is based primarily on data from a single Phase II and a single Phase III study, \n\nwith support from Phase I studies, a compassionate use programme, and adverse drug reactions reported for \n\ninhaled zanamivir. The frequency of adverse reactions is based on the number of reports in the adult \n\npopulation receiving zanamivir 600 mg twice daily intravenously in the Phase II and Phase III studies. \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class. \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to Dectova are \n\nalanine aminotransferase increased (2%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (1%), hepatocellular injury \n\n(1%), diarrhoea (1%) and rash (1%). The most important serious adverse reaction was hepatocellular injury, \n\nobserved in two patients (<1%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \n\ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reactions Frequency \n\nImmune system disorders oropharyngeal oedema \n\nfacial oedema \n\nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions \n\n \n\nnot known \n\nPsychiatric disorders abnormal behaviour \n\nhallucinations \n\ndelirium \n\n \n\nnot known \n\nNervous system disorders convulsions \n\ndepressed level of consciousness \n\n \n\nnot known \n\nGastrointestinal disorders diarrhoea \n\n \n\ncommon \n\nHepatobiliary disorders alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate \n\naminotransferase (AST) increased \n\nhepatocellular injury \n\n \n\ncommon \n\nalkaline phosphatase increased \n\n \n\nuncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nrash \n\n \n\ncommon \n\nurticaria \n\n \n\nuncommon \n\nerythema multiforme \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome \n\ntoxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n \n\nnot known \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe adverse reaction profile in the paediatric population is based on 71 patients aged ≥6 months to <18 years \n\nin the Phase II study.

It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience of overdose from administration of Dectova. There is no specific antidote to treat \n\nan overdose of this medicine. Treatment of an overdose should consist of general supportive measures \n\nincluding monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. Zanamivir is cleared \n\nby renal excretion and is expected to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, neuraminidase inhibitors \n\nATC code: J05AH01 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nZanamivir is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase, an enzyme that releases viral particles from the \n\nplasma membrane of infected cells and promotes virus spread in the respiratory tract.  \n\n \n\nIn vitro activity \n\n \n\nNeuraminidase inhibition occurred at very low zanamivir concentrations in vitro, with median inhibitory \n\n(IC50) values of 0.33 nM to 5.77 nM against influenza A and B strains respectively. \n\n \n\nResistance \n\nResistance selection during zanamivir treatment is rare. Reduced susceptibility to zanamivir is associated \n\nwith mutations that result in amino acid changes in the viral neuraminidase or viral hemagglutinin or both. \n\nNeuraminidase substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to zanamivir have emerged during treatment \n\nwith zanamivir in human viruses and those with zoonotic potential: E119D, E119G, I223R, R368G, G370D, \n\nN434S (A/H1N1); N294S, T325I (A/H3N2); R150K (B); R292K (A/H7N9). The neuraminidase substitution \n\nQ136K (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), confers high level resistance to zanamivir but is selected during adaptation \n\nto cell culture and not during treatment. \n\n \n\nThe clinical impact of reduced susceptibility in these viruses is unknown, and the effects of specific \n\nsubstitutions on virus susceptibility to zanamivir may be strain-dependent. \n\n \n\nCross-resistance \n\nCross-resistance between zanamivir and oseltamivir or peramivir has been observed in neuraminidase \n\ninhibition assays. A number of neuraminidase amino acid substitutions that arise during oseltamivir or \n\nperamivir treatment result in reduced susceptibility to zanamivir. The clinical impact of substitutions \n\nassociated with reduced susceptibility to zanamivir and other neuraminidase inhibitors is variable and may \n\nbe strain-dependent. \n\n \n\nThe H275Y substitution is the most common neuraminidase resistance substitution and is associated with \n\nreduced susceptibility to peramivir and oseltamivir. This substitution has no effect on zanamivir; therefore, \n\nviruses with the H275Y substitution retain full susceptibility to zanamivir. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nHuman challenge study \n\nA double-blind, randomised study to examine the prophylactic antiviral activity and efficacy of repeat dose \n\nzanamivir 600 mg every 12 hours intravenously compared to placebo in healthy male volunteers against \n\ninfection from inoculation with influenza A/Texas/91 (H1N1) virus was conducted. Zanamivir had a \n\nsignificant prophylactic effect against an experimental challenge with influenza A virus as demonstrated by \n\nthe low infection rate (14% vs. 100% positive serology in placebo group, p <0.005), isolation of virus by \n\nviral culture (0% vs. 100% in placebo group, p <0.005), as well as reductions in fever (14% vs. 88% in \n\nplacebo group, p <0.05), upper respiratory tract illness (0% versus 100% in placebo group, p<0.005) and \n\ntotal symptom scores (1 vs. 44 median score in placebo group, p<0.001). \n\n \n\nBronchoalveolar lavage study \n\nA Phase I, open-label study to evaluate serum and lower respiratory pharmacokinetics following \n\nadministration of intravenous and inhaled zanamivir to healthy adult subjects utilising bronchoalveolar \n\nlavage fluid was conducted. The 600 mg dose given intravenously best approximated epithelial lining fluid \n\nconcentrations achieved by the approved 10 mg dose of zanamivir inhalation powder which demonstrated \n\nefficacy in large clinical studies in uncomplicated influenza. \n\n \n\nPhase III study in patients with complicated influenza \n\nA Phase III, double-blind, study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, antiviral activity and safety of \n\nzanamivir 600 mg twice daily intravenously compared to oral oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily and 300 mg \n\nzanamivir twice daily intravenously in hospitalised patients (>16 years of age) with influenza. The median \n\npatient age was 57 years and 35% (218/615) of patients were ≥65 years, of which 17% (n=103) were 65 to \n\n<75; 14% (n=84) were 75 to <85, and 5% (n=31) were ≥85 years of age. Patients were stratified at \n\nrandomisation based on time from onset of symptoms to initiation of treatment (≤4 days and 5 to 6 days). \n\nEligible patients were not to have had >3 days of prior antiviral treatment. The initial 5 day treatment course \n\ncould be extended for up to 5 additional days if clinical symptoms or patient characteristics warranted further \n\ntreatment. The primary endpoint was time to clinical response (TTCR); clinical response was defined as a \n\ncomposite of vital sign stabilisation (temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory status, heart rate and \n\nsystolic blood pressure) or hospital discharge. The primary analysis was performed on the Influenza Positive \n\nPopulation (IPP) comprised of 488 patients. The study did not meet its pre-specified primary objective of \n\ndemonstrating superiority of 600 mg zanamivir to oral oseltamivir or to 300 mg zanamivir in TTCR. There \n\nwere no significant differences in TTCR across treatment comparisons in the overall IPP or in two pre-\n\nspecified subgroups (Table 6). \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nTable 6: Statistical comparisons of TTCR between the 600 mg zanamivir group and each other group \n\n(IPP) \n\n \n\n Zanamivir \n\nsolution for \n\ninfusion  \n\n300 mg \n\nZanamivir \n\nsolution for \n\ninfusion \n\n600 mg \n\nOseltamivir \n\n75 mg \n\nInfluenza Positive Population, N 163 162 163 \n\nMedian TTCR, days 5.87 5.14 5.63 \n\nMedian difference between treatments, days (95% CI) -0.73 (-1.79, 0.75) -0.48 (-2.11, 0.97) \n\np-value from Wilcoxon rank-sum 2-sided test 0.25 0.39 \n\nIntensive Care Unit/Mechanical Ventilation subgroup, N 68 54 68 \n\nMedian TTCR, days 11.26 12.79 14.58 \n\nMedian difference between treatments, days (95% CI) 1.53 (-4.29, 8.34) -1.79 (-11.1, 6.92) \n\np-value from Wilcoxon rank-sum 2-sided test 0.87 0.51 \n\nSymptom onset 4 days subgroup, N 127 131 121 \n\nMedian TTCR, days 5.63 4.80 4.80 \n\nMedian difference between treatments, days (95% CI) -0.83 (-1.98, 0.56) 0.00 (-1.05, 0.97) \n\np-value from Wilcoxon rank-sum 2-sided test 0.09 0.82 \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. \n\nThis means that for scientific reasons it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this \n\nmedicinal product. \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year \n\nand this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Dectova in \n\none or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment and prevention of influenza (see section 4.2 \n\nfor information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe serum pharmacokinetics of zanamivir administered intravenously have been studied in healthy \n\nvolunteers receiving single escalating doses from 1 to 1200 mg and repeated doses of 600 mg twice daily for \n\n5 days. Hospitalised patients with influenza also have received 300 mg or 600 mg twice daily for 5 to \n\n10 days. \n\n \n\nDose proportionality was observed in zanamivir Cmax and AUC and no accumulation of zanamivir in serum \n\nwas evident after repeated intravenous doses of up to 600 mg. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe plasma protein binding of zanamivir is very low (less than 10%). The volume of distribution of \n\nzanamivir in adults is approximately 16 litres, which approximates the volume of extracellular water. \n\n \n\nFollowing twice-daily administration of zanamivir solution for infusion, pulmonary epithelial lining fluid \n\nconcentrations were 60 - 65 % of the serum concentrations at the corresponding sampling time 12 hours after \n\ndosing. Following twice daily administration of 600 mg zanamivir solution for infusion, median trough \n\nzanamivir epithelial lining fluid concentrations ranged from 419 ng/mL to 584 ng/mL and were 47-66% of \n\nthose in the initial bronchoalveolar sample following orally zanamivir inhalation powder 10 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that zanamivir is metabolised. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nZanamivir is eliminated unchanged in urine by glomerular filtration. In adults with normal renal function, the \n\nelimination half-life is approximately 2-3 hours. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics in elderly subjects was similar to young adult subjects. In the population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis, age had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of zanamivir. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of zanamivir following a twice daily intravenous dose of 14 mg/kg for paediatric \n\npatients between 6 months and <6 years and 12 mg/kg for those between 6 years and <18 years of age were \n\nsimilar to those seen in adults who received 600 mg twice daily intravenously. The pharmacokinetics of \n\nzanamivir in subjects 6 months to <18 years of age (administered standard dose of 12 mg/kg, 14 mg/kg or \n\n600 mg according to age and body weight) and in adult subjects (administered standard dose of 600 mg) was \n\nsimilar (Table 7). \n\n \n\nTable 7: Pharmacokinetic parameters in paediatric and adult subjects \n\nAge \n\nGroup \n\nDose N Cmax  \n\n(g/mL) \n\nAUC(0-)  \n\n(g.h/mL) \n\nCmin  \n\n(g/mL) \n\nT1/2 \n\n(h) \n\nGM %CV GM %CV GM Range GM %CV \n\n6 months \n\n- <1 year  \n\n14 \n\nmg/kg \n\n7 36.2 21 75.3 23 NA NA 1.84 19 \n\n1 - <2 \n\nyears  \n\n14 \n\nmg/kg \n\n6 37.8 24 72.4 14 0.305  NA 2.49 118 \n\n2 - <6 \n\nyears  \n\n14 \n\nmg/kg \n\n12 41.5 23 80.3 38 0.277  0.133 – 0.984 1.60 34 \n\n6 - <13 \n\nyears \n\n12 \n\nmg/kg \n\n16 44.2 47 107 41 0.564  0.111 – 2.31 2.57 55 \n\n13 - <18 \n\nyears  \n\n600 \n\nmg \n\n13 34.5 27 91.1 27 0.211  0.104 – 0.428 2.06 47 \n\n>18 \n\nyears \n\n600 \n\nmg \n\n67 32.8 34 82.9 36 \n0.82 0.1 - 11.4 2.39 31 \n\n%CV = percent coefficient of variation, GM = Geometric Mean, NA = Not available \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nThe serum half-life of zanamivir increases to approximately 12-20 hours in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). Dectova has not been studied in patients with end-stage \n\nrenal disease. \n\n \n\nThere are limited data on zanamivir exposure during concomitant continuous renal replacement therapy and \n\nvery limited data with dialysis. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nZanamivir is not metabolised, therefore no effect of hepatic impairment is expected. \n\n \n\nRace \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic studies in Thai, Chinese and Japanese healthy subjects did not identify any clinically \n\nrelevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of zanamivir in these populations compared with Caucasians. \n\n \n\nDrug interactions \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that zanamivir is not an inhibitor or substrate of Breast Cancer Resistant Protein \n\n(BCRP), P-glycoprotein, Multidrug And Toxin Extrusion protein (MATE)1, MATE2-K, Organic Anion \n\nTransporter (OAT)1, OAT3, Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 and Organic \n\nCation Transporter (OCT)2 transporters, nor is it an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP1A2, \n\n2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. \n\n \n\nZanamivir is not an inducer of CYP1A2 and 2B6 and, although induction of CYP3A4 in vitro was observed \n\nat 50-fold higher than the clinically relevant concentrations, no interaction with CYP3A4 substrates is \n\nexpected based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \n\nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, or toxicity to reproduction and development, \n\nwith the exception of a rat embryofoetal development study (subcutaneous administration). In the rat \n\nembryofoetal study, there was an increase in the incidence rates of a variety of minor skeletal and visceral \n\nalterations, most of which remained within the background rates of the historical occurrence in the strain \n\nstudied. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \n\nDectova 10 mg/mL solution for infusion \n\nzanamivir \n\n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \n\nreport side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Dectova is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Dectova \n\n3. How Dectova is given \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Dectova \n\n6.  Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Dectova is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nDectova contains zanamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines called antivirals. \n\nDectova is used to treat severe flu (influenza virus infection). It is used when other flu treatments are not \n\nsuitable. \n\nAdults and children aged 6 months or more can be treated with Dectova. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Dectova  \n\n \n\nDo not use Dectova: \n\n• if you are allergic to zanamivir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nSerious skin or allergic reactions \n\n \n\nSerious skin or allergic reactions may occur after Dectova is given. Symptoms may include skin or throat \n\nswelling, difficulty breathing, blistering rash or peeling skin (see also ‘Serious skin or allergic reactions’ in \n\nsection 4). \n\n \n\nSudden changes in behaviour, hallucinations and fits \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Dectova, changes in behaviour such as confusion and unresponsiveness may occur. \n\nSome people may also have hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there) or fits \n\n(seizures) which can lead to loss of consciousness. These symptoms also occur in people with flu who are \n\nnot being given Dectova. So it is not known if Dectova played a part in causing them. \n\n \n\nIf you notice any of the above symptoms: \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n➔ Tell a doctor or nurse immediately. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Dectova \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \n\ndoctor for advice before you are given this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDectova should not affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\nDectova contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains 70.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is \n\nequivalent to 3.54% of the recommended maximum daily intake of sodium for an adult. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Dectova is given \n\n \n\nHow much Dectova is given \n\nYour doctor will decide how much Dectova is right for you. The amount you are given is based on your age, \n\nbody weight, and the results of your blood tests (to check how well your kidneys are working). \n\n \n\nYour dose may be increased or decreased depending on how well you respond to treatment. \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose is 600 mg twice daily for 5 to 10 days. \n\n \n\nIf your kidneys are not working as well as they should, your doctor will decide on the reduced dose for you. \n\n \n\nChildren  \n\nYour doctor will decide on the correct dose of Dectova. \n\n \n\nWhen and how Dectova is given \n\nDectova should be given as soon as possible, usually within 6 days of the symptoms of flu appearing. \n\n \n\nA doctor or nurse will give you Dectova as an infusion (drip) into a vein. It is usually given into your arm \n\nover about 30 minutes. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions on the use of Dectova, ask the doctor or nurse who is giving it you. \n\n \n\nIf you are given more Dectova than you should \n\nIt is unlikely that you will be given too much, but if you think you have been given too much Dectova, tell \n\nyour doctor or nurse immediately. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, Dectova can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\nSerious skin and allergic reactions may occur with Dectova, but there isn’t enough information to \n\nestimate how likely they are. Contact your doctor or nurse straight away if you notice any of the following \n\nserious side effects: \n\n• very severe skin reactions such as: \no a skin rash, which may blister, and looks like small targets (erythema multiforme) \no a widespread rash with blisters and peeling skin, particularly occurring around the mouth, \n\nnose, eyes and genitals (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) \n\no extensive peeling of the skin on much of the body surface (toxic epidermal necrolysis). \n\n• severe allergic reactions, including features such as itchy rash, swelling of the face, throat or tongue, \nbreathing difficulty, light headedness and vomiting. \n\n \n\nCommon side effects \n\nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\n• diarrhoea \n\n• liver damage (hepatocellular injury) \n\n• rash. \n\n \n\nCommon side effects that may show up in your blood tests: \n\n• increase in the level of liver enzymes (raised aminotransferases). \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects \n\nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\n• itchy, bumpy rash (hives). \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects that may show up in your blood tests: \n\n• increase in the level of liver or bone enzymes (raised alkaline phosphatase). \n\n \n\nSide effects where it is not known how likely they are to happen \n\nThere isn’t enough information to estimate how likely these side effects are: \n\n• acting strangely \n\n• seeing, hearing or feeling things which are not there \n\n• confused thinking \n\n• fits (seizures) \n\n• being less alert or not responding to loud sounds or being shaken \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects  \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in \n\nthis leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Dectova \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and vial after EXP. \n\n \n\nVials of Dectova are for single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\nWhat Dectova contains \n\nThe active substance is zanamivir. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nEach mL of Dectova contains 10 mg of zanamivir (as hydrate). Each vial contains 200 mg of zanamivir (as \n\nhydrate). \n\nOther ingredients are sodium chloride and water for injections. \n\n \n\nWhat Dectova looks like and contents of the pack \n\nDectova is a clear, colourless solution for infusion containing 200 mg zanamivir (as hydrate) in 20 mL. It is \n\nsupplied in a 26 mL clear glass vial with a rubber stopper and an aluminium over-seal with a plastic flip off \n\ncap. \n\n \n\nThere is 1 vial in each pack. \n\n \n\nMarketing Authorisation Holder \n\nGlaxoSmithKline Trading Services Limited \n\n12 Riverwalk \n\nCitywest Business Campus \n\nDublin 24 \n\nIreland \n\n \n\nManufacturer \n\nGlaxo Operations UK Ltd (trading as Glaxo Wellcome Operations) \n\nHarmire Road \n\nBarnard Castle \n\nCounty Durham \n\nDL12 8DT  \n\nUK \n\n \n\nOr \n\n \n\nGlaxoSmithKline Manufacturing S.P.A \n\nStrada Provinciale Asolana, 90 \n\n43056 San Polo di Torrile \n\nParma \n\nItaly \n\n \n\nFor any information about this medicine, please contact the local representative of the Marketing \n\nAuthorisation Holder: \n\n \n\nBelgië/Belgique/Belgien  \n\nGlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals s.a./n.v. \n\nTél/Tel: + 32 (0) 10 85 52 00 \n\n \n\nLietuva  \n\nGlaxoSmithKline Lietuva UAB \n\nTel: + 370 5 264 90 00 \n\ninfo.lt@gsk.com \n\n \n\nБългария  \n\nГлаксоСмитКлайн ЕООД  \n\nTeл.: + 359 2 953 10 34 \n\n \n\n \n\nLuxembourg/Luxemburg  \n\nGlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals s.a./n.v. \n\nBelgique/Belgien \n\nTél/Tel: + 32 (0) 10 85 52 00 \n\n \n\nČeská republika  \n\nGlaxoSmithKline, s.r.o. \n\nTel: + 420 222 001 111 \n\ncz.info@gsk.com \n\nMagyarország  \n\nGlaxoSmithKline Kft. \n\nTel.: + 36 1 225 5300 \n\n \n\nDanmark  \n\nGlaxoSmithKline Pharma A/S \n\nTlf: + 45 36 35 91 00 \n\n \n\nMalta  \n\nGlaxoSmithKline (Malta) Limited \n\nTel: + 356 21 238131 \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\ndk-info@gsk.com \n\n \n\nDeutschland  \n\nGlaxoSmithKline GmbH & Co.

INFORMATION FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS \n\n \n\nDectova preparation \n\n \n\n• The volume of Dectova and total volume for infusion will depend on the patient’s age, weight and \nrenal function (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). \n\n• The dose can be infused as supplied or diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection down to any concentration greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/mL. \n\n• Each vial is for single use only; once the seal has been broken, the remaining volume must be \ndiscarded. \n\n \n\nHow to prepare the infusion for intravenous administration: \n\n \n\n• Use aseptic techniques throughout preparation of the dose. \n\n• Calculate the required dose and volume of Dectova. \n\n• Decide on the volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to be used for \ninfusion. \n\n• Using a sterile needle and syringe, withdraw and discard a volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for injection (equal to the volume of Dectova) from the infusion bag. \n\n• Infusion bags may have a further overage of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection \nincluded – this can also be removed if considered necessary. \n\n• Using a sterile needle and syringe, withdraw the volume of Dectova from the vial(s) and add to the \ninfusion bag. \n\n• Discard any unused portion of the vial. \n\n• The infusion bag should be gently manipulated by hand to ensure it is mixed thoroughly. \n\n• If refrigerated, the infusion bag should be removed from the refrigerator and brought up to room \ntemperature before use. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
