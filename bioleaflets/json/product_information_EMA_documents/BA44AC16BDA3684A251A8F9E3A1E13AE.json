PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection).\nClear and colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nIn adult females:\nPuregon is indicated for the treatment of female infertility in the following clinical situations:\n Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS) in women who have been \n\nunresponsive to treatment with clomifene citrate.\n Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation to induce the development of multiple follicles in \n\nmedically assisted reproduction programs [e.g. in vitro fertilisation/embryo transfer (IVF/ET), \ngamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)].\n\nIn adult males:\n Deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Puregon should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nThe first injection with Puregon should be performed under direct medical supervision.\n\nPosology\n\nDosage in the female\nThere are great inter- and intra-individual variations in the response of the ovaries to exogenous \ngonadotrophins. This makes it impossible to set a uniform dosage scheme. The dosage should, \ntherefore, be adjusted individually depending on the ovarian response. This requires ultrasound \nassessment of follicular development. The concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may \nalso be useful.\nBased on the results of comparative clinical studies, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total \ndosage of Puregon over a shorter treatment period than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in \norder to optimise follicular development but also to reduce the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation (see section 5.1).\n\nClinical experience with Puregon is based on up to three treatment cycles in both indications. Overall \nexperience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first \nfour attempts and gradually declines thereafter.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\n Anovulation\nA sequential treatment scheme is recommended starting with daily administration of 50 IU \nPuregon. The starting dose is maintained for at least seven days. If there is no ovarian response, \nthe daily dose is then gradually increased until follicle growth and/or plasma oestradiol levels \nindicate an adequate pharmacodynamic response. A daily increase of oestradiol levels of \n40-100% is considered to be optimal. The daily dose is then maintained until pre-ovulatory \nconditions are reached. Pre-ovulatory conditions are reached when there is ultrasonographic \nevidence of a dominant follicle of at least 18 mm in diameter and/or when plasma oestradiol \nlevels of 300-900 picograms/mL (1,000-3,000 pmol/L) are attained. Usually, 7 to 14 days of \ntreatment is sufficient to reach this state. The administration of Puregon is then discontinued and \novulation can be induced by administering human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).\nIf the number of responding follicles is too high or oestradiol levels increase too rapidly, i.e. \nmore than a daily doubling for oestradiol for two or three consecutive days, the daily dose \nshould be decreased.\nSince follicles of over 14 mm may lead to pregnancies, multiple pre-ovulatory follicles \nexceeding 14 mm carry the risk of multiple gestations. In that case hCG should be withheld and \npregnancy should be avoided in order to prevent multiple gestations.\n\n Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in medically assisted reproduction programs\nVarious stimulation protocols are applied. A starting dose of 100-225 IU is recommended for at \nleast the first four days. Thereafter, the dose may be adjusted individually, based upon ovarian \nresponse. In clinical studies it was shown that maintenance dosages ranging from 75-375 IU for \nsix to twelve days are sufficient, although longer treatment may be necessary.\nPuregon can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a \nGnRH agonist or antagonist. When using a GnRH agonist, a higher total treatment dose of \nPuregon may be required to achieve an adequate follicular response.\nOvarian response is monitored by ultrasound assessment. The concurrent determination of \nserum oestradiol levels may also be useful. When ultrasound assessment indicates the presence \nof at least three follicles of 16-20 mm, and there is evidence of a good oestradiol response \n(plasma levels of about 300-400 picograms/mL (1,000-1,300 pmol/L) for each follicle with a \ndiameter greater than 18 mm), the final phase of maturation of the follicles is induced by \nadministration of hCG. Oocyte retrieval is performed 34-35 hours later.\n\nDosage in the male\nPuregon should be given at a dosage of 450 IU/week, preferably divided in 3 dosages of 150 IU, \nconcomitantly with hCG. Treatment with Puregon and hCG should be continued for at least 3 to \n4 months before any improvement in spermatogenesis can be expected. To assess the response, semen \nanalysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment. If a patient has not responded \nafter this period, the combination therapy may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that \ntreatment for up to 18 months or longer may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of Puregon in the paediatric population for the approved indication.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTo prevent painful injections and minimise leakage from the injection site Puregon should be slowly \nadministered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The subcutaneous injection site should be alternated \nto prevent lipoatrophy. Any unused solution should be discarded.\nSubcutaneous injection of Puregon may be carried out by patient or partner, provided that proper \ninstructions are given by the physician. Self-administration of Puregon should only be performed by \npatients who are well-motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nFor males and females\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Tumours of the ovary, breast, uterus, testis, pituitary or hypothalamus.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\n Primary gonadal failure.\n\nAdditionally for females\n Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.\n Ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries, not related to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\n Malformations of the reproductive organs incompatible with pregnancy.\n Fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAntibiotic hypersensitivity reactions\n Puregon may contain traces of streptomycin and/or neomycin. These antibiotics may cause \n\nhypersensitivity reactions in susceptible persons.\n\nInfertility evaluation before starting treatment\n Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate. In particular, \n\npatients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical insufficiency, \nhyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven.\n\nIn females\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nOHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement. Clinical signs and \nsymptoms of mild and moderate OHSS are abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, mild to moderate \nenlargement of ovaries and ovarian cysts. Severe OHSS may be life-threatening. Clinical signs and \nsymptoms of severe OHSS are large ovarian cysts, acute abdominal pain, ascites, pleural effusion, \nhydrothorax, dyspnoea, oliguria, haematological abnormalities and weight gain. In rare instances, \nvenous or arterial thromboembolism may occur in association with OHSS. Transient liver function test \nabnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction with or without morphologic changes on liver biopsy \nhave also been reported in association with OHSS.\n\nOHSS may be caused by administration of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and by pregnancy \n(endogenous hCG). Early OHSS usually occurs within 10 days after hCG administration and may be \nassociated with an excessive ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation. Late OHSS occurs more \nthan 10 days after hCG administration, as a consequence of the hormonal changes with pregnancy. \nBecause of the risk of developing OHSS, patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after \nhCG administration.\n\nWomen with known risk factors for a high ovarian response may be especially prone to the \ndevelopment of OHSS during or following treatment with Puregon. For women having their first cycle \nof ovarian stimulation, for whom risk factors are only partially known, close observation for early \nsigns and symptoms of OHSS is recommended.\n\nFollow current clinical practice for reducing the risk of OHSS during Assisted Reproductive \nTechnology (ART). Adherence to the recommended Puregon dose and treatment regimen and careful \nmonitoring of ovarian response is important to reduce the risk of OHSS. To monitor the risk of OHSS, \nultrasonographic assessments of follicular development should be performed prior to treatment and at \nregular intervals during treatment; the concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may also be \nuseful. In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with 18 or more follicles of 11 mm or more in \ndiameter. \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nIf OHSS develops, standard and appropriate management of OHSS should be implemented and \nfollowed.\n\nMultiple Pregnancy\nMultiple pregnancies and births have been reported for all gonadotropin treatments, including \nPuregon. Multiple gestation, especially high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal \n(pregnancy and delivery complications) and perinatal (low birth weight) outcomes. For anovulatory \nwomen undergoing ovulation induction, monitoring follicular development with transvaginal \nultrasonography may aid in determining whether or not to continue the cycle in order to reduce the \nrisk of multiple pregnancies. The concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may also be \nuseful. The patients should be advised of the potential risks of multiple births before starting \ntreatment.\n\nIn women undergoing Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) procedures, the risk of a multiple \npregnancy is mainly related to the number of embryos transferred. When used for an ovulation \ninduction cycle, appropriate FSH dose adjustment(s) should prevent multiple follicle development.\n\nEctopic Pregnancy\nInfertile women undergoing ART have an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancies. Early \nultrasound confirmation that a pregnancy is intrauterine is therefore important.\n\nSpontaneous Abortion\nRates of pregnancy loss in women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques are higher than in the \nnormal population.\n\nVascular Complications\nThromboembolic events, both in association with and separate from OHSS, have been reported \nfollowing treatment with gonadotropins, including Puregon. Intravascular thrombosis, which may \noriginate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to vital organs or the \nextremities. In women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as a \npersonal or family history, severe obesity or thrombophilia, treatment with gonadotropins, including \nPuregon, may further increase this risk. In these women the benefits of gonadotropin administration,\nincluding Puregon, need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted, however, that pregnancy \nitself also carries an increased risk of thrombosis.\n\nCongenital Malformations\nThe incidence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple gestations.\n\nOvarian Torsion\nOvarian torsion has been reported after treatment with gonadotropins, including Puregon. Ovarian \ntorsion may be associated with other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal \nsurgery, past history of ovarian torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovaries. \nDamage to the ovary due to reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate \ndetorsion.\n\nOvarian and Other Reproductive System Neoplasms\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women.\n\nOther Medical Conditions\nMedical conditions that contraindicate pregnancy should also be evaluated before starting treatment \nwith Puregon.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nIn males\n\nPrimary Testicular Failure\nElevated endogenous FSH levels in men are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to Puregon/hCG therapy.\n\nSodium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nConcomitant use of Puregon and clomifene citrate may enhance the follicular response. After pituitary \ndesensitisation induced by a GnRH agonist, a higher dose of Puregon may be necessary to achieve an \nadequate follicular response.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nFertility\nPuregon is used in the treatment of women undergoing ovarian induction or controlled ovarian \nhyperstimulation in assisted reproduction programmes. In males Puregon is used in the treatment of \ndeficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. For posology and method of \nadministration, see section 4.2.\n\nPregnancy\nThe use of Puregon during pregnancy is not indicated. In case of inadvertent exposure during \npregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant FSH. \nHowever, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported. No teratogenic effect has been \nobserved in animal studies. \n\nBreast-feeding\nThere is no information available from clinical or animal studies on the excretion of follitropin beta in \nmilk. It is unlikely that follitropin beta is excreted in human milk due to its high molecular weight. If \nfollitropin beta would be excreted in human milk, it would be degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of \nthe child. Follitropin beta may affect milk production.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPuregon has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nClinical use of Puregon by the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes may lead to local reactions at the \nsite of injection (3% of all patients treated). The majority of these local reactions are mild and transient \nin nature. Generalised hypersensitivity reactions been observed uncommonly (approximately 0.2% of \nall patients treated with follitropin beta).\n\nTreatment of females:\nIn approximately 4% of the women treated with follitropin beta in clinical trials, signs and symptoms \nrelated to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) have been reported (see section 4.4). Adverse \nreactions related to this syndrome include pelvic pain and/or congestion, abdominal pain and/or \ndistension, breast complaints and ovarian enlargement.\n\nThe table below lists the adverse reactions with follitropin beta reported in clinical trials in females, \naccording to system organ class and frequency; common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100).\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nSOC Frequency Adverse reaction\nNervous system disorders Common Headache \nGastrointestinal disorders Common Abdominal distension \n\nAbdominal pain\nUncommon Abdominal discomfort\n\nConstipation\nDiarrhoea\nNausea\n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders\n\nCommon OHSS\nPelvic pain\n\nUncommon Breast complaints1\n\nMetrorrhagia\nOvarian cyst\nOvarian enlargement\nOvarian torsion\nUterine enlargement\nVaginal haemorrhage \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nCommon Injection site reaction2\n\nUncommon Generalised hypersensitivity \nreaction3\n\n1.

Generalised hypersensitivity reaction include erythema, urticaria, rash and pruritus\n\nIn addition, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage and multiple gestations have been reported. These are \nconsidered to be related to ART or subsequent pregnancy.\n\nIn rare instances, thromboembolism has been associated with follitropin beta /hCG therapy as with \nother gonadotrophins. \n\nTreatment of males:\nThe table below lists the adverse reactions with follitropin beta reported in a clinical trial in males \n(30 patients dosed), according to system organ class and frequency; common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10).\n\nSOC Frequency1 Adverse reaction\nNervous system disorders Common Headache\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nCommon Acne\nRash\n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders\n\nCommon Epididymal cyst\nGynaecomastia\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nCommon Injection site reaction2\n\n1. Adverse reactions that are reported only once are listed as common because a single report raises the \nfrequency above 1%.\n\n2. Local reactions at the site of injection include induration and pain.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo data on acute toxicity of Puregon in humans is available, but the acute toxicity of Puregon and of \nurinary gonadotrophin preparations in animal studies has been shown to be very low. Too high a \ndosage of FSH may lead to hyperstimulation of the ovaries (see section 4.4).\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotrophins; \nATC code: G03G A06.\n\nPuregon contains a recombinant FSH. This is produced by recombinant DNA technology, using a \nChinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with the human FSH subunit genes. The primary amino \nacid sequence is identical to that of natural human FSH. Small differences in the carbohydrate chain \nstructure are known to exist.\n\nMechanism of Action\nFSH is indispensable in normal follicular growth and maturation, and gonadal steroid production. In \nthe female the level of FSH is critical for the onset and duration of follicular development, and \nconsequently for the timing and number of follicles reaching maturity. Puregon can thus be used to \nstimulate follicular development and steroid production in selected cases of disturbed gonadal \nfunction. Furthermore Puregon can be used to promote multiple follicular development in medically \nassisted reproduction programs [e.g. in vitro fertilisation/embryo transfer (IVF/ET), gamete intra-\nfallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]. Treatment with Puregon is \ngenerally followed by administration of hCG to induce the final phase of follicle maturation, \nresumption of meiosis and rupture of the follicle.\n\nClinical Efficacy and Safety\nIn clinical studies comparing recFSH (follitropin beta) and urinary FSH for controlled ovarian \nstimulation in women participating in an Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) program and for \novulation induction (see tables 1 and 2 below), Puregon was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of \na lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation.\n\nFor controlled ovarian stimulation, Puregon resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved at a lower \ntotal dose and with a shorter treatment period, when compared to urinary FSH.\n\nTable 1: Results of study 37,608 (randomized, group comparative clinical study comparing safety and \nefficacy of Puregon with urinary FSH in controlled ovarian stimulation).\n\nPuregon\n(n = 546)\n\nu-FSH\n(n = 361)\n\nMean no. of oocytes retrieved 10.84* 8.95\n\nMean total dose (no. of 75 IU ampoules) 28.5* 31.8\n\nMean duration of FSH stimulation (days) 10.7* 11.3\n\n* Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p0.05).\n\nFor ovulation induction, Puregon resulted in a lower median total dose and shorter median duration of \ntreatment when compared to urinary FSH.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nTable 2: Results of study 37,609 (randomized, group comparative clinical study comparing safety and \nefficacy of Puregon with urinary FSH in ovulation induction).\n\nPuregon\n(n = 105)\n\nu-FSH\n(n = 66)\n\nMean no. of follicles ≥ 12 mm 3.6* 2.6\n\n≥ 15 mm 2.0 1.7\n\n≥ 18 mm 1.1 0.9\n\nMedian total dose (IU)\na 750* 1,035\n\nMedian duration of treatment (days)\na 10.0* 13.0\n\n* Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p0.05).\na\n\nRestricted to women with ovulation induced (Puregon, n = 76; u-FSH, n = 42).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nAfter intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of Puregon, maximum concentrations of FSH are \nreached within about 12 hours. After intramuscular administration of Puregon, the maximum FSH \nconcentrations are higher and reached earlier in men as compared to women. Due to the sustained \nrelease from the injection site and the elimination half-life of about 40 hours (ranging from 12 to \n70 hours), FSH levels remain increased for 24-48 hours. Due to the relatively long elimination \nhalf-life, repeated administration of the same dose will lead to plasma concentrations of FSH that are \napproximately 1.5-2.5 times higher than after single-dose administration. This increase enables \ntherapeutic FSH concentrations to be reached.\nThere are no significant pharmacokinetic differences between intramuscular and subcutaneous \nadministration of Puregon. Both have an absolute bioavailability of approximately 77%.\n\nDistribution, biotransformation and elimination\nRecombinant FSH is biochemically very similar to urinary human FSH and is distributed, \nmetabolised, and excreted in the same way.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-dose administration of Puregon to rats induced no toxicologically significant effects. In \nrepeated-dose studies in rats (two weeks) and dogs (13 weeks) up to 100-fold the maximal human \ndose, Puregon induced no toxicologically significant effects. Puregon showed no mutagenic potential \nin the Ames test and in the in vitro chromosome aberration test with human lymphocytes.\n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection). \nClear and colourless solution.\nIn cartridges, designed to be used in conjunction with a pen injector.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nIn adult females:\nPuregon is indicated for the treatment of female infertility in the following clinical situations:\n Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS) in women who have been \n\nunresponsive to treatment with clomifene citrate.\n Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation to induce the development of multiple follicles in \n\nmedically assisted reproduction programs [e.g. in vitro fertilisation/embryo transfer (IVF/ET), \ngamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)].\n\nIn adult males:\n Deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Puregon should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of fertility problems.\n\nThe first injection with Puregon should be performed under direct medical supervision.\n\nPosology\n\nDosage in the female\nThere are great inter- and intra-individual variations in the response of the ovaries to exogenous \ngonadotrophins. This makes it impossible to set a uniform dosage scheme. The dosage should, \ntherefore, be adjusted individually depending on the ovarian response. This requires ultrasound \nassessment of follicular development. The concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may \nalso be useful.\nWhen using the pen-injector, it should be realised that the pen is a precision device which accurately \ndelivers the dose to which it is set. It was shown that on average an 18% higher amount of FSH is \ngiven with the pen compared with a conventional syringe. This may be of particular relevance when \nswitching between the pen-injector and a conventional syringe within one treatment cycle. Especially \nwhen switching from a syringe to the pen, small dose adjustments may be needed to prevent too high a \ndose being given.\nBased on the results of comparative clinical studies, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total\ndosage of Puregon over a shorter treatment period than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in \norder to optimise follicular development but also to reduce the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation (see section 5.1).\nClinical experience with Puregon is based on up to three treatment cycles in both indications. Overall \nexperience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first \nfour attempts and gradually declines thereafter.\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\n Anovulation\nA sequential treatment scheme is recommended starting with daily administration of 50 IU \nPuregon. The starting dose is maintained for at least seven days. If there is no ovarian response, \nthe daily dose is then gradually increased until follicle growth and/or plasma oestradiol levels \nindicate an adequate pharmacodynamic response. A daily increase of oestradiol levels of \n40-100% is considered to be optimal. The daily dose is then maintained until pre-ovulatory \nconditions are reached. Pre-ovulatory conditions are reached when there is ultrasonographic \nevidence of a dominant follicle of at least 18 mm in diameter and/or when plasma oestradiol \nlevels of 300-900 picograms/mL (1,000-3,000 pmol/L) are attained. Usually, 7 to 14 days of \ntreatment is sufficient to reach this state. The administration of Puregon is then discontinued and \novulation can be induced by administering human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). \nIf the number of responding follicles is too high or oestradiol levels increase too rapidly, i.e. \nmore than a daily doubling for oestradiol for two or three consecutive days, the daily dose \nshould be decreased. \nSince follicles of over 14 mm may lead to pregnancies, multiple pre-ovulatory follicles \nexceeding 14 mm carry the risk of multiple gestations. In that case hCG should be withheld and \npregnancy should be avoided to prevent multiple gestations.\n\n Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in medically assisted reproduction programs\nVarious stimulation protocols are applied. A starting dose of 100-225 IU is recommended for at\nleast the first four days. Thereafter, the dose may be adjusted individually, based upon ovarian \nresponse. In clinical studies it was shown that maintenance dosages ranging from 75-375 IU for \nsix to twelve days are sufficient, although longer treatment may be necessary.\nPuregon can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a \nGnRH agonist or antagonist. When using a GnRH agonist, a higher total treatment dose of \nPuregon may be required to achieve an adequate follicular response.\nOvarian response is monitored by ultrasound assessment. The concurrent determination of \nserum oestradiol levels may also be useful. When ultrasound assessment indicates the presence \nof at least three follicles of 16-20 mm, and there is evidence of a good oestradiol response \n(plasma levels of about 300-400 picograms/mL (1,000-1,300 pmol/L) for each follicle with a \ndiameter greater than 18 mm), the final phase of maturation of the follicles is induced by \nadministration of hCG. Oocyte retrieval is performed 34-35 hours later.\n\nDosage in the male\nPuregon should be given at a dosage of 450 IU/week, preferably divided in 3 dosages of 150 IU, \nconcomitantly with hCG. Treatment with Puregon and hCG should be continued for at least 3 to \n4 months before any improvement in spermatogenesis can be expected. To assess the response, semen \nanalysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment. If a patient has not responded \nafter this period, the combination therapy may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that \ntreatment for up to 18 months or longer may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of Puregon in the paediatric population for the approved indication.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nPuregon solution for injection in cartridges has been developed for use in the Puregon Pen and should \nbe administered subcutaneously. The injection site should be alternated to prevent lipoatrophy.\nUsing the pen, injection of Puregon can be carried out by the patient, provided that proper instructions \nare given by the physician.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nFor males and females\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Tumours of the ovary, breast, uterus, testis, pituitary or hypothalamus.\n Primary gonadal failure.\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nAdditionally for females\n Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.\n Ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries, not related to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\n Malformations of the reproductive organs incompatible with pregnancy.\n Fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAntibiotic hypersensitivity reactions\n Puregon may contain traces of streptomycin and/or neomycin. These antibiotics may cause \n\nhypersensitivity reactions in susceptible persons.\n\nInfertility evaluation before starting treatment\n Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate. In particular, \n\npatients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical insufficiency, \nhyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven.\n\nIn females\n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)\nOHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement. Clinical signs and \nsymptoms of mild and moderate OHSS are abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, mild to moderate \nenlargement of ovaries and ovarian cysts. Severe OHSS may be life-threatening. Clinical signs and \nsymptoms of severe OHSS are large ovarian cysts, acute abdominal pain, ascites, pleural effusion, \nhydrothorax, dyspnoea, oliguria, haematological abnormalities and weight gain. In rare instances, \nvenous or arterial thromboembolism may occur in association with OHSS. Transient liver function test \nabnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction with or without morphologic changes on liver biopsy \nhave also been reported in association with OHSS.\n\nOHSS may be caused by administration of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and by pregnancy \n(endogenous hCG). Early OHSS usually occurs within 10 days after hCG administration and may be \nassociated with an excessive ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation. Late OHSS occurs more \nthan 10 days after hCG administration, as a consequence of the hormonal changes with pregnancy. \nBecause of the risk of developing OHSS, patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after \nhCG administration.\n\nWomen with known risk factors for a high ovarian response may be especially prone to the \ndevelopment of OHSS during or following treatment with Puregon. For women having their first cycle \nof ovarian stimulation, for whom risk factors are only partially known, close observation for early \nsigns and symptoms of OHSS is recommended.\n\nFollow current clinical practice for reducing the risk of OHSS during Assisted Reproductive \nTechnology (ART). Adherence to the recommended Puregon dose and treatment regimen and careful \nmonitoring of ovarian response is important to reduce the risk of OHSS. To monitor the risk of OHSS, \nultrasonographic assessments of follicular development should be performed prior to treatment and at \nregular intervals during treatment; the concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may also be \nuseful. In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with 18 or more follicles of 11 mm or more in \ndiameter. \n\nIf OHSS develops, standard and appropriate management of OHSS should be implemented and \nfollowed.\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nMultiple Pregnancy\nMultiple pregnancies and births have been reported for all gonadotropin treatments, including \nPuregon. Multiple gestation, especially high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal \n(pregnancy and delivery complications) and perinatal (low birth weight) outcomes. For anovulatory \nwomen undergoing ovulation induction, monitoring follicular development with transvaginal \nultrasonography may aid in determining whether or not to continue the cycle in order to reduce the \nrisk of multiple pregnancies. The concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may also be \nuseful. The patients should be advised of the potential risks of multiple births before starting \ntreatment.\n\nIn women undergoing Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) procedures, the risk of a multiple \npregnancy is mainly related to the number of embryos transferred. When used for an ovulation \ninduction cycle, appropriate FSH dose adjustment(s) should prevent multiple follicle development.\n\nEctopic Pregnancy\nInfertile women undergoing ART have an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancies. Early \nultrasound confirmation that a pregnancy is intrauterine is therefore important.\n\nSpontaneous Abortion\nRates of pregnancy loss in women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques are higher than in the \nnormal population.\n\nVascular Complications\nThromboembolic events, both in association with and separate from OHSS, have been reported \nfollowing treatment with gonadotropins, including Puregon. Intravascular thrombosis, which may \noriginate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to vital organs or the \nextremities. In women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as a \npersonal or family history, severe obesity or thrombophilia, treatment with gonadotropins, including \nPuregon, may further increase this risk. In these women the benefits of gonadotropin administration,\nincluding Puregon, need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted, however, that pregnancy \nitself also carries an increased risk of thrombosis.\n\nCongenital Malformations\nThe incidence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple gestations.\n\nOvarian Torsion\nOvarian torsion has been reported after treatment with gonadotropins, including Puregon. Ovarian \ntorsion may be associated with other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal \nsurgery, past history of ovarian torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovaries. \nDamage to the ovary due to reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate \ndetorsion.\n\nOvarian and Other Reproductive System Neoplasms\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women.\n\nOther Medical Conditions\nMedical conditions that contraindicate pregnancy should also be evaluated before starting treatment \nwith Puregon.\n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nIn males\n\nPrimary Testicular Failure\nElevated endogenous FSH levels in men are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to Puregon/hCG therapy.\n\nBenzyl alcohol\nBenzyl alcohol may cause anaphylactoid reactions.\nLarge amounts of benzyl alcohol may cause metabolic acidosis. Special precautions should be taken \nwhen prescribing Puregon to pregnant or breast-feeding women and patients with liver or kidney \ndisease. \n\nSodium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nConcomitant use of Puregon and clomifene citrate may enhance the follicular response. After pituitary \ndesensitisation induced by a GnRH agonist, a higher dose of Puregon may be necessary to achieve an \nadequate follicular response.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nFertility\nPuregon is used in the treatment of women undergoing ovarian induction or controlled ovarian \nhyperstimulation in assisted reproduction programmes. In males Puregon is used in the treatment of \ndeficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. For posology and method of \nadministration, see section 4.2.\n\nPregnancy\nThe use of Puregon during pregnancy is not indicated. In case of inadvertent exposure during \npregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant FSH. \nHowever, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported. No teratogenic effect has been \nobserved in animal studies. \n\nBreast-feeding\nThere is no information available from clinical or animal studies on the excretion of follitropin beta in \nmilk. It is unlikely that follitropin beta is excreted in human milk due to its high molecular weight. If \nfollitropin beta would be excreted in human milk, it would be degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of \nthe child. Follitropin beta may affect milk production.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPuregon has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nClinical use of Puregon by the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes may lead to local reactions at the \nsite of injection (3% of all patients treated). The majority of these local reactions are mild and transient \nin nature. Generalised hypersensitivity reactions have been observed uncommonly (approximately\n0.2% of all patients treated with follitropin beta).\n\nTreatment of females:\nIn approximately 4% of the women treated with follitropin beta in clinical trials, signs and symptoms \nrelated to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) have been reported (see section 4.4). Adverse \n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\nreactions related to this syndrome include pelvic pain and/or congestion, abdominal pain and/or \ndistension, breast complaints and ovarian enlargement.\n\nThe table below lists the adverse reactions with follitropin beta reported in clinical trials in females, \naccording to system organ class and frequency; common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100).\n\nSOC Frequency Adverse reaction\nNervous system disorders Common Headache \nGastrointestinal disorders Common Abdominal distension \n\nAbdominal pain\nUncommon Abdominal discomfort\n\nConstipation\nDiarrhoea\nNausea\n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders\n\nCommon OHSS\nPelvic pain\n\nUncommon Breast complaints1\n\nMetrorrhagia\nOvarian cyst\nOvarian enlargement\nOvarian torsion\nUterine enlargement\nVaginal haemorrhage \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nCommon Injection site reaction2\n\nUncommon Generalised hypersensitivity \nreaction3\n\n1. Breast complaints include tenderness, pain and/or engorgement and nipple pain\n2. Local reactions at the site of injection include: bruising, pain, redness, swelling and itching\n3. Generalised hypersensitivity reaction include erythema, urticaria, rash and pruritus\n\nIn addition, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage and multiple gestations have been reported. These are \nconsidered to be related to ART or subsequent pregnancy.\n\nIn rare instances, thromboembolism has been associated with follitropin beta /hCG therapy as with \nother gonadotrophins.\n\nTreatment of males:\nThe table below lists the adverse reactions with follitropin beta reported in a clinical trial in males \n(30 patients dosed), according to system organ class and frequency; common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10).\n\nSOC Frequency1 Adverse reaction\nNervous system disorders Common Headache\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nCommon Acne\nRash\n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders\n\nCommon Epididymal cyst\nGynaecomastia\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nCommon Injection site reaction2\n\n1. Adverse reactions that are reported only once are listed as common because a single report raises the \nfrequency above 1%.\n\n2. Local reactions at the site of injection include induration and pain.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo data on acute toxicity of Puregon in humans is available, but the acute toxicity of Puregon and of \nurinary gonadotrophin preparations in animal studies has been shown to be very low. Too high a \ndosage of FSH may lead to hyperstimulation of the ovaries (see section 4.4).\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotrophins; \nATC code: G03G A06.\n\nPuregon contains a recombinant FSH. This is produced by recombinant DNA technology, using a \nChinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with the human FSH subunit genes. The primary amino \nacid sequence is identical to that of natural human FSH. Small differences in the carbohydrate chain \nstructure are known to exist.\n\nMechanism of Action\nFSH is indispensable in normal follicular growth and maturation, and gonadal steroid production. In \nthe female the level of FSH is critical for the onset and duration of follicular development, and \nconsequently for the timing and number of follicles reaching maturity. Puregon can thus be used to \nstimulate follicular development and steroid production in selected cases of disturbed gonadal \nfunction. Furthermore Puregon can be used to promote multiple follicular development in medically \nassisted reproduction programs [e.g. in vitro fertilisation/embryo transfer (IVF/ET), gamete intra-\nfallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]. Treatment with Puregon is \ngenerally followed by administration of hCG to induce the final phase of follicle maturation, \nresumption of meiosis and rupture of the follicle.\n\nClinical Efficacy and Safety\nIn clinical studies comparing recFSH (follitropin beta) and urinary FSH for controlled ovarian \nstimulation in women participating in an assisted reproduction technology (ART) program and for \novulation induction (see tables 1 and 2 below), Puregon was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of \na lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation.\n\nFor controlled ovarian stimulation, Puregon resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved at a lower \ntotal dose and with a shorter treatment period, when compared to urinary FSH.\n\nTable 1: Results of study 37,608 (randomized, group comparative clinical study comparing safety and \nefficacy of Puregon with urinary FSH in controlled ovarian stimulation).\n\nPuregon\n(n = 546)\n\nu-FSH\n(n = 361)\n\nMean no. of oocytes retrieved 10.84* 8.95\n\nMean total dose (no. of 75 IU ampoules) 28.5* 31.8\n\nMean duration of FSH stimulation (days) 10.7* 11.3\n\n* Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p0.05).\n\nFor ovulation induction, Puregon resulted in a lower median total dose and shorter median duration of \ntreatment when compared to urinary FSH.\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nTable 2: Results of study 37,609 (randomized, group comparative clinical study comparing safety and \nefficacy of Puregon with urinary FSH in ovulation induction).\n\nPuregon\n(n = 105)\n\nu-FSH\n(n = 66)\n\nMean no. of follicles  12 mm 3.6* 2.6\n\n 15 mm 2.0 1.7\n\n 18 mm 1.1 0.9\n\nMedian total dose (IU)\na 750* 1,035\n\nMedian duration of treatment (days)\na 10.0* 13.0\n\n* Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p0.05).\na\n\nRestricted to women with ovulation induced (Puregon, n = 76; u-FSH, n = 42).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nAfter subcutaneous administration of Puregon, maximum concentration of FSH is reached within \nabout 12 hours. Due to the sustained release from the injection site and the elimination half-life of \nabout 40 hours (ranging from 12 to 70 hours), FSH levels remain increased for 24-48 hours. Due to the \nrelatively long elimination half-life, repeated administration of the same dose will lead to plasma \nconcentrations of FSH that are approximately 1.5-2.5 times higher than after single-dose \nadministration. This increase enables therapeutic FSH concentrations to be reached.\nThe absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously administered Puregon is approximately 77%.\n\nDistribution, biotransformation and elimination\nRecombinant FSH is biochemically very similar to urinary human FSH and is distributed, \nmetabolised, and excreted in the same way.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSingle-dose administration of Puregon to rats induced no toxicologically significant effects. In \nrepeated-dose studies in rats (two weeks) and dogs (13 weeks) up to 100-fold the maximal human \ndose, Puregon induced no toxicologically significant effects. Puregon showed no mutagenic potential \nin the Ames test and in the in vitro chromosome aberration test with human lymphocytes.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Puregon is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Puregon\n3. How to use Puregon\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Puregon\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Puregon is and what it is used for\n\nPuregon solution for injection contains follitropin beta, a hormone known as follicle-stimulating \nhormone (FSH).\n\nFSH belongs to the group of gonadotrophins, which play an important role in human fertility and \nreproduction. In women, FSH is needed for the growth and development of follicles in the ovaries. \nFollicles are small round sacs that contain the egg cells. In men, FSH is needed for the production of \nsperm.\n\nPuregon is used to treat infertility in any of the following situations:\n\nWomen\nIn women who do not ovulate and do not respond to treatment with clomifene citrate, Puregon can be \nused to cause ovulation.\nIn women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other \nmethods, Puregon can bring about the development of multiple follicles.\n\nMen\nIn men who are infertile due to lowered hormone levels, Puregon can be used for the production of \nsperm.\n\n \n\n\n\n70\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Puregon\n\nDo not use Puregon\n\nIf you:\n are allergic to follitropin beta or any of the other ingredients of Puregon (listed in section 6)\n have a tumour of the ovary, breast, uterus, testis or brain (pituitary gland or hypothalamus)\n have heavy or irregular vaginal bleeding where the cause is unknown\n have ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian failure\n have ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries not caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\n have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible\n have fibroid tumours in the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible\n are a man and are infertile because of a condition called primary testicular failure.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor before using Puregon if you:\n have had an allergic reaction to certain antibiotics (neomycin and/or streptomycin)\n have uncontrolled pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems\n have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\n have adrenal glands that are not working properly (adrenocortical insufficiency)\n have high prolactin levels in the blood (hyperprolactinemia)\n have any other medical conditions (for example, diabetes, heart disease, or any other long-term \n\ndisease).\n\nIf you are a woman:\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nYour doctor will check the effects of the treatment regularly to be able to choose the correct dose of \nPuregon from day to day. You may regularly have ultrasound scans of the ovaries. Your doctor may \nalso check blood hormone levels. This is very important since too high a dose of FSH may lead to rare \nbut serious complications in which the ovaries are overly stimulated and the growing follicles become \nlarger than normal. This serious medical condition is called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome \n(OHSS). In rare cases, severe OHSS may be life-threatening. OHSS causes fluid to build-up suddenly \nin your stomach and chest areas and can cause blood clots to form. Call your doctor right away if you \nnotice severe abdominal swelling, pain in the stomach area (abdomen), feeling sick (nausea), \nvomiting, sudden weight gain due to fluid build-up, diarrhoea, decreased urine output or trouble \nbreathing (see also section 4 on Possible side effects).\n Regular monitoring of the response to FSH-treatment helps to prevent ovarian overstimulation. \nContact your doctor immediately if you are experiencing stomach pains, also if this occurs some days \nafter the last injection has been given.\n\nMultiple pregnancy or birth defects\nAfter treatment with gonadotrophin preparations, there is an increased chance of having multiple \npregnancies, even when only one embryo is transferred into the uterus. Multiple pregnancies carry an \nincreased health risk for both the mother and her babies around the time of birth. Furthermore, \nmultiple pregnancies and characteristics of the patients undergoing fertility treatment (e.g. age of the \nfemale, sperm characteristics, genetic background of both parents) may be associated with an \nincreased risk of birth defects. \n\nPregnancy complications\nThere is a slightly increased risk of a pregnancy outside the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy). Therefore, \nyour doctor should perform an early ultrasound examination to exclude the possibility of pregnancy \noutside the uterus.\nIn women undergoing fertility treatment there may be a slightly higher chance of a miscarriage.\n\n \n\n\n\n71\n\nBlood clot (Thrombosis)\nTreatment with Puregon, just as pregnancy itself, may increase the risk of having a blood clot \n(thrombosis). Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel.\n\nBlood clots can lead to serious medical conditions, such as: \n blockage in your lungs (pulmonary embolus)\n stroke\n heart attack\n blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)\n a lack of blood flow (deep venous thrombosis) that may result in a loss of your arm or leg.\n\nPlease discuss this with your doctor, before starting treatment, especially:\n if you already know you have an increased chance of having thrombosis\n if you, or anyone in your immediate family, have ever had a thrombosis\n if you are severely overweight.\n\nOvarian torsion\nOvarian torsion has occurred after treatment with gonadotropins including Puregon. Ovarian torsion is \nthe twisting of an ovary. Twisting of the ovary could cause the blood flow to the ovary to be cut off. \n\nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you:\n have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome OHSS\n are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant\n have ever had stomach (abdominal) surgery\n have ever had a twisting of an ovary\n have past or current cysts in your ovary or ovaries.\n\nOvarian and other reproductive system tumours\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who have had \ninfertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increases the risk of these \ntumours in infertile women.\n\nOther medical conditions\nIn addition, before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you:\n have been told by a doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you. \n\nIf you are a man:\n\nMen with too much FSH in their blood\nIncreased FSH blood levels are a sign of damage to the testicles. Puregon is usually not effective in \nsuch cases. To check the effects of treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen sample to be \nanalysed, four to six months after the start of treatment.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThere is no relevant use of Puregon in children and adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Puregon\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIf Puregon is used in a combination with clomifene citrate, the effect of Puregon may be increased. If a \nGnRH agonist (a medicine used to prevent early ovulation) has been given, higher doses of Puregon \nmay be needed.\n\n \n\n\n\n72\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. You should not use Puregon if \nyou are already pregnant, or think you might be pregnant.\n\nPuregon may affect milk production. It is unlikely that Puregon is passed into breast milk. If you are \nbreast-feeding, tell your doctor before using Puregon.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nPuregon is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nPuregon contains sodium\n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n3. How to use Puregon\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n\nDosage in women\n\nYour doctor will decide on your starting dose. This dose may be adjusted during your treatment \nperiod. Further details on the treatment schedule are given below.\nThere are large differences between women in the response of the ovaries to FSH, which makes it \nimpossible to set a dosage schedule which is suitable for all patients. To find the right dosage, your \ndoctor will check your follicle growth by means of ultrasound scanning, and measurement of the \namount of oestradiol (female sex hormone) in the blood.\n* Women who are not ovulating\n\nA starting dose is set by your doctor. This dose is continued for at least seven days. If there is no \novarian response, the daily dose will then be gradually increased until follicle growth and/or \nplasma oestradiol levels indicate a proper response. The daily dose is then maintained until a \nfollicle of proper size is present. Usually, 7 to 14 days of treatment are sufficient. Puregon \ntreatment is then stopped and ovulation will be induced by giving human chorionic \ngonadotrophin (hCG).\n\n* Medically assisted reproduction programs, for instance IVF\nA starting dose is set by your doctor. This dose is continued for at least the first four days. After \nthis, your dose may be adjusted, based upon your ovarian response. When a sufficient number \nof follicles of proper size are present, the final phase of maturation of the follicles is induced by \ngiving hCG. Retrieval of the egg(s) is performed 34-35 hours later.\n\nDosage in men\n\nPuregon is usually prescribed at a dose of 450 IU per week, mostly in 3 dosages of 150 IU, in \ncombination with another hormone (hCG), for at least 3 to 4 months. The treatment period equals the \ndevelopment time of sperm and the time in which improvement can be expected. If your sperm \nproduction has not started after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.\n\nHow are the injections given\n\nThe very first injection of Puregon should only be given in the presence of a doctor or nurse. \nInjections may be given slowly into a muscle (for instance in the buttock, upper leg or upper arm) or \nunder the skin (in the lower stomach, for example).\nWhen given into a muscle the injection should be given by the doctor or nurse.\n\n \n\n\n\n73\n\nWhen given under the skin the injection may, in some cases, be given by yourself or your partner. \nYour doctor will tell you when and how to do this. If you inject yourself with Puregon, follow the \ninstructions for use in the next section, to give Puregon properly and with minimal discomfort.\n\nInstructions for use\n\nStep 1 - Preparing the syringe \nYou should use sterile disposable syringes and needles for the administration of Puregon. The volume \nof the syringe should be small enough so that the prescribed dose can be given with reasonable \naccuracy. \nPuregon solution for injection comes in a glass vial. Do not use the solution if it contains particles or is \nnot clear. First, you should remove the flip-off cap of the vial. Place a needle on a syringe and pierce \nthe needle through the rubber stopper of the vial (a). Draw the solution up into the syringe (b), and \nreplace the needle with an injection needle (c). Finally hold the syringe with the needle pointing \nupwards and gently tap the side to force any air bubbles up to the top; then squeeze the plunger until \nall the air has been expelled, and only Puregon solution is left in the syringe (d). If necessary, the \nplunger may be squeezed further, to adjust the volume to be administered.\n\nStep 2 - The injection site\nThe best site for an injection under the skin is in the lower stomach around the navel (e) where there is \na lot of loose skin and layers of fatty tissue. You should vary the injection site a little with each \ninjection. \nIt is possible to inject in other areas. Your doctor or nurse will tell you where to inject.\n\nStep 3 - Preparing the area\nA few taps at the injection site will stimulate tiny nerve endings and help reduce discomfort when the \nneedle goes in. Wash your hands and swab the injection site with disinfectant (for example \nchlorohexidine 0.5%) to remove any surface bacteria. Clean about two inches around the point where \nthe needle will go in and let the disinfectant dry for at least one minute before you proceed.\n\nStep 4 - Inserting the needle\nPinch the skin a little. With the other hand, insert the needle at an angle of 90 degrees into the skin’s \nsurface, as shown in the picture (f).\n\nStep 5 - Checking the correct needle position\nIf the needle position is correct the plunger should be quite difficult to draw back. Any blood sucked \nback into the syringe means that the needle tip has penetrated a vein or artery. If this happens pull out \nthe syringe, cover the injection site with a swab containing disinfectant and apply pressure; the site \n\n \n\n\n\n74\n\nwill stop bleeding in a minute or two. Do not use this solution. Start again with Step 1 using a new \nsyringe, new needles and a new vial of Puregon.\n\nStep 6 - Injecting the solution\nDepress the plunger slowly and steadily, so the solution is correctly injected and the skin tissues are \nnot damaged.\n\nStep 7 - Removing the syringe\nPull the syringe out quickly and apply pressure to the injection site with a swab containing \ndisinfectant. A gentle massage of the site - while still maintaining pressure - helps disperse the \nPuregon solution and relieve any discomfort.\n\nAny remaining solution should be discarded.\nDo not mix Puregon with any other medicines.\n\nIf you use more Puregon than you should\n\nTell your doctor immediately.\nToo high a dose of Puregon may cause hyperstimulation of the ovaries (OHSS). This may be noticed \nas pain in the stomach. If you are troubled by stomach pains, tell your doctor immediately. See also \nsection 4 on possible side effects.\n\nIf you forget to use Puregon\n\nIf you forget a dose do not use a double dose to make up for a missed dose.\n Contact your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nSerious side effects in women\nA complication with FSH treatment is hyperstimulation of the ovaries. Ovarian overstimulation may \ndevelop into a medical condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can be \na serious medical problem. The risk can be reduced by careful monitoring of follicular development \nduring treatment. Your doctor will do ultrasound scans of your ovaries to carefully monitor the \nnumber of maturing follicles. Your doctor may also check blood hormone levels. Pain in the stomach, \nfeeling sick or diarrhoea are the first symptoms. In more severe cases symptoms may include \nenlargement of the ovaries, accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and/or chest (which may cause \nsudden weight gain due to fluid buildup) and the occurrence of blood clots in the circulation. See \nwarnings and precautions in section 2.\n Contact your doctor immediately if you are experiencing stomach pains, or any of the other \nsymptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation, also if this occurs some days after the last injection.\n\nIf you are a woman:\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n- Headache\n- Injection site reactions (such as bruising, pain, redness, swelling and itching)\n- Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n- Pelvic pain\n- Stomach pain and/or bloating\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n- Breast complaints (including tenderness)\n\n \n\n\n\n75\n\n- Diarrhoea, constipation or stomach discomfort\n- Enlargement of the uterus\n- Feeling sick\n- Hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, redness, hives and itching)\n- Ovarian cysts or enlargement of the ovaries\n- Ovarian torsion (twisting of the ovaries)\n- Vaginal bleeding\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):\n- Blood clots (this may also occur in the absence of unwanted overstimulation of the ovaries, see \n\nwarnings and precautions in section 2)\n\nPregnancy outside the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy), miscarriage and multiple pregnancies have also \nbeen reported. These side effects are not considered to be related to the use of Puregon, but to Assisted \nReproductive Technology (ART) or subsequent pregnancy.\n\nIf you are a man:\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n- Acne\n- Injection site reactions (such as hardening and pain)\n- Headache\n- Rash\n- Some breast development\n- Testicular cyst\n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.

What you need to know before you use Puregon\n3. How to use Puregon\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Puregon\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Puregon is and what it is used for\n\nPuregon solution for injection contains follitropin beta, a hormone known as follicle-stimulating \nhormone (FSH).\n\nFSH belongs to the group of gonadotrophins, which play an important role in human fertility and \nreproduction. In women, FSH is needed for the growth and development of follicles in the ovaries. \nFollicles are small round sacs that contain the egg cells. In men, FSH is needed for the production of \nsperm. \n\nPuregon is used to treat infertility in any of the following situations:\n\nWomen\nIn women who do not ovulate and do not respond to treatment with clomifene citrate, Puregon can be \nused to cause ovulation. \nIn women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and other \nmethods, Puregon can bring about the development of multiple follicles. \n\nMen\nIn men who are infertile due to lowered hormone levels, Puregon can be used for the production of \nsperm. \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Puregon\n\nDo not use Puregon\n\nIf you:\n are allergic to follitropin beta or any of the other ingredients of Puregon (listed in section 6)\n have a tumour of the ovary, breast, uterus, testis or brain (pituitary gland or hypothalamus)\n\n \n\n\n\n80\n\n have heavy or irregular vaginal bleeding where the cause is unknown\n have ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian failure\n have ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries not caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\n have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible\n have fibroid tumours in the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible\n are a man and are infertile because of a condition called primary testicular failure.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor before using Puregon if you:\n have had an allergic reaction to certain antibiotics (neomycin and/or streptomycin)\n have uncontrolled pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems\n have an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\n have adrenal glands that are not working properly (adrenocortical insufficiency)\n have high prolactin levels in the blood (hyperprolactinemia)\n have any other medical conditions (for example, diabetes, heart disease, or any other long-term \n\ndisease).\n\nIf you are a woman:\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nYour doctor will check the effects of the treatment regularly to be able to choose the correct dose of \nPuregon from day to day. You may regularly have ultrasound scans of the ovaries. Your doctor may \nalso check blood hormone levels. This is very important since too high a dose of FSH may lead to rare \nbut serious complications in which the ovaries are overly stimulated and the growing follicles become \nlarger than normal. This serious medical condition is called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome \n(OHSS). In rare cases, severe OHSS may be life-threatening. OHSS causes fluid to build-up suddenly \nin your stomach and chest areas and can cause blood clots to form. Call your doctor right away if you \nnotice severe abdominal swelling, pain in the stomach area (abdomen), feeling sick (nausea), \nvomiting, sudden weight gain due to fluid build-up, diarrhoea, decreased urine output or trouble \nbreathing (see also section 4 on Possible side effects).\n Regular monitoring of the response to FSH-treatment helps to prevent ovarian overstimulation. \nContact your doctor immediately if you are experiencing stomach pains, also if this occurs some days \nafter the last injection has been given.\n\nMultiple pregnancy or birth defects\nAfter treatment with gonadotrophin preparations, there is an increased chance of having multiple \npregnancies, even when only one embryo is transferred into the uterus. Multiple pregnancies carry an \nincreased health risk for both the mother and her babies around the time of birth. Furthermore, \nmultiple pregnancies and characteristics of the patients undergoing fertility treatment (e.g. age of the \nfemale, sperm characteristics, genetic background of both parents) may be associated with an \nincreased risk of birth defects. \n\nPregnancy complications\nThere is a slightly increased risk of a pregnancy outside the uterus (an ectopic pregnancy). Therefore, \nyour doctor should perform an early ultrasound examination to exclude the possibility of pregnancy \noutside the uterus.\nIn women undergoing fertility treatment there may be a slightly higher chance of a miscarriage.\n\nBlood clot (Thrombosis)\nTreatment with Puregon, just as pregnancy itself, may increase the risk of having a blood clot \n(thrombosis). Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel.\n\nBlood clots can lead to serious medical conditions, such as: \n blockage in your lungs (pulmonary embolus)\n stroke\n\n \n\n\n\n81\n\n heart attack\n blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)\n a lack of blood flow (deep venous thrombosis) that may result in a loss of your arm or leg.\n\nPlease discuss this with your doctor, before starting treatment, especially:\n if you already know you have an increased chance of having thrombosis\n if you, or anyone in your immediate family, have ever had a thrombosis\n if you are severely overweight.\n\nOvarian torsion\nOvarian torsion has occurred after treatment with gonadotropins including Puregon. Ovarian torsion is \nthe twisting of an ovary. Twisting of the ovary could cause the blood flow to the ovary to be cut off. \n\nBefore starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you:\n have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome OHSS\n are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant\n have ever had stomach (abdominal) surgery\n have ever had a twisting of an ovary\n have past or current cysts in your ovary or ovaries.\n\nOvarian and other reproductive system tumours\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who have had \ninfertility treatment. It is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increases the risk of these \ntumours in infertile women.\n\nOther medical conditions\nIn addition, before starting to use this medicine, tell your doctor if you:\n have been told by a doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you. \n\nIf you are a man:\n\nMen with too much FSH in their blood\nIncreased FSH blood levels are a sign of damage to the testicles. Puregon is usually not effective in \nsuch cases. To check the effects of treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen sample to be \nanalysed, four to six months after the start of treatment.\n\nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no relevant use of Puregon in children and adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Puregon\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIf Puregon is used in a combination with clomifene citrate, the effect of Puregon may be increased. If a \nGnRH agonist (a medicine used to prevent early ovulation) has been given, higher doses of Puregon \nmay be needed.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. You should not use Puregon if \nyou are already pregnant, or think you might be pregnant.\n\nPuregon may affect milk production. It is unlikely that Puregon is passed into breast milk. If you are \nbreast-feeding, tell your doctor before using Puregon.\n\n \n\n\n\n82\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nPuregon is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nPuregon contains benzyl alcohol\n\nThis medicinal product contains 10 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL.\nBenzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large \namounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called “metabolic \nacidosis”).\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. This is because large \namounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called “metabolic \nacidosis”).\n\nPuregon contains sodium\n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n3. How to use Puregon\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n\nDosage in women\n\nYour doctor will decide on your starting dose. This dose may be adjusted during your treatment \nperiod. Further details on the treatment schedule are given below. \nThere are large differences between women in the response of the ovaries to FSH, which makes it \nimpossible to set a dosage schedule which is suitable for all patients. To find the right dosage, your \ndoctor will check your follicle growth by means of ultrasound scanning, and measurement of the \namount of oestradiol (female sex hormone) in the blood.\n* Women who are not ovulating\n\nA starting dose is set by your doctor. This dose is continued for at least seven days. If there is no \novarian response, the daily dose will then be gradually increased until follicle growth and/or \nplasma oestradiol levels indicate a proper response. The daily dose is then maintained until a \nfollicle of proper size is present. Usually, 7 to 14 days of treatment are sufficient. Puregon \ntreatment is then stopped and ovulation will be induced by giving human chorionic \ngonadotrophin (hCG). \n\n* Medically assisted reproduction programs, for instance IVF\nA starting dose is set by your doctor. This dose is continued for at least the first four days. After \nthis, your dose may be adjusted, based upon your ovarian response. When a sufficient number of \nfollicles of proper size are present, the final phase of maturation of the follicles is induced by \ngiving hCG. Retrieval of the egg(s) is performed 34-35 hours later. \n\nDosage in men\n\nPuregon is usually prescribed at a dose of 450 IU per week, mostly in 3 dosages of 150 IU, in \ncombination with another hormone (hCG), for at least 3 to 4 months. The treatment period equals the \ndevelopment time of sperm and the time in which improvement can be expected. If your sperm \nproduction has not started after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months. \n\n \n\n\n\n83\n\nHow are the injections given\n\nPuregon solution for injection in cartridges has been developed for use in the Puregon Pen. The \nseparate instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully. Do not use the cartridge if the \nsolution contains particles or if the solution is not clear. \nUsing the pen, injections just under the skin (in the lower stomach, for example) can be given by \nyourself or your partner. Your doctor will tell you when and how to do this. If you inject yourself with \nPuregon, follow the instructions carefully to give Puregon properly and with minimal discomfort. \nThe very first injection of Puregon should only be given in the presence of a doctor or nurse. \n\nIf you use more Puregon than you should\n\nTell your doctor immediately.\nToo high a dose of Puregon may cause hyperstimulation of the ovaries (OHSS). This may be noticed \nas pain in the stomach. If you are troubled by stomach pains, tell your doctor immediately. See also\nsection 4 on possible side effects. \n\nIf you forget to use Puregon \n\nIf you forget a dose do not use a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \n Contact your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.\n\n4.
