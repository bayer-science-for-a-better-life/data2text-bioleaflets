This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nLUSDUNA 100 units/mL solution for injection in a pre-filled pen\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach mL contains 100 units insulin glargine* (equivalent to 3.64 mg).\n\nEach pen contains 3 mL of solution for injection, equivalent to 300 units.\n\n*Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection). Nexvue.\nClear, colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nLUSDUNA contains insulin glargine, an insulin analogue, and has a prolonged duration of action.\nLUSDUNA should be administered once daily at any time but at the same time each day.\n\nThe dose regimen (dose and timing) should be individually adjusted. In patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus, LUSDUNA can also be given together with oral antidiabetic medicinal products.\n\nThe potency of this medicinal product is stated in units. These units are exclusive to insulin glargine \nand are not the same as IU or the units used to express the potency of other insulin analogues (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly population (≥ 65 years old)\nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity \nfor gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.\n\nPaediatric population\nSafety and efficacy of insulin glargine have been established in adolescents and children aged 2 years \nand older. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nSafety and efficacy of insulin glargine have not been established in children below the age of 2 years. \nNo data are available.\n\nSwitch from other insulins to LUSDUNA\n\nWhen changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin to a regimen \nwith LUSDUNA, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the concomitant \nantidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted (dose and timing of additional regular insulins or \nfast-acting insulin analogues or the dose of oral antidiabetic medicinal products).\n\nSwitch from twice daily NPH insulin to LUSDUNA\n\nTo reduce the risk of nocturnal and early morning hypoglycaemia, patients who are changing their \nbasal insulin regimen from a twice daily NPH insulin to a once daily regimen with LUSDUNA should \nreduce their daily dose of basal insulin by 20-30 % during the first weeks of treatment.\n\nSwitch from insulin glargine 300 units/mL to LUSDUNA\n\nLUSDUNA and medicinal products containing insulin glargine 300 units/mL are not bioequivalent \nand are not directly interchangeable. To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, patients who are changing \ntheir basal insulin regimen from an insulin regimen with once daily insulin glargine 300 units/mL to a \nonce daily regimen with LUSDUNA should reduce their dose by approximately 20%.\n\nDuring the first weeks the reduction should, at least partially, be compensated by an increase in \nmealtime insulin, after this period the regimen should be adjusted individually.\n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the switch and in the initial weeks thereafter.\n\nWith improved metabolic control and resulting increase in insulin sensitivity a further adjustment in \ndose regimen may become necessary. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if the \npatient’s weight or life-style changes, change of timing of insulin dose or other circumstances arise \nthat increase susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients with high insulin doses because of antibodies to human insulin may experience an improved \ninsulin response with LUSDUNA.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nLUSDUNA is only suitable for subcutaneous injections via a disposable pen. If administration by \nsyringe is necessary, another insulin glargine product available in a vial should be used.\n\nLUSDUNA should not be administered intravenously. The prolonged duration of action of insulin \nglargine is dependent on its injection into subcutaneous tissue. Intravenous administration of the usual \nsubcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycaemia.\n\nThere are no clinically relevant differences in serum insulin or glucose levels after abdominal, deltoid \nor thigh administration of insulin glargine. Injection sites must be rotated within a given injection area \nfrom one injection to the next to prevent injection site reactions (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\nLUSDUNA must not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted. Mixing or diluting can change its \ntime/action profile and mixing can cause precipitation.\n\nBefore using Nexvue, the instructions for use included in the pack must be read carefully (see \nsection 6.6).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nLUSDUNA is not the insulin of choice for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Instead, regular \ninsulin administered intravenously is recommended in such cases.\n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient’s \nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered.\n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \nfor a change in dose.\n\nHypoglycaemia\n\nThe time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, \ntherefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. Due to more sustained basal insulin supply \nwith insulin glargine, less nocturnal but more early morning hypoglycaemia can be expected.\n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \nhypoglycaemia).\n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients:\n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved,\n- who have experienced recurrent and/or recent events of hypoglycaemia,\n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually,\n- who are elderly,\n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin,\n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present,\n- with a long history of diabetes,\n- suffering from a psychiatric illness,\n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5).\n\nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \npatient’s awareness of hypoglycaemia.\n\nThe prolonged effect of subcutaneous insulin glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycaemia.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered.\n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness \nof hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the \nsusceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose \nadjustment. These include:\n\n- change in the injection area,\n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g., by removal of stress factors),\n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity,\n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea),\n- inadequate food intake,\n- missed meals,\n- alcohol consumption,\n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders, (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency),\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5).\n\nIntercurrent illness\n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases urine tests for ketones are \nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \nand they must never omit insulin entirely.\n\nInsulin antibodies formation\n\nInsulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin\nantibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or\nhypoglycaemia (see section 5.1).\n\nMedication errors\n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have \nbeen accidentally administered instead of insulin glargine. Insulin label must always be checked \nbefore each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin glargine and other insulins.\n\nCombination of LUSDUNA with pioglitazone\n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and LUSDUNA is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.\n\nExcipients\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e., essentially \n“sodium-free”.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin \nglargine.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \npropoxyphene, salicylates, somatostatin analogues and sulphonamide antibiotics.\n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazine derivatives,\nsomatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, \nterbutaline), thyroid hormones, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. clozapine and \nolanzapine) and protease inhibitors.\n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.\n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nFor insulin glargine no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are \navailable. A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate \nno specific adverse effects of insulin glargine on pregnancy and no specific malformative nor \nfoeto/neonatal toxicity of insulin glargine. Animal data do not indicate reproductive toxicity.\n\nThe use of LUSDUNA may be considered during pregnancy, if clinically needed.\n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \nthroughout pregnancy to prevent adverse outcomes associated with hyperglycaemia. Insulin \nrequirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and \nthird trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of \nhypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether insulin glargine is excreted in human milk. No metabolic effects of ingested \ninsulin glargine on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since insulin glargine as a peptide is \ndigested into amino acids in the human gastrointestinal tract.\n\nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.\n\nFertility\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines).\n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nHypoglycaemia (very common), in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may \noccur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred \nterm by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common: \n≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; very rare: \n< 1/10,000).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nMedDRA \nsystem organ \n\nclasses \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare\n\nImmune system disorders\nAllergic \nreactions\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nHypoglycaemia\n\nNervous system disorders\nDysgeusia\n\nEye disorders\nVisual \n\nimpairment\n\nRetinopathy\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nLipohypertrophy Lipoatrophy\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\n\nMyalgia\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nInjection site \nreactions\n\nOedema\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or \nsevere hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.\n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms (see section 4.4).\n\nImmune system disorders\nImmediate-type allergic reactions to insulin are rare. Such reactions to insulin (including insulin \nglargine) or the excipients may, for example, be associated with generalised skin reactions, \nangio-oedema, bronchospasm, hypotension and shock, and may be life-threatening.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8\n\nEyes disorders\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens.\n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. In patients with proliferative retinopathy, \nparticularly if not treated with photocoagulation, severe hypoglycaemic episodes may result in \ntransient amaurosis.\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nLipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation \nof the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions.\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nInjection site reactions include redness, pain, itching, hives, swelling, or inflammation. Most minor \nreactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.\n\nRarely, insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema particularly if previously poor metabolic \ncontrol is improved by intensified insulin therapy.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn general, the safety profile for children and adolescents (≤ 18 years of age) is similar to the safety \nprofile for adults.\nThe adverse reaction reports received from post marketing surveillance included relatively more \nfrequent injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions (rash, \nurticaria) in children and adolescents (≤ 18 years of age) than in adults.\nClinical study safety data are not available for children under 2 years.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia.\n\nManagement\n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nof the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed.\n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \nrecovery.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting. \nATC Code: A10AE04.\n\nLUSDUNA is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nInsulin glargine is a human insulin analogue designed to have a low solubility at neutral pH. It is \ncompletely soluble at the acidic pH of the LUSDUNA injection solution (pH 4). After injection into \nthe subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralised leading to formation of micro-precipitates \nfrom which small amounts of insulin glargine are continuously released, providing a smooth, peakless, \npredictable concentration/time profile with a prolonged duration of action.\n\nInsulin glargine is metabolised into 2 active metabolites M1 and M2 (see section 5.2).\n\nInsulin receptor binding: In vitro studies indicate that the affinity of insulin glargine and its \nmetabolites M1 and M2 for the human insulin receptor is similar to the one of human insulin.\n\nIGF-1 receptor binding: The affinity of insulin glargine for the human IGF-1 receptor is approximately \n5 to 8-fold greater than that of human insulin (but approximately 70 to 80-fold lower than the one of \nIGF-1), whereas M1 and M2 bind the IGF-1 receptor with slightly lower affinity compared to human \ninsulin.\n\nThe total therapeutic insulin concentration (insulin glargine and its metabolites) found in type 1 \ndiabetic patients was markedly lower than what would be required for a half maximal occupation of \nthe IGF-1 receptor and the subsequent activation of the mitogenic-proliferative pathway initiated by \nthe IGF-1 receptor. Physiological concentrations of endogenous IGF-1 may activate the \nmitogenic-proliferative pathway; however, the therapeutic concentrations found in insulin therapy, \nincluding in LUSDUNA therapy, are considerably lower than the pharmacological concentrations \nrequired to activate the IGF-1 pathway.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nThe primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin \nand its analogues lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by \nskeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the \nadipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.\n\nIn clinical pharmacology studies, intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin have been shown to \nbe equipotent when given at the same doses. As with all insulins, the time course of action of insulin \nglargine may be affected by physical activity and other variables.\n\nIn euglycaemic clamp studies in healthy subjects or in patients with type 1 diabetes, the onset of action \nof subcutaneous insulin glargine was slower than with human NPH insulin, its effect profile was \nsmooth and peakless, and the duration of its effect was prolonged.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe following graph shows the results from a study in patients:\n\nFigure 1: Activity Profile in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes\n\n*determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels (hourly mean \nvalues)\n\nThe longer duration of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is directly related to its slower rate of \nabsorption and supports once daily administration. The time course of action of insulin and insulin \nanalogues such as insulin glargine may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same \nindividual.\n\nIn a clinical study, symptoms of hypoglycaemia or counter-regulatory hormone responses were similar \nafter intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin both in healthy volunteers and patients with \ntype 1 diabetes.\n\nIn clinical studies, antibodies that cross-react with human insulin and insulin glargine were observed\nwith the same frequency in both NPH-insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nEffects of insulin glargine (once daily) on diabetic retinopathy were evaluated in an open-label 5 year \nNPH-controlled study (NPH given bid) in 1024 type 2 diabetic patients in which progression of \nretinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale was \ninvestigated by fundus photography. No significant difference was seen in the progression of diabetic \nretinopathy when insulin glargine was compared to NPH insulin.\n\nThe ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine INtervention) study was a multicentre, \nrandomised, 2x2 factorial design study conducted in 12,537 participants at high cardiovascular (CV) \nrisk with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (12 % of participants) or \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus treated with ≤ 1 antidiabetic oral agent (88 % of participants). Participants \nwere randomized (1:1) to receive insulin glargine (n=6,264), titrated to reach FPG ≤ 95 mg/dL \n(5.3 mM), or standard care (n=6,273).\nThe first co-primary efficacy outcome was the time to the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke, and the second co-primary efficacy outcome was the \n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0 10 20 30\n\nG\nlu\n\nco\nse\n\n U\nti\n\nli\nza\n\nti\non\n\n \n\nR\nat\n\ne*\n (\n\nm\ng\n\n/k\ng/\n\nm\nin\n\n)\n\nTime (h) after s.c. injection\n\nInsulin glargine\n\nNPH insulin\n\nEnd of observation\nperiod\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11\n\ntime to the first occurrence of any of the first co-primary events, or revascularisation procedure \n(coronary, carotid, or peripheral), or hospitalisation for heart failure.\n\nSecondary endpoints included all-cause mortality and a composite microvascular outcome.\n\nInsulin glargine did not alter the relative risk for CV disease and CV mortality when compared to \nstandard of care. There were no differences between insulin glargine and standard care for the two \nco-primary outcomes; for any component endpoint comprising these outcomes; for all-cause mortality; \nor for the composite microvascular outcome.\n\nMean dose of insulin glargine by study end was 0.42 U/kg. At baseline, participants had a median \nHbA1c value of 6.4 % and median on-treatment HbA1c values ranged from 5.9 to 6.4 % in the insulin \nglargine group, and 6.2 % to 6.6 % in the standard care group throughout the duration of follow-up. \nThe rates of severe hypoglycaemia (affected participants per 100 participant years of exposure) were \n1.05 for insulin glargine and 0.30 for standard care group and the rates of confirmed non-severe \nhypoglycaemia were 7.71 for insulin glargine and 2.44 for standard care group. Over the course of this \n6-year study, 42 % of the insulin glargine group did not experience any hypoglycaemia.\n\nAt the last on-treatment visit, there was a mean increase in body weight from baseline of 1.4 kg in the \ninsulin glargine group and a mean decrease of 0.8 kg in the standard care group.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn a randomised, controlled clinical study, paediatric patients (age range 6 to 15 years) with type 1 \ndiabetes (n=349) were treated for 28 weeks with a basal-bolus insulin regimen where regular human \ninsulin was used before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH \nhuman insulin was administered once or twice daily. Similar effects on glycohaemoglobin and the \nincidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia were observed in both treatment groups, however fasting \nplasma glucose decreased more from baseline in the insulin glargine group than in the NPH group. \nThere was less severe hypoglycaemia in the insulin glargine group as well. One hundred forty three of \nthe patients treated with insulin glargine in this study continued treatment with insulin glargine in an \nuncontrolled extension study with mean duration of follow-up of 2 years. No new safety signals were \nseen during this extended treatment with insulin glargine.\n\nA crossover study comparing insulin glargine plus lispro insulin to NPH plus regular human insulin \n(each treatment administered for 16 weeks in random order) in 26 adolescent type 1 diabetic patients \naged 12 to 18 years was also performed. As in the paediatric study described above, fasting plasma \nglucose reduction from baseline was greater in the insulin glargine group than in the NPH group. \nHbA1c changes from baseline were similar between treatment groups; however blood glucose values \nrecorded overnight were significantly higher in the insulin glargine/ lispro group than the NPH/regular \ngroup, with a mean nadir of 5.4 mM versus 4.1 mM. Correspondingly, the incidences of nocturnal \nhypoglycaemia were 32 % in the insulin glargine / lispro group versus 52 % in the NPH / regular \ngroup.\n\nA 24-week parallel group study was conducted in 125 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 2 to \n6 years, comparing insulin glargine given once daily in the morning to NPH insulin given once or \ntwice daily as basal insulin. Both groups received bolus insulin before meals.\nThe primary aim of demonstrating non-inferiority of insulin glargine to NPH in all hypoglycaemia was \nnot met and there was a trend to an increase of hypoglycaemic events with insulin glargine [insulin \nglargine: NPH rate ratio (95 % CI) = 1.18 (0.97-1.44)]. Glycohaemoglobin and glucose variabilities \nwere comparable in both treatment groups. No new safety signals were observed in this study.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nIn healthy subjects and diabetic patients, insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower and much \nmore prolonged absorption and showed a lack of a peak after subcutaneous injection of insulin \nglargine in comparison to human NPH insulin. Concentrations were thus consistent with the time \nprofile of the pharmacodynamic activity of insulin glargine. Figure 1 above shows the activity profiles \nover time of insulin glargine and NPH insulin.\n\nInsulin glargine injected once daily will reach steady state levels in 2-4 days after the first dose.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nAfter subcutaneous injection in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is rapidly metabolised at the \ncarboxyl terminus of the Beta chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) \nand M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). In plasma, the principal circulating compound is the \nmetabolite M1. The exposure to M1 increases with the administered dose of insulin glargine.\n\nThe pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic findings indicate that the effect of the subcutaneous \ninjection with insulin glargine is principally based on exposure to M1. Insulin glargine and the \nmetabolite M2 were not detectable in the vast majority of subjects and, when they were detectable \ntheir concentration was independent of the administered dose of insulin glargine.\n\nElimination\n\nWhen given intravenously the elimination half-life of insulin glargine and human insulin were \ncomparable.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nIn clinical studies, subgroup analyses based on age and gender did not indicate any difference in safety \nand efficacy in insulin glargine-treated patients compared to the entire study population.\n\nPaediatric population\nPharmacokinetics in children aged 2 to less than 6 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus was assessed in \none clinical study (see section 5.1). Plasma “trough” levels of insulin glargine and its main M1 and \nM2 metabolites were measured in children treated with insulin glargine, revealing plasma \nconcentration patterns similar to adults, and providing no evidence for accumulation of insulin \nglargine or its metabolites with chronic dosing.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully including the LUSDUNA Nexvue pre-filled pen Instructions for \nUse, before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What LUSDUNA is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use LUSDUNA\n3. How to use LUSDUNA\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store LUSDUNA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What LUSDUNA is and what it is used for\n\nLUSDUNA contains insulin glargine. This is a modified insulin, very similar to human insulin.\n\nLUSDUNA is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and \nabove.\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of \nblood sugar. Insulin glargine has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use LUSDUNA\n\nDo not use LUSDUNA\n- If you are allergic to insulin glargine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nLUSDUNA is only suitable for injection just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject \nyour insulin by another method.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using LUSDUNA.\nFollow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical \nactivity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor.\n\nIf your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see section\n“Hyperglycaemia and Hypoglycaemia” at the end of this leaflet).\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31\n\nTravel\nBefore travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about:\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, syringes etc.,\n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.\n\nIllnesses and injuries\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, \nadjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests):\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).\nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.\n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you \nrequire insulin.\n\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose.\n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone (oral anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus) and \ninsulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you \nexperience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or \nlocalised swelling (oedema).\n\nChildren\nThere is no experience with the use of LUSDUNA in children below the age of 2 years.\n\nOther medicines and LUSDUNA\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what \naction, if any, you need to take.\n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as acetylsalicylic acid, used to relieve pain and \n\nlower fever), \n- somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, used to treat an uncommon condition in which you \n\nmake too much growth hormone), \n- sulphonamide antibiotics.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n32\n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat low blood sugar), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n- thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV).\n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).\n\nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.\n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia.\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nLUSDUNA with alcohol \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.\n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \nyour diet.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels),\n- you have problems with your sight. \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of LUSDUNA\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33\n\n3. How to use LUSDUNA\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.\n\nLUSDUNA is only suitable for injection just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject \nyour insulin by another method.\n\nSwitching insulins\nAlthough LUSDUNA contains the same active substance as other medicines containing insulin \nglargine 300 units/ml, these medicines are not interchangeable. The switch from one insulin therapy to \nanother requires medical prescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. Please, \nconsult your doctor for further information.\n\nDose\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin \nusage, your doctor will\n\n- determine how much LUSDUNA per day you will need and at what time, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of LUSDUNA. \n\nLUSDUNA is a long-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a \nshort-acting insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are \nable to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high \nor too low. See section “Hyperglycaemia and Hypoglycaemia” at the end of this leaflet.\n\nUse in children and adolescents\nLUSDUNA can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. Use this medicine exactly \nas your doctor has told you.\n\nFrequency of administration \nYou need one injection of LUSDUNA every day, at the same time of the day. The Nexvue pen\ndelivers LUSDUNA in increments of 1 unit up to a maximum single dose of 60 units. The pen \ncontains a total of 300 units.\n\nMethod of administration\nLUSDUNA is injected under the skin. Do not inject LUSDUNA in a vein, since this will change its \naction and may cause hypoglycaemia.\n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject LUSDUNA. With each \ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.\n\nHow to handle Nexvue\nNexvue is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin glargine.\n\nRead carefully the \"Nexvue Instructions for Use\" included in this pack. You must use the pen as \ndescribed in these Instructions for Use. \n\nA new needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that are compatible for use with \nNexvue (see “Nexvue Instructions for Use”). \n\nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34\n\nLook at the cartridge before you use the pen. Do not use Nexvue if you notice particles in it. Only use \nNexvue if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike. Do not shake or mix it before use.\n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, never share your pen with anyone else. This pen is \nonly for your use.\n\nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.\n\nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you \nthink you may have a problem with Nexvue, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n\nDo not use Nexvue if it is damaged or not working properly; it has to be discarded and a new pen has \nto be used.\n\nInsulin mix-ups\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between LUSDUNA\nand other insulins.\n\nIf you use more LUSDUNA than you should\n- If you have injected too much LUSDUNA, your blood sugar level may become too low \n\n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \nhypoglycaemia, see section “Hyperglycaemia and Hypoglycaemia” at the end of this leaflet.\n\nIf you forget to use LUSDUNA\n- If you have missed a dose of LUSDUNA or if you have not injected enough insulin, your \n\nblood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. \nFor information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see section “Hyperglycaemia and \nHypoglycaemia” at the end of this leaflet.\n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\nIf you stop using LUSDUNA\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop LUSDUNA without \nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nIf you notice signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take action to increase your\nblood sugar level straight away (see section “Hyperglycaemia and Hypoglycaemia” at the end of this\nleaflet). Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious and is very common with insulin \ntreatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Low blood sugar means that there is not enough \nsugar in your blood. If your blood sugar level falls too low, you may become unconscious. Serious \nhypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. For more information, see \nsection “Hyperglycaemia and Hypoglycaemia” at the end of this leaflet.\n\nSevere allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) – the signs may include large-\nscale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes \n(angioedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating. Severe \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35\n\nallergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. Tell a doctor straight away if you notice \nsigns of severe allergic reaction.\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n Skin changes at the injection site\nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \neither shrink (lipoatrophy, may affect up to 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). The insulin \nmay not work very well. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin \nchanges.\n\n Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site\nThese signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or \ninflammation. This can spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually \ndisappear in a few days to a few weeks.\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)\n Eye reactions \nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.\n\n General disorders \nIn rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling \nin the calves and ankles.\n\nVery rare side-effects (may affect up to1 in 10,000 people)\nIn very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur.\n\nUse in children and adolescents \nIn general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those \nseen in adults.\n\nComplaints of injection site reactions (injection site reaction, injection site pain) and skin reactions \n(rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age \nor less than in adults.\n\nThere is no experience in children under 2 years.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5. How to store LUSDUNA\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the pen \nafter “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.\n\nNot in-use pens\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C).

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \nresulting from lack of insulin.\n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia?\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \nhospital. \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)\n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.\n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur?\nExamples include: \n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand LUSDUNA\").\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40\n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation (when changing \n\nfrom your previous basal insulin to LUSDUNA, hypoglycaemia, if it occurs, may be more \nlikely to occur in the morning than at night), \n\n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.\n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia\nIn your body\nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heartbeat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.\n\nIn your brain\nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \nor may be missing altogether if\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \n\nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as LUSDUNA, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nLUSDUNA\"). \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing \ncan help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.\n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as \ndiet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.\n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \nThe recovery of hypoglycaemia may be delayed because LUSDUNA has a long action.\n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again, take another 10 to 20 g sugar.\n\n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.\n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41\n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42\n\nInstructions for use\n\nLUSDUNA100 units/mLsolution for injection in a pre-filled pen\n(Nexvue)\n\nInsulin glargine\n\nNeedles and alcohol swabs are not included.\n\nPLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE.\n\nImportant information\n LUSDUNA contains a medicine called insulin glargine.\n If you use more than one type of medicine, make sure you have the right medicine before \n\ninjecting.\n Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use your pen. If you haven’t been trained before, ask \n\nyour doctor or nurse to show you how to use your pen.\n Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that are compatible for use with\n\nyour pen (see section “Parts of your pen” below).\n Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached.\n Always perform the safety test before each injection.\n This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.\n\n If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to \navoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection.\n\n Never use the pen if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.\n Always have a spare pen in case your pen is lost or damaged.\n\nIt is important that you know how your insulin helps you and how to avoid the most common side \neffect - low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), which can be serious. Read about this in the Package leaflet\nsupplied in every carton. If you have any questions about this medicine or diabetes, please ask your \ndoctor or nurse for assistance.\n\nParts of your pen\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n43\n\nCaring for your pen\nNew pens you haven’t used before:\n\n Store pens in the box in the refrigerator (2°C- 8°C). Do not freeze. Make sure the pens are \naway from the freezer compartment or a freezer pack.\n If your pen is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up.\nCold insulin is more painful to inject.\n\nOnce you’ve opened and are using a pen:\n Do not put it back in the refrigerator or freeze. You should keep it at room temperature (below \n30°C).\n Keep it away from direct heat and light.\n You can clean the outside of your pen by wiping it with a damp cloth. Don’t run your pen under \nwater.\n Your pen is usable for up to 28 days after removal from the refrigerator.\n\n1. Getting ready\nAlways check you have the right pen. If you use more than one type of medicine, make sure you \n\nhave the right medicine before injecting.\n\nPlace a new sterile needle, two alcohol swabs and a pen on a clean, dry surface.

Prepare for your injection\nChoose your injection site\n\nYour abdomen, thigh, or back of your upper arm, are the best sites for injection.\n\n    \n\nClean your injection site\n\nClean the area with an alcohol swab. You should change injection site with each injection following \n\nthe advice of your doctor.\n\nCheck your insulin\n\nRemove the pen cap. Check the cartridge to make sure the insulin is clear, colourless and free of \n\nparticles.

Throw away the inner cap; you will not \n\nneed it again.\n\nUse a new needle each time. This helps to make sure you get the right insulin dose and it lowers your \n\nchances of any pain or illness from germs.\n\n5. Do a safety check\nEvery time you inject you need to do a small test dose to make sure your pen is working. This step \n\nhelps to ensure that you will get your full dose later on.\n\nDial a 2-unit test dose\n\nDial a test dose of two units by turning the dial until the black line points to “2”.\n\nTap the pen\n\nHold the pen upright and tap the cartridge gently to allow any air bubbles to rise to the top.\n\nPress to inject into the air\n\nPress the injection button all the way in while pointing the needle up into the air. Check to make sure \n\ninsulin comes out of the pen.\n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n47\n\nRepeat until you see insulin\n\nIf no medicine comes out, dial 2 units again and press the injection button again. It may take up to five \n\ntries. If it does not work, you will need to try with a new needle. See Step 9 for how to remove a \n\nneedle. If it does not work with a new needle, you will need to speak to your doctor or nurse.\n\nDo a safety check each time you inject. This helps make sure you get your full dose of insulin.\n\n6. Select the dose\nYou can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If the pen won’t let you dial your full dose, there \nmay not be enough insulin left in the pen. If you need to inject more than the number of units left in \nthe pen, you may either: \n- inject the amount left in your pen and then use a new pen to give the rest of your dose, or \n- get a new pen and inject the full dose.\n\nIf you need help deciding how to divide your dose, ask your doctor or nurse.\n\nYour dose number may be different than the one in this example. Follow the advice of your healthcare \n\nprovider.\n\nDial your dose\n\nDial your dose by turning the dial until the correct number lines up with the black line on the window.\n\n7.

Double-check that \n\nyou set the right dose before injecting.\n\nIf you have not yet cleaned your injection site, do it now before you inject.\n\nCheck the dose window...\n\nBefore you inject, make sure that the dose window is facing you. You need to see the window clearly \n\nduring the injection.\n\n8. Give the injection\n\nInsert the needle\n\nSimply insert the needle fully into the skin.

After the injection\nBe careful not to stick your finger with the needle.\n\nPress outer needle cap on firmly and use it to unscrew the needle.\n\nPut used needles in a closeable, puncture-resistant sharps container. Throw away the needle safely, as \n\ninstructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\nDo not reuse the needle; throw it away safely following the directions.\n\nStoring your pen\n\nSimply re-cap the pen, and store it without the needle for your next injection.
