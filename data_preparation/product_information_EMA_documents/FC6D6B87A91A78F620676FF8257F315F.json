NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTESLASCAN 0.01 mmol/ml solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 7.57 mg of anhydrous mangafodipir trisodium, 0.01 mmol (10 μmol), equivalent to \n6.91 mg of mangafodipir. \n50 ml contains 378.5 mg of anhydrous mangafodipir trisodium, 0.50 mmol (500 μmol), equivalent to \n345.5 mg of mangafodipir. \n \nExcipient: Sodium 0.16 mmol (3.6 mg)/ml equivalent to 126 mg per normal dose of 35 ml. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for infusion \n \nA clear bright to dark yellow solution, \n \nTESLASCAN has the following physicochemical properties: \n \npH: 7.0-8.0. \nOsmolality (mosmol/kg H2O) at 37 °C 290 \nViscosity (mPa.s) at 20 °C 1.0 \nViscosity (mPa.s) at 37 °C 0.7 \nDensity (g/ml) at 20 °C 1.01 \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \nContrast medium for diagnostic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for the detection of lesions of the \nliver suspected to be due to metastatic disease or hepatocellular carcinomas. As an adjunct to MRI to \naid in the investigation of focal pancreatic lesions. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe medicinal product is for single intravenous use only as repeated dosing has not been studied. It \nshould be administered as an intravenous infusion at the rate of 2-3 ml/min for liver imaging and at a \nrate of 4-6 ml/min for imaging of the pancreas. \n \nNear maximal enhancement of the normal liver and pancreas parenchyma is generally observed 15-20 \nminutes from the start of administration and lasts for approximately 4 hours. \n \nAt the clinical dose the contrast agent has no T2-effect, and pre- and post- T2-weighted images are \nequivalent. The clinical use of TESLASCAN has been investigated at field strengths from 0.5 to 2.0 \nTesla. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 3\n\nDosage for adults \nThe recommended dose is 0.5 ml/kg bodyweight (5 µmol/kg bodyweight). This corresponds to a dose \nof 35 ml for a 70 kg person. Above 100 kg body weight, 50 ml is usually sufficient to provide a \ndiagnostically adequate contrast effect. \n \nDosage for elderly \nPharmacokinetics in the elderly has not been investigated. However, clinical studies to date do not \nsuggest that a dose adjustment is required. \n \nUse in children \nThere are limited data available on the use of Teslascan in children. The available data do not support \nsafety and efficacy in the paediatric population and therefore such use is not recommended. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \nPregnancy and lactation.  \nPhaeochromocytoma.  \nSeverely reduced liver function (Child - Pugh class C), especially severe obstructive hepatobiliary \ndisease. \nSeverely reduced renal function. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRarely, hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria and other possible allergic phenomena) or anaphylactoid \nreactions may occur. Familiarity with the practice and technique of resuscitation and treatment of \nanaphylaxis is essential. Appropriate medicinal products and instruments should be readily available. \n \nCare should be exercised in patients with severe cardiac disease and in patients with injuries of the \nblood brain barrier and severe cerebral disease. \n \nThe fact that long term parenteral nutrition with manganese supplementation can cause manganese \naccumulation in the basal ganglia should be considered when administering TESLASCAN to patients \non such treatment. \n \nThis medicinal product contains 5.5 mmol (126 mg) sodium per normal dose of 35 ml. To be taken \ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThe safety of TESLASCAN in human pregnancy has not been established. TESLASCAN must not be \nused during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \nPrior to administration of TESLASCAN to women of child bearing potential, pregnancy should be \nexcluded. \n \nPre-clinical studies in rats have established teratogenic effects when TESLASCAN was given \nrepeatedly during major organogenesis. TESLASCAN causes foetotoxicity and embryotoxicity in \nrabbits. TESLASCAN is not teratogenic in rabbits. TESLASCAN has no effect on male or female \nfertility in rats. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 4\n\nLactation \nThe degree of excretion into human breast milk is not known.

Those most commonly \nreported were: feeling of warmth/flushing, headache and nausea. \nIn clinical trials with Teslascan, adverse reactions have been reported with the following frequencies \ngiven in the table below (very common ≥1/10; common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare <1/10,000, not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Paramagnetic MRI contrast medium, ATC Code: V08C A05 \n \nMangafodipir is a chelate containing the metal manganese - which has paramagnetic properties and is \nresponsible for the contrast enhancement effect in MRI - and the ligand fodipir (dipyridoxyl \ndiphosphate). Manganese is preferentially taken up by normal liver parenchyma and also in the \npancreas so that contrast enhancement between abnormal and normal tissue can be expected. \n \nThe effect of mangafodipir is to shorten the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) of targeted tissues during \nMRI, leading to an increase in signal intensity (brightness) of, for example, pancreas and liver \nparenchyma. Enhancement in both organs is near maximal for up to approx. 4 hours after the end of \nadministration. Lesion-related enhancement of certain types of lesions, such as liver metastases and \nhepatocellular carcinomas, may be detectable for up to 24 hours. Clinical studies have demonstrated \nthat mangafodipir facilitates the detection of liver lesions in patients with such lesions. \n \nTESLASCAN is isotonic with blood and normal body fluids. \n \nPaediatric use \n \nAn uncontrolled observational study assessed the use of mangafodipir in the radiological assessment \nof infant patients with suspected bilary atresia. 23 consecutive patients aged 24-139 days (mean 69 \ndays) with prolonged jaundice and lightened stool colour in whom bilary atresia had not been ruled \nout underwent MR cholangiography with contrast. The dose of mangafodipir used was 5 μmol/kg. No \nsafety concerns arose from this study, although the numbers were too small to be useful in this regard. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nMangafodipir trisodium is metabolised (dephosphorylated) and manganese ions are released from the \nmangafodipir by exchange with plasma zinc (mainly) after intravenous administration. Manganese and \nthe ligand (fodipir), which have different pharmacokinetics, are eliminated by different routes. \n \nThe mean initial plasma half-life of manganese is 20 minutes or less, with significant uptake into the \nliver, pancreas, kidneys and spleen. The initial plasma half-life of ligand is about 50 minutes. The \nvolume of distribution for manganese is between 0.5 and 1.5 l/kg, and for fodipir 0.17 to 0.45 l/kg. \nFollowing its metabolism, nearly all of the ligand (fodipir) is excreted in urine within 24 hours, with \nnegligible amounts being eliminated via the faeces. About 15-20 % of the manganese is eliminated in \nthe urine within the first 24 hours, most of the remainder is excreted in the faeces over the following 4 \ndays. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n 6\n\nIn whole human blood in vitro, the protein binding of manganese is approximately 27 % but binding \nof fodipir to protein is negligible. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical studies reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \ngenotoxicity, safety pharmacology and validating kinetics and metabolism. Relevant adverse effects \nfrom repeated dose toxicity studies were liver toxicity (cholangiohepatitis) observed at relatively low \ndosages in dogs, while sufficient margins of safety were determined in rats and monkeys. \n \nMangafodipir is teratogenic in rats; it causes increased foetal skeletal abnormalities when given daily \nby intravenous injection to female rats at dosages slightly greater than clinical dosages. Embryo- and \nfoetotoxicity has been observed in rabbits. \n \n \n6.
