CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRenal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) \n\n \n\nCABOMETYX is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC): \n\n- in treatment-naïve adults with intermediate or poor risk (see section 5.1) \n\n- in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy \n\nHepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) \n\nCABOMETYX is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in \n\nadults who have previously been treated with sorafenib. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy with CABOMETYX should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of \n\nanticancer medicinal products.  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nCABOMETYX (cabozantinib) tablets and COMETRIQ (cabozantinib) capsules are not bioequivalent \n\nand should not be used interchangeably (see section 5.2). If a patient must switch from cabozantinib \n\ncapsules to cabozantinib tablets, the patient should continue at a CABOMETYX dose not to exceed \n\n60 mg or the current COMETRIQ dose (whichever is lower). \n\n \n\nFor RCC and HCC, the recommended dose of CABOMETYX is 60 mg once daily. Treatment should \n\ncontinue until the patient is no longer clinically benefiting from therapy or until unacceptable toxicity \n\noccurs. \n\n \n\nManagement of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary treatment interruption and/or \n\ndose reduction of CABOMETYX therapy (see Table 1). When dose reduction is necessary, it is \n\nrecommended to reduce to 40 mg daily, and then to 20 mg daily. Dose interruptions are recommended \n\nfor management of CTCAE grade 3 or greater toxicities or intolerable grade 2 toxicities. Dose \n\nreductions are recommended for events that, if persistent, could become serious or intolerable. \n\n \n\nIf a patient misses a dose, the missed dose should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours before the \n\nnext dose. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 1: Recommended CABOMETYX dose modifications for adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reaction and severity  Treatment Modification \n\nGrade 1 and Grade 2 adverse \n\nreactions which are tolerable and \n\neasily managed \n\nDose adjustment is usually not required.  \n\nAdd supportive care as indicated.  \n\nGrade 2 adverse reactions which are \n\nintolerable and cannot be managed \n\nwith a dose reduction or supportive \n\ncare \n\nInterrupt treatment until the adverse reaction resolves to \n\nGrade ≤1.  \n\nAdd supportive care as indicated. \n\nConsider re-initiating at a reduced dose.  \n\nGrade 3 adverse reactions (except \n\nclinically nonrelevant laboratory \n\nabnormalities) \n\nInterrupt treatment until the adverse reaction resolves to \n\nGrade ≤1.  \n\nAdd supportive care as indicated. \n\nRe-initiate at a reduced dose. \n\nGrade 4 adverse reactions (except \n\nclinically nonrelevant laboratory \n\nabnormalities) \n\nInterrupt treatment.  \n\nInstitute appropriate medical care. \n\nIf adverse reaction resolves to Grade ≤1, re-initiate at a \n\nreduced dose. \n\nIf adverse reaction does not resolve, permanently \n\ndiscontinue CABOMETYX. \n\nNote: Toxicity grades are in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology \n\nCriteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4)  \n\n \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \n\nConcomitant medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be used with caution, \n\nand chronic use of concomitant medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be \n\navoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSelection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce or \n\ninhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo specific dose adjustment for the use of cabozantinib in older people (≥ 65 years) is recommended.  \n\n \n\nRace \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on ethnicity (see section 5.2)  \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment  \n\nCabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  \n\nCabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment as safety and \n\nefficacy have not been established in this population. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with mild hepatic impairment no dose adjustment is required. Since only limited data are \n\navailable for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), no dosing recommendation \n\ncan be provided. Close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in these patients (see sections 4.4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\nand 5.2).There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), so \n\ncabozantinib is not recommended for use in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with cardiac impairment \n\nThere are limited data in patients with cardiac impairment. No specific dosing recommendations can \n\nbe made. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of cabozantinib in children and adolescents aged <18 years have not yet been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nCABOMETYX is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed. Patients \n\nshould be instructed to not eat anything for at least 2 hours before through 1 hour after taking \n\nCABOMETYX. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nAs most events occur early in the course of treatment, the physician should evaluate the patient \n\nclosely during the first eight weeks of treatment to determine if dose modifications are warranted. \n\nEvents that generally have early onset include hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, thrombocytopenia, \n\nhypertension,  \n\npalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), proteinuria, and gastrointestinal (GI) events \n\n(abdominal pain, mucosal inflammation, constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting). \n\n \n\nIn renal cell carcinoma following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy, \n\ndose reductions and dose interruptions due to an AE occurred in 59.8% and 70%, respectively, of \n\ncabozantinib-treated patients in the pivotal clinical trial (METEOR). Two dose reductions were \n\nrequired in 19.3% of patients. The median time to first dose reduction was 55 days, and to first dose \n\ninterruption was 38 days. \n\n \n\nIn treatment-naïve renal cell carcinoma, dose reductions and dose interruptions occurred in 46% and \n\n73%, respectively, of cabozantinib-treated patients in the clinical trial (CABOSUN). \n\n \n\nIn hepatocellular carcinoma following prior systemic therapy, dose reductions and dose interruptions \n\noccurred in 62% and 84%, respectively, of cabozantinib-treated patients in the clinical trial \n\n(CELESTIAL). Two dose reductions were required in 33% of patients. The median time to first dose \n\nreduction was 38 days, and to first dose interruption was 28 days. Closer monitoring is advised in \n\npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  \n\n \n\nHepatic effects  \n\nAbnormalities of liver function tests (increases in alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate \n\naminotransferase [AST] and bilirubin) have been frequently observed in patients treated with \n\ncabozantinib. It is recommended to perform liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before \n\ninitiation of cabozantinib treatment and to monitor closely during treatment. For patients with \n\nworsening of liver function tests considered related to cabozantinib treatment (i.e. where no \n\nalternative cause is evident), the dose modification advice in Table 1 should be followed (see section \n\n4.2). \n\nCabozantinib is eliminated mainly via the hepatic route. Closer monitoring of the overall safety is \n\nrecommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see also sections 4.2 and 5.2). A \n\nhigher relative proportion of patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) developed \n\n\n\n6 \n\nhepatic encephalopathy with cabozantinib treatment. Cabometyx is not recommended for use in \n\npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) as cabozantinib has not been studied in this \n\npopulation and exposure might be increased in these patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic encephalopathy \n\nIn the HCC study (CELESTIAL), hepatic encephalopathy was reported more frequently in the \n\ncabozantinib than the placebo arm. Cabozantinib has been associated with diarrhoea, vomiting, \n\ndecreased appetite and electrolyte abnormalities. In HCC patients with compromised livers, these \n\nnon-hepatic effects may be precipitating factors for the development of hepatic encephalopathy. \n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. \n\n \n\nPerforations and fistulas  \n\nSerious gastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistulas, sometimes fatal, have been observed with \n\ncabozantinib. Patients who have inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, \n\nperitonitis, diverticulitis, or appendicitis), have tumour infiltration in the GI tract, or have \n\ncomplications from prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete \n\nhealing) should be carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib therapy and subsequently they \n\nshould be monitored closely for symptoms of perforations and fistulas including abscesses and sepsis. \n\nPersistent or recurring diarrhoea while on treatment may be a risk factor for the development of anal \n\nfistula. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who experience a GI perforation or a fistula \nthat cannot be adequately managed. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal (GI) disorders  \n\nDiarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, decreased appetite, and stomatitis/oral pain were some of the most \n\ncommonly reported GI adverse reactions (see section 4.8). Prompt medical management, including \n\nsupportive care with antiemetics, antidiarrhoeals, or antacids, should be instituted to prevent \n\ndehydration, electrolyte imbalances and weight loss. Dose interruption or reduction, or permanent \n\ndiscontinuation of cabozantinib should be considered in case of persistent or recurrent significant GI \n\nadverse reactions (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nThromboembolic events \n\nEvents of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism, and arterial thromboembolism, \n\nsometimes fatal, have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib should be used with caution in \n\npatients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, these events. In the HCC study (CELESTIAL), \n\nportal vein thrombosis was observed with cabozantinib, including one fatal event. Patients with a \n\nhistory of portal vein invasion appeared to be at higher risk of developing portal vein thrombosis.  \n\nCabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or any \n\nother clinically significant thromboembolic complication. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nSevere haemorrhage, sometimes fatal, has been observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have a \n\nhistory of severe bleeding prior to treatment initiation should be carefully evaluated before initiating \n\ncabozantinib therapy. Cabozantinib should not be administered to patients that have or are at risk for \n\nsevere haemorrhage. \n\nIn the HCC study (CELESTIAL), fatal haemorrhagic events were reported at a higher incidence with \n\ncabozantinib than placebo. Predisposing risk factors for severe haemorrhage in the advanced HCC \n\npopulation may include tumour invasion of major blood vessels and the presence of underlying liver \n\ncirrhosis resulting in oesophageal varices, portal hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. The \n\nCELESTIAL study excluded patients with concomitant anticoagulation treatment or antiplatelet \n\nagents. Subjects with untreated, or incompletely treated, varices with bleeding or high risk for \n\nbleeding were also excluded from this study. \n\n \n\nAneurysms and artery dissections \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \n\nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating cabozantinib, this risk should be \n\ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nIn the HCC study (CELESTIAL), thrombocytopenia and decreased platelets were reported. Platelet \n\nlevels should be monitored during cabozantinib treatment and the dose modified according to the \n\nseverity of the thrombocytopenia (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nWound complications \n\nWound complications have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib treatment should be \n\nstopped at least 28 days prior to scheduled surgery, including dental surgery, if possible. The decision \n\nto resume cabozantinib therapy after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound \n\nhealing. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients with wound healing complications requiring \n\nmedical intervention. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nHypertension has been observed with cabozantinib. Blood pressure should be well-controlled prior to \n\ninitiating cabozantinib. During treatment with cabozantinib, all patients should be monitored for \n\nhypertension and treated as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. In the case of persistent \n\nhypertension despite use of anti-hypertensives, the cabozantinib dose should be reduced. Cabozantinib \n\nshould be discontinued if hypertension is severe and persistent despite anti-hypertensive therapy and \n\ndose reduction of cabozantinib.  In case of hypertensive crisis, cabozantinib should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome  \n\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) has been observed with cabozantinib.  When \n\nPPES is severe, interruption of treatment with cabozantinib should be considered. Cabozantinib \n\nshould be restarted with a lower dose when PPES has been resolved to grade 1. \n\n \n\nProteinuria \n\nProteinuria has been observed with cabozantinib.  Urine protein should be monitored regularly during \n\ncabozantinib treatment. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic \n\nsyndrome. \n\n \n\nReversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome  \n\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), also known as Posterior Reversible \n\nEncephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), has been observed with cabozantinib. This syndrome should be \n\nconsidered in any patient presenting with multiple symptoms, including seizures, headache, visual \n\ndisturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Cabozantinib treatment should be discontinued in \n\npatients with RPLS. \n\n \n\n \n\nProlongation of QT interval  \n\nCabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, \n\npatients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, \n\nbradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances. When using cabozantinib, periodic monitoring with on-\n\ntreatment ECGs and electrolytes (serum calcium, potassium, and magnesium) should be considered.  \n\n \n\nBiochemical laboratory test abnormalities \n\nCabozantinib has been associated with an increased incidence of electrolyte abnormalities (including \n\nhypo- and hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyponatremia). It is recommended to \n\nmonitor biochemical parameters during cabozantinib treatment and to institute appropriate \n\nreplacement therapy according to standard clinical practice if required. Cases of hepatic \n\nencephalopathy in HCC patients can be attributed to the development of electrolyte disturbances. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nDose interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of cabozantinib should be considered in \n\ncase of persistent or recurrent significant abnormalities (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors \n\nCabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in an increase in cabozantinib plasma exposure. Caution is \n\nrequired when administering cabozantinib with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concurrent \n\nadministration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin resulted in a decrease in \n\ncabozantinib plasma exposure. Therefore, chronic administration of agents that are strong CYP3A4 \n\ninducers with cabozantinib should be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein substrates  \n\nCabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport \n\nactivities in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may \n\nhave the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects \n\nshould be cautioned regarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, \n\ndabigatran etexilate, digoxin, colchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, \n\ntalinolol, tolvaptan) while receiving cabozantinib (see section 4.5). \n \n\nMRP2 inhibitors \n\nAdministration of MRP2 inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations. \n\nTherefore, concomitant use of MRP2 inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine, efavirenz, emtricitabine) should be \n\napproached with caution (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nExcipient related warnings \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or \n\nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nEffect of other medicinal products on cabozantinib \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers \n\nAdministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy \n\nvolunteers decreased cabozantinib clearance (by 29%) and increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib \n\nexposure (AUC) by 38%. Therefore, co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, \n\nitraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) with cabozantinib should be approached \n\nwith caution.  \n\n \n\nAdministration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy \n\nvolunteers increased cabozantinib clearance (4.3-fold) and decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib \n\nexposure (AUC) by 77%. Chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, \n\ncarbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort \n\n[Hypericum perforatum]) with cabozantinib should therefore be avoided.  \n\n \n\nGastric pH modifying agents \n\nCo-administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single \n\ndose of 100 mg cabozantinib to healthy volunteers resulted in no clinically-significant effect on \n\nplasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC). No dose adjustment is indicated when gastric pH modifying \n\nagents (i.e., PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, and antacids) are co-administered with cabozantinib. \n\n \n\nMRP2 inhibitors \n\nIn vitro data demonstrate that cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2. Therefore, administration of \n\nMRP2 inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations.  \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nBile salt-sequestering agents \n\nBile salt-sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and cholestagel may interact with cabozantinib \n\nand may impact absorption (or reabsorption) resulting in potentially decreased exposure (see section \n\n5.2). The clinical significance of these potential interactions is unknown. \n\n \n\nEffect of cabozantinib on other medicinal products \n\nThe effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive steroids has not been \n\ninvestigated. As unchanged contraceptive effect may not be guaranteed, an additional contraceptive \n\nmethod, such as a barrier method, is recommended. \n\nBecause of high plasma protein binding levels of cabozantinib (section 5.2) a plasma protein \n\ndisplacement interaction with warfarin may be possible. In case of such combination, INR values \n\nshould be monitored. \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein substrates  \n\nCabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities in a \n\nbi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the \n\npotential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should be \n\ncautioned regarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran \n\netexilate, digoxin, colchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, \n\ntolvaptan) while receiving cabozantinib. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on cabozantinib. Female \n\npartners of male patients taking cabozantinib must also avoid pregnancy. Effective methods of \n\ncontraception should be used by male and female patients and their partners during therapy, and for at \n\nleast 4 months after completing therapy. Because oral contraceptives might possibly not be considered \n\nas “effective methods of contraception”, they should be used together with another method, such as a \n\nbarrier method (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no studies in pregnant women using cabozantinib. Studies in animals have shown \n\nembryo-foetal and teratogenic effects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nCabozantinib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \n\ntreatment with cabozantinib. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether cabozantinib and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of \n\nthe potential harm to the infant, mothers should discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with \n\ncabozantinib, and for at least 4 months after completing therapy. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data on human fertility. Based on non-clinical safety findings, male and female fertility \n\nmay be compromised by treatment with cabozantinib (see section 5.3). Both men and women should \n\nbe advised to seek advice and consider fertility preservation before treatment. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nCabozantinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions such as \n\nfatigue and weakness have been associated with cabozantinib.  Therefore, caution should be \n\nrecommended when driving or operating machines. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common serious adverse drug reactions in the RCC population (≥1% incidence) are \n\ndiarrhoea, hypertension, dehydration, hyponatraemia, nausea, decreased appetite, embolism, fatigue, \n\nhypomagnesaemia, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES).   \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (experienced by at least 25% of patients) in the \n\nRCC population included diarrhoea, hypertension, fatigue, AST increased, ALT increased, nausea, \n\ndecreased appetite, PPES, dysgeusia, platelet count decreased, stomatitis, anaemia, vomiting, weight \n\ndecreased, dyspepsia, and constipation. Hypertension was observed more frequently in the treatment \n\nnaïve RCC population (67%) compared to RCC patients following prior VEGF-targeted therapy \n\n(37%). \n\n \n\nThe most common serious adverse drug reactions in the HCC population (≥1% incidence) are hepatic \n\nencephalopathy, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, asthenia and diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (experienced by at least 25% of patients) in the \n\nHCC population included diarrhoea, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, fatigue, decreased \n\nappetite hypertension and nausea. \n\n \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions are listed in Table 2 according to MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency \n\ncategories. Frequencies are based on all grades and defined as: very common (≥1/10), common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 2: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in clinical trials in patients treated with \n\ncabozantinib \n\n \n\nMedDRA \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nVery Common  Common  Uncommon  Not Known \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\n abscess   \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\ndisorders \n\nanaemia thrombocytopenia, \n\nneutropenia \n\nlymphopenia  \n\nEndocrine \n\ndisorders \n\nhypothyroidism    \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition \n\ndisorders \n\ndecreased appetite, \n\nhypomagnesaemia, \n\nhypokalaemia \n\ndehydration, \n\nhypoalbuminaemia, \n\nhypophosphataemia, \n\nhyponatraemia, \n\nhypocalcaemia, \n\nhyperkalaemia, \n\nhyperbilirubinemia \n\nhyperglycaemia, \n\nhypoglycaemia \n\n  \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\ndysgeusia, \n\nheadache, dizziness \n\nperipheral sensory \n\nneuropathy \n\nconvulsion cerebrovascul\n\nar accident \n\nEar and \n\nlabyrinth \n\ndisorders \n\n tinnitus   \n\nCardiac \n\ndisorders \n\n   myocardial \n\ninfarction \n\nVascular \n\ndisorders \n\nhypertension, \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nvenous thrombosis \n\narterial thrombosis \n\n \n\n Aneurysms \n\nand artery \n\ndissections \n\nRespiratory, \n\nthoracic, and \n\nmediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\ndysphonia, \n\ndyspnoea, cough \n\npulmonary embolism   \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\ndiarrhoea, nausea, \n\nvomiting, \n\nstomatitis, \n\nconstipation, \n\nabdominal pain, \n\ndyspepsia, upper \n\nabdominal pain  \n\ngastrointestinal \n\nperforation, fistula, \n\ngastroesophageal \n\nreflux disease, \n\nhaemorrhoids, oral \n\npain, dry mouth \n\npancreatitis, \n\nglossodynia \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nMedDRA \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nVery Common  Common  Uncommon  Not Known \n\nHepatobiliary \n\ndisorders \n\n Hepatic \n\nencephalopathy \n\nhepatitis \n\ncholestatic \n\n \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\npalmar-plantar \n\nerythrodysaesthesia \n\nsyndrome, rash \n\npruritus, alopecia, \n\ndry skin, dermatitis \n\nacneiform, hair \n\ncolour change \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal \n\nand connective \n\ntissue disorders \n\npain in extremity muscle spasms, \n\narthralgia \n\nosteonecrosis of \n\nthe jaw \n\n \n\nRenal and \n\nurinary \n\ndisorders \n\n proteinuria   \n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministration \n\nsite conditions \n\nfatigue, mucosal \n\ninflammation, \n\nasthenia, peripheral \n\noedema \n\n   \n\nInvestigations weight decreased, \n\nserum ALT \n\nincreased, AST \n\nincreased \n\nblood ALP \n\nincreased, GGT \n\nincreased, blood \n\ncreatinine increased, \n\namylase increased, \n\nlipase increased, \n\nblood cholesterol \n\nincreased, white \n\nblood cell count \n\ndecreased \n\nblood \n\ntriglycerides \n\nincreased \n\n \n\nInjury, \n\npoisoning and \n\nprocedural \n\ncomplications  \n\n  wound \n\ncomplications \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nData for the following reactions are based on patients who received Cabometyx 60 mg qd po in the \n\npivotal studies in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy and in treatment-naïve RCC and in \n\nHCC following prior systemic therapy (section 5.1).  \n\n \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal (GI) perforation \n\nIn the study in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (METEOR), GI perforations were \n\nreported in 0.9% (3/331) of cabozantinib-treated RCC patients. Events were Grade 2 or 3. Median \n\ntime to onset was 10.0 weeks.  \n\nIn the treatment-naïve RCC study (CABOSUN), GI perforations were reported in 2.6% (2/78) of \n\ncabozantinib-treated patients. Events were Grade 4 and 5. \n\nIn the HCC study (CELESTIAL), GI perforations were reported in 0.9% of cabozantinib-treated \n\npatients (4/467). All events were Grade 3 or 4. Median time to onset was 5.9 weeks. \n\n\n\n13 \n\nFatal perforations have occurred in the cabozantinib clinical program. \n\n \n\nHepatic encephalopathy \n\nIn the HCC study (CELESTIAL), hepatic encephalopathy (hepatic encephalopathy, encephalopathy, \n\nhyperammonaemic encephalopathy) was reported in 5.6% of cabozantinib-treated patients (26/467); \n\nGrade 3-4 events in 2.8%, and one (0.2%) Grade 5 event. Median time to onset was 5.9 weeks. \n\nNo cases of hepatic encephalopathy were reported in the RCC studies (METEOR and CABOSUN). \n\n \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea \n\nIn the study in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (METEOR), diarrhoea was reported in \n\n74% of cabozantinib-treated RCC patients (245/331); Grade 3-4 events in 11%. . Median time to \n\nonset was 4.9 weeks.  \n\nIn the treatment-naïve RCC study (CABOSUN), diarrhoea was reported in 73% of cabozantinib-\n\ntreated patients (57/78);Grade 3-4 events in 10%..  \n\nIn the HCC study (CELESTIAL), diarrhoea was reported in 54% of cabozantinib-treated patients \n\n(251/467);Grade 3- 4 events in 9.9%. Median time to onset of all events was 4.1 weeks. Diarrhoea led \n\nto dose modifications, interruptions and discontinuations in 84/467 (18%), 69/467 (15%) and 5/467 \n\n(1%) of subjects, respectively. \n\n \n\nFistulas \n\nIn the study in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (METEOR), fistulas were reported in \n\n1.2% (4/331) of cabozantinib-treated patients and included anal fistulas in 0.6% (2/331) cabozantinib-\n\ntreated patients. One event was Grade 3; the remainder were Grade 2. Median time to onset was 30.3 \n\nweeks. \n\nIn the treatment-naïve RCC study (CABOSUN), no cases of fistulas were reported. \n\nIn the HCC study (CELESTIAL), fistulas were reported in 1.5% (7/467) of the HCC patients. Median \n\ntime to onset was 14 weeks. \n\nFatal fistulas have occurred in the cabozantinib clinical program \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nIn the study in RCC following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (METEOR), the incidence of severe \n\nhaemorrhagic events (Grade ≥ 3) was 2.1% (7/331) in cabozantinib-treated RCC patients. Median \n\ntime to onset was 20.9 weeks.  \n\nIn the treatment-naïve RCC study (CABOSUN), the incidence of severe haemorrhagic events (Grade \n\n≥ 3) was 5.1% (4/78) in cabozantinib-treated RCC patients. \n\nIn the HCC study (CELESTIAL), the incidence of severe haemorrhagic events (Grade ≥ 3) was 7.3% \n\nin cabozantinib-treated patients (34/467). Median time to onset was 9.1 weeks. \n\nFatal haemorrhages have occurred in the cabozantinib clinical program.  \n\n \n\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) \n\nNo case of RPLS was reported in the METEOR or CABOSUN or CELESTIAL studies, but RPLS has \n\nbeen reported rarely in other clinical studies (in 2/4872 subjects; 0.04%). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \n\nin Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no specific treatment for cabozantinib overdose and possible symptoms of overdose have not \n\nbeen established. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIn the event of suspected overdose, cabozantinib should be withheld and supportive care instituted. \n\nMetabolic clinical laboratory parameters should be monitored at least weekly or as deemed clinically \n\nappropriate to assess any possible changing trends. Adverse reactions associated with overdose are to \n\nbe treated symptomatically. \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE26. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nCabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in \n\ntumour growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodeling, drug resistance, and metastatic \n\nprogression of cancer. Cabozantinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of \n\nkinases and was identified as an inhibitor of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and \n\nVEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) receptors. In addition, cabozantinib inhibits other tyrosine \n\nkinases including the GAS6 receptor (AXL), RET, ROS1, TYRO3, MER, the stem cell factor \n\nreceptor (KIT), TRKB, Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), and TIE-2.    \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nCabozantinib exhibited dose-related tumour growth inhibition, tumour regression, and/or inhibited \n\nmetastasis in a broad range of preclinical tumour models. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nAn increase from baseline in corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) of 10 – 15 ms on Day 29 \n\n(but not on Day 1) following initiation of cabozantinib treatment (at a dose of 140 mg qd) was \nobserved in a controlled clinical study in medullary thyroid cancer patients. This effect was not \n\nassociated with a change in cardiac wave form morphology or new rhythms. No cabozantinib-treated \n\nsubjects in this study had a confirmed QTcF >500 ms, nor did any cabozantinib-treated subjects in the \nRCC or HCC studies (at a dose of 60  mg). \n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nClinical data in renal cell carcinoma following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-\n\ntargeted therapy  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of CABOMETYX for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma following prior \n\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy were evaluated in a randomized, open-\nlabel, multicenter Phase 3 study (METEOR). Patients (N=658) with advanced RCC with a clear cell \n\ncomponent who had previously received at least 1 prior VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor \n\n(VEGFR TKI) were randomized (1:1) to receive CABOMETYX (N=330) or everolimus (N=328). \n\nPatients could have received other prior therapies, including cytokines, and antibodies targeting \n\nVEGF, the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor, or its ligands. Patients with treated brain metastases \n\nwere allowed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by a blinded independent radiology \n\nreview committee, and the primary analysis was conducted among the first 375 subjects randomized. \n\nSecondary efficacy endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Tumor \n\nassessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months, then every 12 weeks thereafter. \n\n \n\nThe baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the CABOMETYX and \n\neverolimus arms. The majority of the patients were male (75%), with a median age of 62 years. \n\nSeventy-one percent (71%) received only one prior VEGFR TKI; 41% of patients received sunitinib \n\nas their only prior VEGFR TKI. According to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center criteria \n\nfor prognostic risk category, 46% were favorable (0 risk factors), 42% were intermediate (1 risk \n\nfactor), and 13% were poor (2 or 3 risk factors). Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients had 3 or more \n\n\n\n15 \n\norgans with metastatic disease, including lung (63%), lymph nodes (62%), liver (29%), and bone \n\n(22%). The median duration of treatment was 7.6 months (range 0.3 – 20.5) for patients receiving \n\nCABOMETYX and 4.4 months (range 0.21 – 18.9) for patients receiving everolimus. \n\n \n\nA statistically significant improvement in PFS was demonstrated for CABOMETYX compared to \n\neverolimus (Figure 1 and Table 3). A planned interim analysis of OS was conducted at the time of the \n\nPFS analysis and did not reach the interim boundary for statistical significance (202 events, HR=0.68 \n\n[0.51, 0.90], p=0.006). In a subsequent unplanned interim analysis of OS, a statistically significant \n\nimprovement was demonstrated for patients randomized to CABOMETYX as compared with \n\neverolimus (320 events, median of 21.4 months vs. 16.5 months; HR=0.66 [0.53, 0.83], p=0.0003; \n\nFigure 2). Comparable results for OS were observed with a follow-up analysis (descriptive) at 430 \n\nevents. \n\n \n\nExploratory analyses of PFS and OS in the ITT population have also shown consistent results in \n\nfavour of CABOMETYX compared to everolimus across different subgroups according to age (<65 \n\nvs. ≥65, sex, MSKCC risk group (favourable, intermediate, poor), ECOG status (0 vs. 1), time from \n\ndiagnosis to randomisation (<1 year vs. ≥1 year), tumour MET status (high vs. low vs. unknown), \n\nbone metastases (absence vs. presence), visceral metastases (absence vs. presence), visceral and bone \n\nmetastases (absence vs. presence), number of prior VEGFR-TKIs (1 vs. ≥2), duration of first VEGFR-\n\nTKI (≤6 months vs. >6 months). \n\n \n\nObjective response rate findings are summarized in Table 4. \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan Meier curve for progression-free survival by independent radiology review \n\ncommittee, in RCC subjects following prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-\n\ntargeted therapy (first 375 subjects randomized) (METEOR) \n\nM o n th s\n\nP\nr\no\n\nb\na\n\nb\nil\n\nit\ny\n\n o\nf \n\nP\nr\no\n\ng\nr\ne\n\ns\ns\n\nio\nn\n\n-f\nr\ne\n\ne\n S\n\nu\nr\nv\n\niv\na\n\nl\n\n0 3 6 9 1 2 1 5 1 8\n\n0 .0\n\n0 .1\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .3\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .5\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .7\n\n0 .8\n\n0 .9\n\n1 .0\n\nNo. at Risk \n       CABOMETYX 187 152 92 68 20 6 2 \n\nEverolimus 188 99 46 29 10 2 0 \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n o\n\nf \nP\n\nro\ng\n\nre\ns\ns\nio\n\nn\n-f\n\nre\ne\n S\n\nu\nrv\n\niv\na\nl \n\nMonths Number at risk: \n\nCABOMETYX \n\nEverolimus \n\nCABOMETYX \n\nEverolimus \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTable 3: Summary of PFS findings by independent radiology review committee in RCC subjects \n\nfollowing prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy (METEOR) \n\n \n\n Primary PFS analysis Population Intent-To-Treat Population \n\nEndpoint CABOMETYX Everolimus CABOMETYX Everolimus \n\n N = 187 N = 188 N = 330 N = 328 \n\nMedian PFS (95% \n\nCI), months \n\n7.4 (5.6, 9.1) 3.8 (3.7, 5.4) 7.4 (6.6, 9.1) 3.9 (3.7, 5.1) \n\nHR (95% CI), \n\np-value1 \n\n0.58 (0.45, 0.74), p<0.0001 0.51 (0.41, 0.62), p<0.0001 \n\n1 stratified log-rank test \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier curve of overall survival in RCC subjects following prior vascular \n\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy (METEOR) \n\nM o n th s\n\nP\nr\no\n\nb\na\n\nb\nil\n\nit\ny\n\n o\nf \n\nO\nv\n\ne\nr\na\n\nll\n S\n\nu\nr\nv\n\niv\na\n\nl\n\n0 3 6 9 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 1 2 4 2 7 3 0\n\n0 .0\n\n0 .1\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .3\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .5\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .7\n\n0 .8\n\n0 .9\n\n1 .0\n\nC A B O M E T Y X\n\nE v e ro lim u s\n\n330 318 296 264 239 178 105 41 6 3 0\n\n328 307 262 229 202 141 82 32 8 1 0\n\n \n \n\nP\nro\n\nb\na\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n o\n\nf \nO\n\nv\ne\n\nra\nll\n S\n\nu\nrv\n\niv\na\nl \n\nMonths Number at risk: \n\nCABOMETYX \n\nEverolimus \n\nCABOMETYX \n\nEverolimus \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 4: Summary of ORR findings per independent radiology committee review (IRC) and \n\ninvestigator review, in RCC subjects following prior vascular endothelial growth factor \n\n(VEGF)-targeted therapy \n\n \n\n Primary Analysis ORR Intent-\n\nTo-Treat Population (IRC) \n\nORR per Investigator Review \n\nIntent-To-Treat Population \n\nEndpoint CABOMETYX Everolimus CABOMETYX Everolimus \n\n N = 330 N = 328 N = 330 N = 328 \n\nORR (partial \n\nresponses only) \n\n(95% CI) \n\n17% (13%, 22%) 3% (2%, 6%) 24% (19%, 29%) 4% (2%, 7%) \n\np-value1 p<0.0001 p< 0.0001 \n\nPartial Response 17% 3% 24% 4% \n\nMedian time to \n\nFirst Response, \n\nmonths (95% CI) \n\n1.91 (1.6, 11.0) 2.14 (1.9, 9.2) 1.91 (1.3, 9.8) 3.50 (1.8, 5.6) \n\nStable Disease as \n\nBest Response \n\n65% 62% 63% 63% \n\nProgressive Disease \n\nas Best Response \n\n12% 27% 9% 27% \n\n1 chi-squared test \n\n \n\nClinical data in treatment-naïve renal cell carcinoma \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of CABOMETYX for the treatment of treatment-naïve renal cell carcinoma \n\nwere evaluated in a randomized, open-label, multicenter study (CABOSUN). Patients (N=157) with \n\npreviously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component were randomized \n\n(1:1) to receive CABOMETYX (N=79) or sunitinib (N=78). Patients had to have intermediate or poor \n\nrisk disease as defined by the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group \n\ncategories. Patients were stratified by IMDC risk group and presence of bone metastases (yes/no). \n\nApproximately 75% of patients had a nephrectomy prior to onset of treatment. \n\nFor intermediate risk disease, one or two of the following risk factors were met, while for poor risk, \n\nthree or more factors were met: time from diagnosis of RCC to systemic treatment < 1 year, Hgb < \n\nLLN, Corrected calcium > ULN, KPS < 80%, Neutrophil count > ULN and Platelet count > ULN. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was PFS. Secondary efficacy endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and \n\noverall survival (OS). Tumor assessments were conducted every 12 weeks. \n\n \n\nThe baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the CABOMETYX and \n\nsunitinib arms. The majority of the patients were male (78%) with a median age of 62 years. Patient \n\ndistribution by IMDC risk groups was 81% intermediate (1-2 risk factors) and 19% poor (≥3 risk \n\nfactors). Most patients (87%) had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; 13% had an ECOG \n\nperformance status of 2. Thirty-six percent (36%) of patients had bone metastases.  \n\n \n\nA statistically significant improvement in PFS as retrospectively assessed by a blinded Independent \n\nRadiology Committee (IRC) was demonstrated for CABOMETYX compared to sunitinib (Figure 3 and \n\nTable 5). The results from the Investigator determined analysis and IRC-determined analysis of PFS \n\nwere consistent.  \n\n \n\nPatients with both positive and negative MET status showed a favourable effect with CABOMETYX \n\ncompared to sunitinib, with greater activity in patients with a positive MET status compared to patients \n\nwith a negative MET status (HR=0.32 (0.16, 0.63) vs 0.67 (0.37, 1.23)) respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nCABOMETYX treatment was associated with a trend for longer survival compared to sunitinib (Table \n\n5).

The Kaplan- Meier estimates for \n\nmedian duration of OS were 11.1 months in the cabozantinib arm versus 6.9 months in the placebo \n\narm, an estimated 4.2-month difference in the medians. \n\n \n\nNon-disease specific quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L. A negative \n\neffect of Cabometyx versus placebo on the EQ-5D utility index score was observed during the first \n\nweeks of treatment. Only limited QoL data are available after this period. \n\n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nCABOMETYX in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, \n\nand kidney and renal pelvis carcinoma (excluding nephroblastoma, nephroblastomatosis, clear cell \n\nsarcoma, mesoblastic nephroma, renal medullary carcinoma and rhabdoid tumour of the kidney) (see \n\nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use).   \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral administration of cabozantinib, peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations are reached \n\nat 3 to 4 hours post-dose. Plasma-concentration time profiles show a second absorption peak \n\napproximately 24 hours after administration, which suggests that cabozantinib may undergo \n\nenterohepatic recirculation. \n\n \n\nRepeat daily dosing of cabozantinib at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in an approximately a 4- to 5-fold \n\nmean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady \n\nstate is achieved by approximately Day 15.   \n\n \n\nA high-fat meal moderately increased Cmax and AUC values (41% and 57%, respectively) relative to \n\nfasted conditions in healthy volunteers administered a single 140 mg oral cabozantinib dose. There is \n\nno information on the precise food-effect when taken 1 hour after administration of cabozantinib. \n\n \n\nBioequivalence could not be demonstrated between the cabozantinib capsule and tablet formulations \n\nfollowing a single 140 mg dose in healthy subjects. A 19% increase in the Cmax of the tablet \n\nformulation (CABOMETYX) compared to the capsule formulation (COMETRIQ) was observed. A \n\nless than 10% difference in the AUC was observed between cabozantinib tablet (CABOMETYX) and \n\ncapsule (COMETRIQ) formulations. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nCabozantinib is highly protein bound in vitro in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Based on the population-\n\npharmacokinetic (PK) model, the volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc/F) was \n\nestimated to be 212 L. Protein binding was not altered in subjects with mild or moderately impaired \n\nrenal or hepatic function. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nCabozantinib was metabolized in vivo. Four metabolites were present in plasma at exposures (AUC) \n\ngreater than 10% of parent: XL184-N-oxide, XL184 amide cleavage product, XL184 monohydroxy \n\nsulfate, and 6-desmethyl amide cleavage product sulfate. Two non-conjugated metabolites (XL184-\n\nN-oxide and XL184 amide cleavage product), which possess <1% of the on-target kinase inhibition \n\npotency of parent cabozantinib, each represent <10% of total drug-related plasma exposure. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nCabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 metabolism in vitro, as a neutralizing antibody to CYP3A4 \n\ninhibited formation of metabolite XL184 N-oxide by >80% in a NADPH-catalyzed human liver \n\nmicrosomal (HLM) incubation; in contrast, neutralizing antibodies to CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, \n\nCYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. A \n\nneutralizing antibody to CYP2C9 showed a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation \n\n(ie, a <20% reduction). \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nIn a population PK analysis of cabozantinib using data collected from 1883 patients and 140 healthy \n\nvolunteers following oral administration of a range of doses from 20 to 140 mg, the plasma terminal \n\nhalf-life of cabozantinib is approximately 110 hours. Mean clearance (CL/F) at steady-state was \n\nestimated to be 2.48 L/hr . Within a 48-day collection period after a single dose of 14C-cabozantinib in \n\nhealthy volunteers, approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered with \n\n54% in faeces and 27% in urine.  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn a renal impairment study conducted with a single 60 mg dose of cabozantinib, the ratios of \n\ngeometric LS mean for plasma cabozantinib, Cmax and AUC0-inf were 19% and 30% higher, for \n\nsubjects with mild renal impairment (90% CI for Cmax 91.60% to 155.51%; AUC0-inf 98.79% to \n\n171.26%) and 2% and 6-7% higher (90% CI for Cmax 78.64% to 133.52%; AUC0-inf 79.61% to \n\n140.11%), for subjects with moderate renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal \n\nfunction.  Subjects with severe renal impairment have not been studied. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on an integrated population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib in healthy subjects and \n\ncancer patients (including HCC), no clinically significant difference in the mean cabozantinib plasma \n\nexposure was observed amongst subjects with normal liver function (n=1425) and mild hepatic \n\nimpairment (n=558). There is limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n=15) as per \n\nNCI-ODWG (National Cancer Institute – Organ Dysfunction working Group) criteria. The \n\npharmacokinetics of cabozantinib was not evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n \n\nRace \n\nA population PK analysis did not identify clinically relevant differences in PK of cabozantinib based \n\non race. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to \n\nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n\n \n\nIn rat and dog repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months duration, target organs for toxicity were GI \n\ntract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal and reproductive tract tissues. The no observed \n\nadverse effect level (NOAEL) for these findings were below human clinical exposure levels at \n\nintended therapeutic dose. \n\n \n\nCabozantinib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in a standard battery of genotoxicity \n\nassays. The carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been evaluated in two species: rasH2 \n\ntransgenic mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, cabozantinib-\n\nrelated neoplastic findings consisted of an increased incidence of benign pheochromocytoma, alone or \n\nin combination with malignant pheochromocytoma/complex malignant pheochromocytoma of the \n\nadrenal medulla in both sexes at exposures well below the intended exposure in humans. The clinical \n\nrelevance of the observed neoplastic lesions in rats is uncertain, but likely to be low. \n\n\n\n25 \n\nCabozantinib was not carcinogenic in the rasH2 mouse model at a slightly higher exposure than the \n\nintended human therapeutic exposure. \n\n \n\nFertility studies in rats have shown reduced male and female fertility. Further, hypospermatogenesis \n\nwas observed in male dogs at exposure levels below human clinical exposure levels at intended \n\ntherapeutic dose.  \n\n \n\nEmbryo-foetal development studies were performed in rats and rabbits. In rats, cabozantinib caused \n\npostimplantation loss, foetal oedema, cleft palate/lip, dermal aplasia and kinked or rudimentary tail. In \n\nrabbits, cabozantinib produced foetal soft tissue changes (reduced spleen size, small or missing \n\nintermediate lung lobe) and increased foetal incidence of total malformations. NOAEL for embryo-\n\nfoetal toxicity and teratogenic findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended \n\ntherapeutic dose.   \n\n \n\nJuvenile rats (comparable to a >2 year- old paediatric population) administered cabozantinib showed \n\nincreased WBC parameters, decreased haematopoiesis, pubescent/immature female reproductive \n\nsystem (without delayed vaginal opening), tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral content and \n\ndensity, liver pigmentation and lymph node lymphoid hyperplasia. Findings in uterus/ovaries and \n\ndecreased haematopoiesis appeared to be transient, while effects on bone parameters and liver \n\npigmentation were sustained. Juvenile rats (correlating to a <2- year paediatric population) showed \n\nsimilar treatment-related findings but appeared to be more sensitive to cabozantinib-related toxicity at \n\ncomparable dose levels. \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What CABOMETYX is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat CABOMETYX is \n\n \n\nCABOMETYX is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance cabozantinib.  \n\nIt is used to treat: \n\n- advanced stages of a type of kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma  \n- liver cancer in adults who have been previously treated with a specific anticancer medicine \n\n(sorafenib).  \n\n \n\nHow CABOMETYX works \n\n \n\nCABOMETYX blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are \n\ninvolved in the growth of cells and the development of new blood vessels that supply them. These \n\nproteins can be present in high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action CABOMETYX \n\ncan slow down the rate at which the tumour grows and help to cut off the blood supply that the cancer \n\nneeds.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take CABOMETYX \n\n \n\nDo not take CABOMETYX \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n- - if you are allergic to cabozantinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking CABOMETYX if you: \n\n \n\n-   have high blood pressure \n\n- have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear \nin a blood vessel wall \n\n-  have diarrhoea \n\n-  have a recent history of significant bleeding \n\n- have had surgery within the last month (or if surgical procedures are planned), including \n\ndental surgery \n\n- have inflammatory bowel disease (for example, Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, \n\ndiverticulitis, or appendicitis) \n\n- have a recent history of blood clot in the leg, stroke, or heart attack \n\n- have liver or kidney disease.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if any of these affect you.  \n\n \n\nYou may need treatment for them, or your doctor may decide to change your dose of CABOMETYX, \n\nor stop treatment altogether. See also section 4 “Possible side effects”. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nCABOMETYX is not recommended for children or adolescents. The effects of CABOMETYX in \n\npeople younger than 18 years old are not known. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and CABOMETYX \n\n \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. This is because CABOMETYX can affect the \n\nway some other medicines work. Also, some medicines can affect the way CABOMETYX works. \n\nThis could mean that your doctor needs to change the dose(s) that you take. You should tell your \n\ndoctor about every medicine, but in particular if taking: \n\n \n\n- Medicines that treat fungal infections, such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole \n- Medicines used to treat bacterial infections (antibiotics) such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, \n\nand rifampicin \n\n- Allergy medicines such as fexofenadine and ranolazine \n- Medicines used to treat epilepsy or fits such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital  \n- Herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), sometimes used for \n\ntreating depression or depression-related conditions such as anxiety \n\n- Medicines used to thin the blood, such as warfarin \n- Medicines to treat high blood pressure or other heart conditions, such as aliskiren, \n\nambrisentan, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, talinolol, and tolvaptan \n\n- Medicines for diabetes, such as saxagliptin and sitagliptin  \n- Medicines used to treat gout, such as colchicine \n- Medicines used to treat HIV or AIDS, such as efavirenz, ritonavir, maraviroc and \n\nemtricitabine \n\n- Medicines used to prevent transplant rejection (ciclosporin) and ciclosporin-based regimens \nin rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nOral contraceptives \n\nIf you take CABOMETYX whilst using oral contraceptives, the oral contraceptives may be \n\nineffective. You should also use a barrier contraceptive (e.g. condom or diaphragm) whilst taking \n\nCABOMETYX and for at least 4 months after treatment has finished. \n\n \n\nTaking CABOMETYX with food \n\n \n\nYou should not take CABOMETYX with food. You should not eat anything for at least 2 hours \n\nbefore taking CABOMETYX and for 1 hour after taking the medicine.
