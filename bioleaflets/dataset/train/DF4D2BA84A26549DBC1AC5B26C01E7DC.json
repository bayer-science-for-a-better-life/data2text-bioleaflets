PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFor the treatment of adults and children with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance \nof normal glucose homeostasis. Humalog is also indicated for the initial stabilisation of diabetes \nmellitus.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the requirement of the patient.  \n \nJunior KwikPen \nHumalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen is suitable for patients who may benefit from finer insulin dose \nadjustments. \n \nHumalog may be given shortly before meals. When necessary Humalog can be given soon after meals.  \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nHumalog takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity (2 to 5 hours) given subcutaneously \nas compared with soluble insulin. This rapid onset of activity allows a Humalog injection (or, in the \ncase of administration by continuous subcutaneous infusion, a Humalog bolus) to be given very close \nto mealtime. The time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or \nat different times in the same individual. The faster onset of action compared to soluble human insulin \nis maintained regardless of injection site. As with all insulin preparations, the duration of action of \nHumalog is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. \n \nHumalog can be used in conjunction with a longer-acting insulin or oral sulphonylurea agents, on the \nadvice of a physician.  \n \nHumalog KwikPens \nHumalog KwikPen is available in two strengths. The Humalog 100 units/ml KwikPen (and Humalog \n200 units/ml KwikPen, see separate SmPC) delivers 1 \u2013 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. \nThe Humalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen delivers 0.5 \u2013 30 units in steps of 0.5 units in a single \ninjection. The number of insulin units is shown in the dose window of the pen regardless of \nstrength and no dose conversion should be done when transferring a patient to a new strength or to a \npen with a different dose step.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for \ngluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown; however, in patients with chronic hepatic \nimpairment, an increase in insulin resistance may lead to increased insulin requirements. \n \nPaediatric population \nHumalog can be used in adolescents and children (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHumalog preparations should be given by subcutaneous injection.  \nThe KwikPen and Junior KwikPen are only suitable for subcutaneous injections. Humalog in \ncartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a Lilly reusable pen or compatible pump \nsystems for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).  \n \nSubcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen. Use of \ninjection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a \nmonth. \n \nWhen administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog to ensure that a \nblood vessel has not been entered. After injection, the site of injection should not be massaged. \nPatients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques. \n \nUse of Humalog in an insulin infusion pump \nFor subcutaneous injection of Humalog using a continuous infusion pump, you may fill the pump \nreservoir from a Humalog 100 units/ml vial. Some pumps are compatible with cartridges that can be \ninserted intact into the pump. \n \nOnly certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro. Before infusing \ninsulin lispro, the pump manufacturer\u2019s instructions should be studied to ascertain the suitability for \nthe particular pump. Use the correct reservoir and catheter for the pump. When filling the pump \nreservoir avoid damaging it by using the correct needle length on the filling system. The infusion set \n(tubing and cannula) should be changed in accordance with the instructions in the product information \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nsupplied with the infusion set. In the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped \nuntil the episode is resolved. If repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur consider the need to \nreduce or stop an insulin infusion. A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in \na rapid rise in glucose levels. If an interruption to insulin flow is suspected, follow the instructions in \nthe pump product literature. When used with an insulin infusion pump, Humalog should not be mixed \nwith any other insulin. \n \nIntravenous administration of insulin \nIf necessary, Humalog may also be administered intravenously, for example: for the control of blood \nglucose levels during ketoacidosis, acute illnesses or during intra and post operative periods. \nHumalog 100 units /ml is available in vials if administration of intravenous injection is necessary.   \n \nIntravenous injection of insulin lispro should be carried out following normal clinical practise for \nintravenous injections, for example by an intravenous bolus or by an infusion system. Frequent \nmonitoring of the blood glucose levels is required. \nInfusion systems at concentrations from 0.1 units/ml to 1.0 units/ml insulin lispro in 0.9% sodium \nchloride or 5% dextrose are stable at room temperature for 48 hours. It is recommended that the \nsystem is primed before starting the infusion to the patient. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypoglycaemia. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin  \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular/soluble, NPH/isophane,  etc.), \nspecies (animal, human, human insulin analogue), and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA \nversus animal-source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage. For fast-acting insulins, \nany patient also on basal insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to obtain glucose control across \nthe whole day, particularly nocturnal/fasting glucose control. \n \nVial \nWhen mixing Humalog with a longer acting insulin, the shorter-acting Humalog should be drawn into \nthe syringe first, to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting insulin. Mixing of the \ninsulins ahead of time or just before the injection should be on advice of the physician. However, a \nconsistent routine must be followed. \n \nHypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia \nConditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less \npronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease or \nmedications such as beta-blockers. \n \nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source \ninsulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less \npronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected \nhypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death. \n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nThe use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-\ndependent diabetics, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are \npotentially lethal. \n \nInsulin requirements and dosage adjustment \nInsulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. \n \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or \nchange their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of \nhypoglycaemia. A consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if \nhypoglycaemia occurs, it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human \ninsulin. \n \nCombination of Humalog with pioglitazone: \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind, if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Humalog is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued, if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of medication errors \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between the two different strengths of Humalog KwikPen as well as other insulin products. \nPatients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the \nrequirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who \nare blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who \nhas good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInsulin requirements may be increased by medicinal products with hyperglycaemic activity, such as \noral contraceptives, corticosteroids, or thyroid replacement therapy, danazol, beta2 stimulants (such as \nritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline).  \n \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of medicinal products with hypoglycaemic \nactivity, such as oral hypoglycaemics, salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid), sulpha \nantibiotics, certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake \ninhibitors), certain angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin II \nreceptor blockers, beta-blockers, octreotide or alcohol.  \n \nThe physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog (see section \n4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nData on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on \npregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn.    \n \nIt is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational \ndiabetes) patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform \n\n\n\n 6 \n\ntheir doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose \ncontrol, as well as general health, is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nPatients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both.  \n \nFertility \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient\u2019s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nHypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes \nmay suffer. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness, and in extreme cases, death. No \nspecific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented, since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin \ndose and other factors e.g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred \nterm by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: \u22651/10; common: \n\u22651/100 to <1/10; uncommon: \u22651/1,000 to <1/100; rare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very \nrare \n\nImmune system disorders  \n\nLocal allergy  X    \n\nSystemic allergy    X  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy   X   \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nLocal allergy  \nLocal allergy in patients is common. Redness, swelling, and itching can occur at the site of insulin \ninjection. This condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks. In some instances, this \ncondition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or \npoor injection technique.  \n \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nSystemic allergy \nSystemic allergy,  which is rare  but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin. It may \ncause a rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast \npulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening. \n \nLipodystrophy \nLipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon. \n \nOedema  \nCases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic \ncontrol is improved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nInsulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of \ncomplex interactions between insulin levels, glucose availability and other metabolic processes. \nHypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy \nexpenditure. \n \nHypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness, confusion, palpitations, headache, sweating and \nvomiting. \n \nMild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or \nsaccharated products. \n \nCorrection of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or \nsubcutaneous administration of glucagon, followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers \nsufficiently. Patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously. \n \nIf the patient is comatose, glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. \nHowever, glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient \nfails to respond to glucagon. The patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is \nrecovered. \n \nSustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur \nafter apparent clinical recovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group : Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \nATC code: A10AB04 \n \nThe primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism. \n \nIn addition, insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues. \nWithin muscle tissue this includes increasing glycogen, fatty acid, glycerol and protein synthesis and \namino acid uptake, while decreasing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, lipolysis, protein \ncatabolism and amino acid output. \n\n\n\n 8 \n\n \nInsulin lispro has a rapid onset of action (approximately 15 minutes), thus allowing it to be given \ncloser to a meal (within zero to 15 minutes of the meal) when compared to soluble insulin (30 to \n45 minutes before). Insulin lispro takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity (2 to \n5 hours) when compared to soluble insulin.  \n \nClinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial \nhyperglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin.  \n \nAs with all insulin preparations, the time course of insulin lispro action may vary in different \nindividuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on dose, site of injection, \nblood supply, temperature and physical activity. The typical activity profile following subcutaneous \ninjection is illustrated below. \n \n\n \n \nThe above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the \nsubject's whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of \nthese insulins on glucose metabolism over time. \n \nClinical trials have been performed in children (61 patients aged 2 to 11) and children and adolescents \n(481 patients aged 9 to 19 years), comparing insulin lispro to human soluble insulin. The \npharmacodynamic profile of insulin lispro in children is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nWhen used in subcutaneous infusion pumps, treatment with insulin lispro has been shown to result in \nlower glycosylated haemoglobin levels compared to soluble insulin.  In a double-blind, crossover \nstudy, the reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin levels after 12 weeks dosing was 0.37 percentage \npoints with insulin lispro, compared to 0.03 percentage points for soluble insulin (p = 0.004). \n \nIn patients with type 2 diabetes on maximum doses of sulphonyl urea agents, studies have shown that \nthe addition of insulin lispro significantly reduces HbA1c compared to sulphonyl urea alone. The \nreduction of HbA1c would also be expected with other insulin products e.g. soluble or isophane \ninsulins. \n \nClinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a reduced number of \nepisodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin. In some \nstudies, reduction of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was associated with increased episodes of daytime \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nThe glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment. \nGlucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin, as measured during a \nglucose clamp procedure, were maintained over a wide range of renal function.  \n \nInsulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more \nrapid and of a shorter duration. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed, and achieves peak \nblood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection. When considering the clinical \nrelevance of these kinetics, it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves (as \ndiscussed in 5.1). \n \nInsulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients \nwith renal impairment. In patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the \npharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally \nmaintained and shown to be independent of renal function.  Insulin lispro maintains more rapid \nabsorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn in vitro tests, including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells, insulin lispro \nbehaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that the \ndissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin. Acute, \none month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings. \n \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies.  \n \n \n6.

Not all packs may be \nmarketed \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nInstructions for use and handling \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge or pen must be used by one patient \nonly, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed.  Patients using vials must never share \nneedles or syringes. The patient should discard the needle after every injection. \n \nThe Humalog solution should be clear and colourless. Humalog should not be used if it appears \ncloudy, thickened, or slightly coloured or if solid particles are visible. \n \nDo not mix insulin in vials with insulin in cartridges. See section 6.2. \n \nPreparing a dose \n \nVial \nThe vial is to be used in conjunction with an appropriate syringe (100 unit markings). \n \ni) Humalog \n1. Wash your hands.  \n \n2. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic protective cap, but do not remove the stopper.   \n \n3. If the therapeutic regimen requires the injection of basal insulin and Humalog at the same time, \n\nthe two can be mixed in the syringe. If mixing insulins, refer to the instructions for mixing that \nfollow in Section (ii) and 6.2.  \n\n \n4. Draw air into the syringe equal to the prescribed Humalog dose. Wipe the top of the vial with a \n\nswab. Put the needle through the rubber top of the Humalog vial and inject the air into the vial.  \n \n5. Turn the vial and syringe upside down. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand. \n \n6. Making sure the tip of the needle is in the Humalog, withdraw the correct dose into the syringe.  \n \n7. Before removing the needle from the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles that reduce the \n\namount of Humalog in it. If bubbles are present, hold the syringe straight up and tap its side \nuntil the bubbles float to the top. Push them out with the plunger and withdraw the correct dose.  \n\n \n8. Remove the needle from the vial and lay the syringe down so that the needle does not touch \n\nanything. \n \nii) Mixing Humalog with longer-acting Human Insulins (see section 6.2) \n \n1. Humalog should be mixed with longer-acting human insulins only on the advice of a doctor. \n \n2. Draw air into the syringe equal to the amount of longer-acting insulin being taken. Insert the \n\nneedle into the longer-acting insulin vial and inject the air. Withdraw the needle.  \n \n3. Now inject air into the Humalog vial in the same manner, but do not withdraw the needle.  \n \n4. Turn the vial and syringe upside down.  \n \n5. Making sure the tip of the needle is in the Humalog, withdraw the correct dose of Humalog into \n\nthe syringe.  \n \n6. Before removing the needle from the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles that reduce the \n\namount of Humalog in it. If bubbles are present, hold the syringe straight up and tap its side \nuntil the bubbles float to the top. Push them out with the plunger and withdraw the correct dose.  \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n \n7. Remove the needle from the vial of Humalog and insert it into the vial of the longer-acting \n\ninsulin. Turn the vial and syringe upside down. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand and \nshake gently. Making sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin, withdraw the dose of longer-\nacting insulin. \n\n \n8. Withdraw the needle and lay the syringe down so that the needle does not touch anything. \n \nCartridge \nHumalog cartridges are to be used with a Lilly reusable insulin pen and should not be used with any \nother reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has not been established with other pens. \n \nThe instructions with each individual pen must be followed for loading the cartridge, attaching the \nneedle and administering the insulin injection. \n \nKwikPen and Junior KwikPen \nBefore using the pre-filled pen the user manual included in the package leaflet must be read carefully.  \nThe pre-filled pen has to be used as recommended in the user manual.  \n \nPens should not be used if any part looks broken or damaged. \n \nInjecting a dose \n \nIf using a pre-filled or reusable pen refer to the detailed instructions for preparing the pen and injecting \nthe dose, the following is a general description. \n  \n1. Wash your hands \n \n2. Choose a site for injection. \n \n3. Clean the skin as instructed. \n \n4. Stabilise the skin by spreading it or pinching up a large area. Insert the needle and inject as \n\ninstructed. \n \n5. Pull the needle out and apply gentle pressure over the injection site for several seconds. Do not \n\nrub the area. \n \n6. Dispose of the syringe and needle safely. For an injection device use the outer needle cap, \n\nunscrew the needle and dispose of it safely. \n \n7. Use of the injection sites should be rotated so that the same is not used more than approximately \n\nonce a month. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n7.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nWhite suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHumalog Mix25 is indicated for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus who require insulin \nfor the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the requirement of the patient. \n \nHumalog Mix25 may be given shortly before meals. When necessary, Humalog Mix25 can be given \nsoon after meals. Humalog Mix25 should only be given by subcutaneous injection. Under no \ncircumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously. \n \nThe rapid onset and early peak of activity of Humalog itself is observed following the subcutaneous \nadministration of Humalog Mix25. This allows Humalog Mix25 to be given very close to mealtime. \nThe duration of action of the insulin lispro protamine suspension component of Humalog Mix25 is \nsimilar to that of a basal insulin (NPH). \n \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nThe time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different \ntimes in the same individual. As with all insulin preparations, the duration of action of Humalog \nMix25 is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for \ngluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown; however, in patients with chronic hepatic \nimpairment, an increase in insulin resistance may lead to increased insulin requirements. \n \nPaediatric population \nAdministration of Humalog Mix25 to children below 12 years of age should be considered only in \ncase of an expected benefit when compared to soluble insulin. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSubcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen.  Use of \ninjection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a \nmonth. \n \nWhen administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog Mix25 to ensure \nthat a blood vessel has not been entered. After injection, the site of injection should not be massaged. \nPatients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques. \n \nKwikPen \nThe KwikPen delivers 1 \u2013 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. The needed dose is dialled in \nunits. The number of units is shown in the dose window of the pen.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypoglycaemia. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nUnder no circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously. \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin  \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular/soluble, NPH/isophane, etc.), \nspecies (animal, human, human insulin analogue), and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA \nversus animal-source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage.  \n \nHypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia \nConditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less \npronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease or \nmedications such as beta-blockers. \n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source \ninsulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less \npronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected \nhypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death. \n \nThe use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-\ndependent diabetics, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are \npotentially lethal. \n \nInsulin requirements and dosage adjustment \nInsulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. \n \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or \nchange their usual diet.  Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nCombination of Humalog Mix25 with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind, if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Humalog Mix25 is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued, if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of medication errors \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between the two different strengths of Humalog KwikPen as well as other insulin products. \nPatients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the \nrequirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who \nare blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who \nhas good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInsulin requirements may be increased by substances with hyperglycaemic activity, such as oral \ncontraceptives, corticosteroids, or thyroid replacement therapy, danazol, beta2 stimulants (such as \nritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline).  \n \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of substances with hypoglycaemic activity, such \nas oral hypoglycaemics, salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid), sulphate antibiotics, certain \nantidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), certain \nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-\nblockers, octreotide or alcohol.  \n \nMixing Humalog Mix25 with other insulins has not been studied. \n \nThe physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog Mix25 (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nData on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on \npregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn.    \n\n\n\n 17 \n\n \nIt is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational \ndiabetes) patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform \ntheir doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose \ncontrol, as well as general health, is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nPatients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both.  \n \nFertility \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient\u2019s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nHypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes \nmay suffer. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness, and in extreme cases, death. No \nspecific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented, since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin \ndose and other factors e.g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred \nterm by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: \u22651/10; common: \n\u22651/100 to <1/10; uncommon: \u22651/1,000 to <1/100; rare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very \nrare \n\nImmune system disorders  \n\nLocal allergy  X    \n\nSystemic allergy    X  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy   X   \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nLocal allergy  \nLocal allergy in patients is common . Redness, swelling, and itching can occur at the site of insulin \ninjection. This condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks. In some instances, this \n\n\n\n 18 \n\ncondition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or \npoor injection technique.  \n \nSystemic allergy \nSystemic allergy,  which is rare but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin. It may \ncause a rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast \npulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening. \n \nLipodystrophy \nLipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon . \n \nOedema  \nCases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic \ncontrol is improved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nInsulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of \ncomplex interactions between insulin levels, glucose availability and other metabolic processes.  \nHypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy \nexpenditure. \n \nHypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness, confusion, palpitations, headache, sweating and \nvomiting. \n \nMild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or \nsaccharated products. \n \nCorrection of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or \nsubcutaneous administration of glucagon, followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers \nsufficiently.  Patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously. \n \nIf the patient is comatose, glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.  \nHowever, glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient \nfails to respond to glucagon. The patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered. \n \nSustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur \nafter apparent clinical recovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate \nor long acting combined with fast acting. ATC Code: A10A D04. \n \nThe primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism. \n \nIn addition, insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues.  \nWithin muscle tissue this includes increasing glycogen, fatty acid, glycerol and protein synthesis and \n\n\n\n 19 \n\namino acid uptake, while decreasing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, lipolysis, protein \ncatabolism and amino acid output. \n \nInsulin lispro has a rapid onset of action (approximately 15 minutes), thus allowing it to be given \ncloser to a meal (within zero to 15 minutes of the meal) when compared to soluble insulin (30 to 45 \nminutes before). The rapid onset and early peak of activity of insulin lispro is observed following the \nsubcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix25.  Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very \nsimilar to that of a basal insulin (NPH) over a period of approximately 15 hours.  \n \nClinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial \nhyperglycaemia with Humalog Mix25 compared to human insulin mixture 30/70. In one clinical study \nthere was a small (0.38 mmol/l) increase in blood glucose levels at night (3a.m.). \n \nIn the figure below the pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix25 and BASAL are illustrated. \n\n \nThe above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the \nsubject's whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of \nthese insulins on glucose metabolism over time. \n \nThe glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment. \nGlucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin, as measured during a \nglucose clamp procedure, were maintained over a wide range of renal function.  \n \nInsulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more \nrapid and of a shorter duration. \n \nIn two 8-month open label crossover studies, type 2 diabetes patients who were either new to insulin \ntherapy or already using one or two injections of insulin, received 4 months of treatment with \nHumalog Mix25 (used twice daily with metformin) and insulin glargine (used once daily with \nmetformin) in a randomised sequence. Detailed information can be found in the following table. \n \n\n \n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 \n\nHumalog Mix25 \nHumalog Basal \n\n \n Time, hours \n\nHypoglycemic Activity \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n Insulin-Naive Patients \nn = 78 \n\nNot Insulin-Naive Patients \nn = 97 \n\nMean total daily insulin dose at endpoint 0.63 units/kg 0.42 units/kg \nHaemoglobin A1c \u2013Reduction\n\n1\n  1.30% \n\n(mean at baseline = 8.7%) \n1.00 % \n\n(mean at baseline = 8.5%) \nReduction of the mean of combined \nmorning / evening two-hour postprandial \nblood glucose\n\n1\n  \n\n3.46 mM \n \n\n2.48 mM \n \n\nReduction of the mean fasting blood \nglucose\n\n1\n  \n\n0.55 mM \n \n\n0.65 mM \n \n\nIncidence of hypoglycaemia at endpoint 25% 25% \nBodyweight gain2 2.33 kg 0.96 kg \n\n1 from baseline to end of Humalog Mix25 treatment \n2 in patients randomised to Humalog Mix25 during the first crossover period \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed, and achieves peak \nblood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection. The pharmacokinetics of insulin \nlispro protamine suspension are consistent with those of an intermediate acting insulin such as NPH. \nThe pharmacokinetics of Humalog Mix25 are representative of the individual pharmacokinetic \nproperties of the two components. When considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics, it is more \nappropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves (as discussed in 5.1). \n \nInsulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients \nwith renal impairment. In patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function  the \npharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally \nmaintained and shown to be independent of renal function.  Insulin lispro maintains more rapid \nabsorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn in vitro tests, including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells, insulin lispro \nbehaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin.  Studies also demonstrate that the \ndissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin.  Acute, \none month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings. \n \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies.  \n \n6.

Dimeticone or silicone emulsion may have been used to treat the vial \nstoppers.  \n \n10 ml Vial: Pack of 1. Not all packs may be marketed. \n \nCartridge \nThe suspension is contained in type I flint glass cartridges, sealed with butyl or halobutyl disc seals and \nplunger heads and secured with aluminium seals. Dimeticone or silicone emulsion may have been used \nto treat the cartridge plunger, and/or the glass cartridge. \n \n3 ml Cartridge: Packs of 5 or 10. Not all packs may be marketed. \n \nKwikPen \nThe suspension is contained in type I flint glass cartridges, sealed with halobutyl disc seals and \nplunger heads and secured with aluminium seals.  Dimeticone or silicone emulsion may have been \nused to treat the cartridge plunger, and/or the glass cartridge. The 3 ml cartridges are sealed in a \ndisposable pen injector, called the \u201cKwikPen\u201d.  Needles are not included. \n \n3 ml KwikPen: Packs of 5 or a multipack of 10 (2 packs of 5). Not all packs may be marketed. \n \n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nInstructions for use and handling \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge or pen must be used by one patient \nonly, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed.  Patients using vials must never share \nneedles or syringes. The patient should discard the needle after every injection. \n \nThe Humalog Mix25 should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are \npresent or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the container, giving it a frosted \nappearance. \n \nPreparing a dose \n \nVials containing Humalog Mix25 should be rotated in the palms of the hands before use to resuspend \nthe insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky. Cartridges and KwikPens containing Humalog \nMix25 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180\u00b0 ten times immediately \nbefore use to resuspend the insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky.   \n \nIf not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed.  Cartridges contain a small glass bead to \nassist mixing.  \n \nDo not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement \nof the dose.  \n \nVial \nThe vial is to be used in conjunction with an appropriate syringe (100 unit markings). \n \n1. Wash your hands.  \n \n2. If using a new vial, flip off the plastic protective cap, but do not remove the stopper.    \n \n3. Draw air into the syringe equal to the prescribed Humalog Mix25 dose.  Wipe the top of the vial \n\nwith a swab.  Put the needle through rubber top of the Humalog Mix25 vial and inject the air \ninto the vial.  \n\n \n4. Turn the vial and syringe upside down. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand. \n \n5. Making sure the tip of the needle is in the Humalog Mix25, withdraw the correct dose into the \n\nsyringe.  \n \n6. Before removing the needle from the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles that reduce the \n\namount of Humalog Mix25 in it. If bubbles are present, hold the syringe straight up and tap its \nside until the bubbles float to the top. Push them out with the plunger and withdraw the correct \ndose.  \n\n \n7. Remove the needle from the vial and lay the syringe down so that the needle does not touch \n\nanything. \n \nCartridge \nHumalog Mix25 cartridges are to be used with a Lilly reusable insulin pen and should not be used \nwith any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has not been established with other pens. \n \nThe instructions with each individual pen must be followed for loading the cartridge, attaching the \nneedle and administering the insulin injection. \n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nKwikPen \nBefore using the KwikPen the user manual included in the package leaflet must be read carefully.  The \nKwikPen has to be used as recommended in the user manual. \n \nPens should not be used if any part looks broken or damaged. \n \nInjecting a dose \n \nIf using a pre-filled or reusable pen refer to the detailed instructions for preparing the pen and injecting \nthe dose, the following is a general description. \n \n1. Wash your hands \n \n2. Choose a site for injection. \n \n3. Clean the skin as instructed. \n \n4. Stabilise the skin by spreading it or pinching up a large area.  Insert the needle and inject as \n\ninstructed. \n \n5. Pull the needle out and apply gentle pressure over the injection site for several seconds. Do not \n\nrub the area. \n \n6. Dispose of the syringe and needle safely. For an injection device use the outer needle cap, \n\nunscrew the needle and dispose of it safely. \n \n7. Use of the injection sites should be rotated so that the same is not used more than approximately \n\nonce a month. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular/soluble, NPH/isophane, etc.), \nspecies (animal, human, human insulin analogue), and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA \nversus animal-source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage. \n \nHypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia \nConditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less \npronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease or \nmedications such as beta-blockers. \n \nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source \ninsulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less \npronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected \nhypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death. \n\n\n\n 26 \n\n \nThe use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-\ndependent diabetics, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are \npotentially lethal. \n \nInsulin requirements and dosage adjustment  \nInsulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. \n \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change \ntheir usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n \nCombination of Humalog Mix50 with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind, if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Humalog Mix50 is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued, if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of medication errors \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between the two different strengths of Humalog KwikPen as well as other insulin products. \nPatients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the \nrequirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who \nare blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who \nhas good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInsulin requirements may be increased by substances with hyperglycaemic activity, such as oral \ncontraceptives, corticosteroids, or thyroid replacement therapy, danazol, beta2 stimulants (such as \nritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline).  \n \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of substances with hypoglycaemic activity, such \nas oral hypoglycaemics, salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid), sulpha antibiotics, certain \nantidepressants, (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), certain \nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-\nblockers, octreotide or alcohol.  \n \nMixing Humalog Mix50 with other insulins has not been studied. \n \nThe physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog Mix50 (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nData on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on \npregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn.    \n \nIt is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational \ndiabetes) patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform \n\n\n\n 27 \n\ntheir doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose \ncontrol, as well as general health, is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nPatients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both.  \n \nFertility \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient\u2019s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or \noperating machinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nHypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes \nmay suffer. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness, and in extreme cases, death. No \nspecific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented, since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin \ndose and other factors e.g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred \nterm by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: \u22651/10; common: \n\u22651/100 to <1/10; uncommon: \u22651/1,000 to <1/100; rare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very \nrare \n\nImmune system disorders  \n\nLocal allergy  X    \n\nSystemic allergy    X  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy   X   \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nLocal allergy  \nLocal allergy in patients is common . Redness, swelling, and itching can occur at the site of insulin \ninjection. This condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks. In some instances, this \ncondition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or \npoor injection technique.  \n \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nSystemic allergy \nSystemic allergy,  which is rare  but potentially more serious, is a generalised allergy to insulin. It may \ncause a rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast \npulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening. \n \nLipodystrophy \nLipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon . \n \nOedema  \nCases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic \ncontrol is improved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nInsulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of \ncomplex interactions between insulin levels, glucose availability and other metabolic processes.  \nHypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy \nexpenditure. \n \nHypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness, confusion, palpitations, headache, sweating and \nvomiting. \n \nMild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or \nsaccharated products. \n \nCorrection of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or \nsubcutaneous administration of glucagon, followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers \nsufficiently.  Patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously. \n \nIf the patient is comatose, glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously.  \nHowever, glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient \nfails to respond to glucagon.  The patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered. \n \nSustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur \nafter apparent clinical recovery. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, intermediate \nor long acting combined with fast acting. ATC Code: A10A D04. \n \nThe primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism. \n \nIn addition, insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues.  \nWithin muscle tissue this includes increasing glycogen, fatty acid, glycerol and protein synthesis and \namino acid uptake, while decreasing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, lipolysis, protein \ncatabolism and amino acid output. \n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nInsulin lispro has a rapid onset of action (approximately 15 minutes), thus allowing it to be given closer \nto a meal (within zero to 15 minutes of the meal) when compared to soluble insulin (30 to 45 minutes \nbefore). The rapid onset and early peak of activity of insulin lispro is observed following the \nsubcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix50. Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very \nsimilar to that of a basal insulin (NPH) over a period of approximately 15 hours.  In the figure below \nthe pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix50 and BASAL are illustrated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHypoglycaemic  \nactivity \n\n \n                         Time, hours \n \n\n \n \nThe above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the \nsubject's whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of \nthese insulins on glucose metabolism over time. \n \nThe glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment. \nGlucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin, as measured during a \nglucose clamp procedure, were maintained over a wide range of renal function.  \n \nInsulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more \nrapid and of a shorter duration. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed, and achieves peak \nblood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection. The pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro \nprotamine suspension are consistent with those of an intermediate acting insulin such as NPH. The \npharmacokinetics of Humalog Mix50 are representative of the individual pharmacokinetic properties \nof the two components. When considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics, it is more \nappropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves (as discussed in 5.1). \n \nInsulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients \nwith renal impairment. In patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function  the \npharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally \nmaintained and shown to be independent of renal function.  Insulin lispro maintains more rapid \nabsorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 \n\nHumalog Mix50 \nHumalog Basal \n\n\n\n 30 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn in vitro tests, including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells, insulin lispro \nbehaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that the \ndissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro  is equivalent to human insulin. Acute, \none month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings. \n \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies.  \n \n \n6.

Dimeticone or silicone emulsion may have been \nused to treat the cartridge plunger, and/or the glass cartridge.   \n \n3 ml Cartridge: Packs of 5 or 10. Not all packs may be marketed. \n \nKwikPen \nThe suspension is contained in type I flint glass cartridges, sealed with halobutyl disc seals and \nplunger heads and secured with aluminium seals.  Dimeticone or silicone emulsion may have been \nused to treat the cartridge plunger, and/or the glass cartridge. The 3 ml cartridges are sealed in a \ndisposable pen injector, called the \u201cKwikPen\u201d.  Needles are not included. \n3 ml KwikPen: Packs of 5 or a multipack of 10 (2 packs of 5). Not all packs may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nInstructions for use and handling \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge or pen must be used by one patient \nonly, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed. The patient should discard the needle after \nevery injection. \n \nThe Humalog Mix50 should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are \npresent or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the container, giving it a frosted \nappearance. \n \nPreparing a dose \n \nCartridges  or KwikPens containing Humalog Mix50 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten \ntimes and inverted 180\u00b0 ten times immediately before use to resuspend the insulin until it appears \nuniformly cloudy or milky.  If not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed.  Cartridges \ncontain a small glass bead to assist mixing.   \n \nDo not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement \nof the dose. \n \nCartridge \nHumalog Mix50 cartridges are to be used with a Lilly reusable insulin pen and should not be used \nwith any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has not been established with other pens. \n \nThe instructions with each individual pen must be followed for loading the cartridge, attaching the \nneedle and administering the insulin injection. \n \nKwikPen \nBefore using the KwikPen the user manual included in the package leaflet must be read carefully.  The \nKwikPen has to be used as recommended in the user manual. \n \nPens should not be used if any part looks broken or damaged. \n \nInjecting a dose \nIf using a pre-filled or reusable pen refer to the detailed instructions for preparing the pen and injecting \nthe dose, the following is a general description. \n \n1. Wash your hands. \n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\n2. Choose a site for injection. \n \n3. Clean the skin as instructed. \n \n4. Stabilise the skin by spreading it or pinching up a large area.  Insert the needle and inject as \n\ninstructed. \n \n5. Pull the needle out and apply gentle pressure over the injection site for several seconds.  Do not \n\nrub the area. \n \n6. Using the outer needle cap, unscrew the needle and dispose of it safely. \n \n7. Use of injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately \n\nonce a month. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen, solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 200 units insulin lispro*(equivalent to 6.9 mg).  \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 600 units of insulin lispro in 3 ml solution. \n \nEach KwikPen delivers 1-60 units in steps of 1 unit. \n \n* produced in E.coli by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection.  \n \nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFor the treatment of adults with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal \nglucose homeostasis. Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is also indicated for the initial stabilisation of \ndiabetes mellitus.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dosage should be determined by the physician, according to the requirement of the patient.  \n \nHumalog may be given shortly before meals. When necessary Humalog can be given soon after meals.  \n \nHumalog takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity (2 to 5 hours) given subcutaneously \nas compared with soluble insulin. This rapid onset of activity allows a Humalog injection to be given \nvery close to mealtime. The time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different \nindividuals or at different times in the same individual. The faster onset of action compared to soluble \nhuman insulin is maintained regardless of injection site. The duration of action of Humalog is \ndependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. \n \nHumalog can be used in conjunction with a longer-acting insulin or oral sulphonylurea medicinal \nproducts, on the advice of a physician.  \n \nHumalog KwikPens \nHumalog KwikPen is available in two strengths.The Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen (and Humalog \n100 units/ml KwikPen, see separate SmPC) delivers 1 \u2013 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. \nThe number of insulin units is shown in the dose window of the pen regardless of strength and no \ndose conversion should be done when transferring a patient to a new strength or to a pen with a \ndifferent dose step.  \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen should be reserved for the treatment of patients with diabetes \nrequiring daily doses of more than 20 units of rapid-acting insulin. The insulin lispro solution \ncontaining 200 units/ml should not be withdrawn from the pre-filled pen (the KwikPen) or mixed with \nany other insulin (see section 4.4 and section 6.2). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for \ngluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown; however, in patients with chronic hepatic \nimpairment, an increase in insulin resistance may lead to increased insulin requirements. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHumalog solution for injection should be given subcutaneously.  \n \nSubcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen. Use of \ninjection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a \nmonth. \n \nWhen administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog to ensure that a \nblood vessel has not been entered. After injection, the site of injection should not be massaged. \nPatients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques. \n \nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection should not be used in an insulin infusion pump. \n \nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection should not be used intravenously. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypoglycaemia. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin  \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular/soluble, NPH/isophane, etc.), \nspecies (animal, human, human insulin analogue), and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA \nversus animal-source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage. For fast-acting insulins, \nany patient also on basal insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to obtain glucose control across \nthe whole day, particularly nocturnal/fasting glucose control. \n \nHypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia \nConditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less \npronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease or \nmedicinal products such as beta-blockers. \n \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source \ninsulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less \npronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected \nhypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death. \n \nThe use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-\ndependent diabetics, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are \npotentially lethal. \n \nInsulin requirements and dosage adjustment \nInsulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or \nchange their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of \nhypoglycaemia. A consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if \nhypoglycaemia occurs, it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human \ninsulin. \n \nCombination of Humalog with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind, if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Humalog is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued, if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nAvoidance of medication errors when using insulin lispro (200 units/ml) in pre-filled pen: \nThe insulin lispro solution for injection containing 200 units/ml must not be transferred from the pre-\nfilled pen, the KwikPen, to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will not measure the dose \ncorrectly. Overdose can result causing severe hypoglycemia.  The insulin lispro solution for injection \ncontaining 200 units/ml must not be transferred from the KwikPen to any other insulin delivery \ndevice, including insulin infusion pumps. \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between the two different strengths of Humalog as well as other insulin products. \n \nPatients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the \nrequirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who \nare blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who \nhas good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInsulin requirements may be increased by medicinal products with hyperglycaemic activity, such as \noral contraceptives, corticosteroids, or thyroid replacement therapy, danazol, beta2 stimulants (such as \nritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline).  \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of medicinal products with hypoglycaemic \nactivity, such as oral hypoglycemics, salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid), sulpha antibiotics, \ncertain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), certain \nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-\nblockers, octreotide or alcohol.  \n \nThe physician should be consulted when using other medicinal products in addition to Humalog \n200 units/ml KwikPen (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 36 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nData on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on \npregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn.   \n \nIt is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational \ndiabetes) patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and \nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform \ntheir doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose \ncontrol, as well as general health, is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nPatients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both.  \n \nFertility \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient\u2019s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using \nmachines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nHypoglycaemia is the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin lispro therapy that a patient with \ndiabetes may suffer. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness, and in extreme cases, \ndeath. No specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented, since hypoglycaemia is a result of both \nthe insulin dose and other factors e.g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred \nterm by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: \u22651/10; common: \n\u22651/100 to <1/10; uncommon: \u22651/1,000 to <1/100; rare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very \nrare \n\nImmune system disorders  \n\nLocal allergy  X    \n\nSystemic allergy    X  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy   X   \n\n \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nLocal allergy  \nLocal allergy in patients is common).

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nInsulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of \ncomplex interactions between insulin levels, glucose availability and other metabolic processes. \nHypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy \nexpenditure. \n \nHypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness, confusion, palpitations, headache, sweating and \nvomiting. \n \nMild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or \nsaccharated products. \n \nCorrection of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or \nsubcutaneous administration of glucagon, followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers \nsufficiently.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group : Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \nATC code: A10AB04 \n\n\n\n 38 \n\n \nThe primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism. \n \nIn addition, insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues. \nWithin muscle tissue this includes increasing glycogen, fatty acid, glycerol and protein synthesis and \namino acid uptake, while decreasing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, lipolysis, protein \ncatabolism and amino acid output. \n \nInsulin lispro has a rapid onset of action (approximately 15 minutes), thus allowing it to be given \ncloser to a meal (within zero to 15 minutes of the meal) when compared to soluble insulin  \n(30 to 45 minutes before). Insulin lispro takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity (2 to \n5 hours) when compared to soluble insulin.  \n \nClinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial \nhyperglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin.  \nThe time course of insulin lispro action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the \nsame individual and is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature and physical \nactivity. The typical activity profile following subcutaneous injection is illustrated below. \n \nFigure 1: \n\n \n \nThe above representation (figure 1) reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to \nmaintain the subject's whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the \neffect of these insulins (100 units/ml) on glucose metabolism over time. \n \nThe pharmacodynamic responses of insulin lispro 200 units/ml solution for injection were similar to \nthose for insulin lispro 100 units/ml solution for injection after subcutaneous administration of a single \n20 unit dose in healthy subjects as shown in the graph below (figure 2). \n\n\n\n 39 \n\n \nFigure 2: Arithmetic mean glucose infusion rate versus time profiles following subcutaneous \nadministration of 20 units of insulin lispro 200 units/ml or insulin lispro 100 units/ml \n \nIn patients with type 2 diabetes on maximum doses of sulphonyl urea agents, studies have shown that \nthe addition of insulin lispro significantly reduces HbA1c compared to sulphonyl urea alone. The \nreduction of HbA1c would also be expected with other insulin products e.g. soluble or isophane \ninsulins. \n \nClinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a reduced number of \nepisodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin. In some \nstudies, reduction of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was associated with increased episodes of daytime \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nThe glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment. \nGlucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin, as measured during a \nglucose clamp procedure, were maintained over a wide range of renal function. \n \nInsulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more \nrapid and of a shorter duration. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed, and achieves peak \nblood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection. When considering the clinical \nrelevance of these kinetics, it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves (as \ndiscussed in 5.1). \n \nInsulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients \nwith renal impairment. In patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the \npharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally \nmaintained and shown to be independent of renal function.  Insulin lispro maintains more rapid \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \n0 \n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nTime (hr) \n\nGlucose \n\nInfusion \n\nRate \n\n(mg/min) \n\nInsulin lispro 200 units/ml \nInsulin lispro 100 units/ml \n\n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nabsorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nInsulin lispro 200 units/ml solution for injection was bioequivalent to insulin lispro 100 units/ml \nsolution for injection after subcutaneous administration of a single 20 unit dose in healthy subjects. \nTime to maximum concentration was also similar between formulations.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn in vitro tests, including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells, insulin lispro \nbehaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate that the \ndissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin. Acute, \none month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings. \n \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n 102 \n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nHumalog 100 units/ml, solution for injection in vial \ninsulin lispro \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Humalog is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog \n3. How to use Humalog \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog is and what it is used for  \n \nHumalog is used to treat diabetes. Humalog works more quickly than normal human insulin because \nthe insulin molecule has been changed slightly. \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your \nblood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It \nworks very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally \nuse Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of insulin \ncomes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin unless \nyour doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. \n \nHumalog is suitable for use in adults and children.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog  \n \nDo NOT use Humalog \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how \n\nto deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog than you need). \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel \n\nthe warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later \nin this leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise \nand how much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing \nyour blood glucose often. \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human \ninsulin have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you \noften have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\n\n 103 \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes \nnurse \n\n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n- Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. \n\nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and \nmeals at different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke \nwho were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. \nInform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual \nshortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics,  \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 octreotide,  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201d (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers, or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol,  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 angiotensin II receptor blockers. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you \nhave: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Humalog \n \nAlways check the pack and the vial label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it \nfrom your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog that your doctor has told you to use. \n\n\n\n 104 \n\n \nAlways use Humalog exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \nare not sure. \n \nDosage \n\uf0b7 You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject \n\nsoon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, \nand how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes \nclinic regularly. \n\n\uf0b7 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\uf0b7 Inject Humalog under the skin. You should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told \nyou to. \n\n \nPreparing Humalog \n\uf0b7 Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if \n\nit looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time \nyou inject yourself. \n\n \nInjecting Humalog \n\uf0b7 First wash your hands. \n\uf0b7 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Clean the rubber \n\nstopper on the vial, but do not remove the stopper. \n\uf0b7 Use a clean, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of \n\nHumalog you want. Your doctor or clinic will tell you how to do this. Do not share your \nneedles and syringes. \n\n\uf0b7 Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, \nleave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do \nnot rub the area you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from \nthe last injection and that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn\u2019t \nmatter which injection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog \ninjection will still work quicker than soluble human insulin. \n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix Humalog with one of the human insulins. For \nexample if you do need to inject a mixture, draw the Humalog into the syringe before the long \nacting insulin. Inject the liquid as soon as you have mixed it. Do the same thing every time. You \nshould not normally mix Humalog with one of the mixtures of human insulins. You should \nnever mix Humalog with insulins produced by other manufacturers or animal insulins. \n\n\uf0b7 You must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route. Inject Humalog as your physician \nor nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route. \nHe will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your \nglucose levels are too high. \n\n \nUsing Humalog in an infusion pump \n\uf0b7 Only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro. Before \n\ninfusing insulin lispro, the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the \nsuitability or otherwise for the particular pump. Read and follow the instructions in the product \nliterature supplied with the infusion pump. \n\n\uf0b7 Be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump. \n\uf0b7 Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in \n\nthe product information supplied with the infusion set. \n\uf0b7 In the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped until the episode is \n\nresolved. If repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur, notify your doctor or clinic and \nconsider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion. \n\n\n\n 105 \n\n\uf0b7 A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels. \nIf an interruption to insulin flow is suspected, follow the instructions in the product literature \nand if appropriate, notify your doctor or clinic. \n\n\uf0b7 When used with an insulin infusion pump, Humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin. \n \nIf you take more Humalog than you need \nIf you take more Humalog than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar. \n \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even \ndeath (see A and B in section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d).  \n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you stop using Humalog. \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin \nunless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSystemic allergy is rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating. \nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, tell your doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (\uf0b3 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the \narea of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this \nhappens to you, tell your doctor. \n \nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you notice \nyour skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\n\n\n 106 \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nA.  Hypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness                       \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness   \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache                        \u2022 cold sweat. \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nB.  Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy  \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face   \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst    \u2022 feeling or being sick \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. \n \nC.  Illness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Humalog \n \nBefore the first use store your Humalog in a refrigerator (2\uf0b0C \u2013 8\uf0b0C). Do not freeze. Keep your vial in \nuse in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C) or at room temperature up to 30\u00b0C and discard after 28 days. Do not \nput it near heat or in the sun.  \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \n\n\n\n 107 \n\nDo not use this medicine if you notice it is coloured or it has solid pieces in it. You must use it only if \nit looks like water. Check this each time you inject yourself. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \nWhat Humalog 100 units/ml solution for injection in vial contains \n- The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a \u2018recombinant \n\nDNA technology\u2019 process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other \nhuman and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural \nhormone made by the pancreas. \n\n- The other ingredients are m-cresol, glycerol, dibasic sodium phosphate 7 H2O, zinc oxide and \nwater for injection. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may have been used to adjust the \nacidity.  \n\n \nWhat Humalog looks like and contents of the pack \nHumalog 100 units/ml, solution for injection is a sterile, clear, colourless, aqueous solution and \ncontains 100 units of insulin lispro in each millilitre (100 units/ml) solution for injection. Each vial \ncontains 1000 units (10 millilitres). Humalog 100 units/ml, solution for injection in vial comes in a \npack of 1 vial, 2 vials or a multipack of 5 x 1 vial. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \nHumalog 100 units/ml, solution for injection in vial is made by: \n\uf0b7 Lilly S.A., Avda. de la Industria 30, 28108 Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain. \n \nThe product licence is held by: Eli Lilly Nederland B.V., Papendorpseweg 83, 3528 BJ Utrecht, The \nNetherlands. \n \nFor any information about this medicinal product, please contact the local representative of the \nMarketing Authorisation Holder: \n \nBelgique/Belgi\u00eb/Belgien \nEli Lilly Benelux S.A./N.V. \nT\u00e9l/Tel: + 32-(0)2 548 84 84 \n \n\nLietuva \nEli Lilly Lietuva \nTel. +370 (5) 2649600 \n \n\n\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \n\u0422\u041f \"\u0415\u043b\u0438 \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\" \u0411.\u0412. - \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \n\u0442\u0435\u043b. + 359 2 491 41 40 \n \n\nLuxembourg/Luxemburg \nEli Lilly Benelux S.A./N.V. \nT\u00e9l/Tel: + 32-(0)2 548 84 84 \n\n\u010cesk\u00e1 republika \nELI LILLY \u010cR, s.r.o. \nTel: + 420 234 664 111 \n \n\nMagyarorsz\u00e1g \nLilly Hung\u00e1ria Kft. \nTel: + 36 1 328 5100 \n\nDanmark \nEli Lilly Danmark A/S  \nTlf: +45 45 26 6000 \n \n\nMalta \nCharles de Giorgio Ltd. \nTel: + 356 25600 500 \n\nDeutschland \nLilly Deutschland GmbH \nTel. + 49-(0) 6172 273 2222 \n \n\nNederland \nEli Lilly Nederland B.V.  \nTel: + 31-(0) 30 60 25 800 \n\n\n\n 108 \n\nEesti \nEli Lilly Nederland B.V. \nTel: +372 6817 280 \n \n\nNorge \nEli Lilly Norge A.S.  \nTlf: + 47 22 88 18 00 \n\n\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 \n\u03a6\u0391\u03a1\u039c\u0391\u03a3\u0395\u03a1\u0392-\u039b\u0399\u039b\u039b\u03a5 \u0391.\u0395.\u0392.\u0395.  \n\u03a4\u03b7\u03bb: +30 210 629 4600 \n \n\n\u00d6sterreich \nEli Lilly Ges. m.b.H.  \nTel: + 43-(0) 1 711 780 \n\nEspa\u00f1a \nLilly S.A. \nTel: + 34-91 663 50 00 \n \n\nPolska \nEli Lilly Polska Sp. z o.o. \nTel: +48 22 440 33 00 \n\nFrance \nLilly France S.A.S. \nT\u00e9l: +33-(0) 1 55 49 34 34 \n \n\nPortugal \nLilly Portugal - Produtos Farmac\u00eauticos, Lda \nTel: + 351-21-4126600 \n\nHrvatska \nEli Lilly Hrvatska d.o.o. \nTel: +385 1 2350 999 \n \n\nRom\u00e2nia \nEli Lilly Rom\u00e2nia S.R.L. \nTel: + 40 21 4023000 \n\nIreland \nEli Lilly and Company (Ireland) Limited \nTel: + 353-(0) 1 661 4377 \n \n\nSlovenija \nEli Lilly farmacevtska dru\u017eba, d.o.o. \nTel: +386 (0) 1 580 00 10 \n \n\n\u00cdsland \nIcepharma hf.  \nS\u00edmi + 354 540 8000 \n \n\nSlovensk\u00e1 republika \nEli Lilly Slovakia s.r.o. \nTel: + 421 220 663 111 \n \n\nItalia \nEli Lilly Italia S.p.A. \nTel: + 39- 055 42571 \n \n\nSuomi/Finland \nOy Eli Lilly Finland Ab  \nPuh/Tel: + 358-(0) 9 85 45 250 \n \n\n\u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \nPhadisco Ltd  \n\u03a4\u03b7\u03bb: +357 22 715000 \n \n\nSverige \nEli Lilly Sweden AB \nTel: + 46-(0) 8 7378800 \n\nLatvija \nEli Lilly (Suisse) S.A P\u0101rst\u0101vniec\u012bba Latvij\u0101  \nTel: +371 67364000 \n \n\nUnited Kingdom \nEli Lilly and Company Limited \nTel: + 44-(0) 1256 315000 \n\n \nThis leaflet was last revised in {MM/YYYY}. \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/. \n\n\n\n 109 \n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nHumalog 100 units/ml, solution for injection in cartridge \ninsulin lispro \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Humalog is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog \n3. How to use Humalog \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog is and what it is used for \n \nHumalog is used to treat diabetes. Humalog works more quickly than normal human insulin because \nthe insulin molecule has been changed slightly.  \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your \nblood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It \nworks very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally \nuse Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.  \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of insulin \ncomes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin unless \nyour doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. \n \nHumalog is suitable for use in adults and children.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog  \n \nDo NOT use Humalog \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to \n\ndeal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog than you need). \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the \n\nwarning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this \nleaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how \nmuch to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood \nglucose often. \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin \nhave reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have \nhypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\n\n 110 \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse \n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n-  Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. \n\nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals \nat different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform \nyour doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness \nof breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics,  \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 octreotide,  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201d (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers, or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol,  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 angiotensin II receptor blockers. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you \nhave: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Humalog \n \nThe 3 ml cartridge is only for use in Lilly 3 ml pens. It is not for use in 1.5 ml pens. \n \n\n\n\n 111 \n\nAlways check the pack and the cartridge label for the name and type of the insulin when you get \nit from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog that your doctor has told you to use. \n \nAlways use Humalog exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \nare not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by you only, \neven if the needle on the delivery device is changed. \n \nDosage \n\uf0b7 You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject \n\nsoon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, \nand how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes \nclinic regularly. \n\n\uf0b7 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\uf0b7 Inject Humalog under the skin. You should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told \nyou to. \n\n \nPreparing Humalog \n\uf0b7 Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if \n\nit looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time \nyou inject yourself. \n\n \nGetting the pen ready to use \n\uf0b7 First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge. \n\uf0b7 You must only use Humalog cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that \n\nHumalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The \n3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen. \n\n\uf0b7 Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen. \n\uf0b7 You will set the dose to 1 or 2 units. Then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the \n\nside of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top. With the pen still pointing up, press the \ninjection mechanism. Do this until a drop of Humalog comes out of the needle. There may still \nbe some small air bubbles left in the pen. These are harmless, but if the air bubble is too big, it \nmay make the dose of your injection less accurate. \n\n \nInjecting Humalog \n\uf0b7 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the \n\nskin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle \nin the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area \nyou have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection \nand that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn\u2019t matter which \ninjection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog injection will \nstill work quicker than soluble human insulin. \n\n\uf0b7 You must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route. Inject Humalog as your physician \nor nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route. \nHe will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your \nglucose levels are too high. \n\n \nAfter injecting \n\uf0b7 As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap. \n\nThis will keep the Humalog sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the \npen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the \ncap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. \n\n \n\n\n\n 112 \n\nFurther injections \n\uf0b7 Before every injection, dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing \n\nup until a drop of Humalog comes out of the needle. You can see how much Humalog is left by \nlooking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge. The distance between each mark on the gauge \nis about 20 units. If there is not enough for your dose, change the cartridge. \n\n \nDo not mix any other insulin in a Humalog cartridge. Once the cartridge is empty, do not use it \nagain.  \n \nUsing Humalog in an infusion pump \n\uf0b7 Only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro. Before \n\ninfusing insulin lispro, the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the \nsuitability or otherwise for the particular pump. Read and follow the instructions in the product \nliterature supplied with the infusion pump. \n\n\uf0b7 Be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump. \n\uf0b7 Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in \n\nthe product information supplied with the infusion set. \n\uf0b7 In the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped until the episode is \n\nresolved. If repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur, notify your doctor or clinic and \nconsider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion. \n\n\uf0b7 A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels. \nIf an interruption to insulin flow is suspected, follow the instructions in the product literature \nand if appropriate, notify your doctor or clinic. \n\n\uf0b7 When used with an insulin infusion pump, Humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin. \n \nIf you take more Humalog than you need \nIf you take more Humalog than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar \n \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even \ndeath (see A and B in section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d). \n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog, or a spare pen and cartridges, in case \n\nyou lose your pen or cartridges or they get damaged. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you stop using Humalog. \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin \nunless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n 113 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSystemic allergy is rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating \nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, tell your doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (\uf0b3 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the \narea of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this \nhappens to you, tell your doctor. \n \nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you notice \nyour skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nA.  Hypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness    \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness  \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache    \u2022 cold sweat. \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nB.  Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\n\n\n 114 \n\n\u2022 feeling sleepy \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face  \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst   \u2022 feeling or being sick. \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. \n \nC.  Illness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Humalog \n \nBefore the first use store your Humalog in a refrigerator (2\uf0b0C \u2013 8\uf0b0C). Do not freeze.  \n \nKeep your cartridge in use at room temperature (15\u00b0 - 30\u00b0C) and discard after 28 days. Do not put it \nnear heat or in the sun. Do not keep your pen or the cartridges you are using in the fridge. The pen \nwith the inserted cartridge should not be stored with the needle attached. \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice it is coloured or it has solid pieces in it. You must use it only if \nit looks like water. Check this each time you inject yourself. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \nWhat Humalog 100 units/ml solution for injection in cartridge contains \n- The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a \u2018recombinant \n\nDNA technology\u2019 process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other \nhuman and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural \nhormone made by the pancreas. \n\n- The other ingredients are m-cresol, glycerol, dibasic sodium phosphate 7 H2O, zinc oxide and \nwater for injection. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may have been used to adjust the \nacidity.  \n\n \nWhat Humalog looks like and contents of the pack \nHumalog 100 units/ml, solution for injection is a sterile, clear, colourless, aqueous solution and \ncontains 100 units of insulin lispro in each millilitre (100 units/ml) solution for injection. Each \ncartridge contains 300 units (3 millilitres). The cartridges come in packs of 5 or10 cartridges. Not all \npack sizes may be marketed. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \nHumalog 100 units/ml, solution for injection in cartridge is made by: \n\uf0b7 Lilly France S.A.S., Rue du Colonel Lilly, 67640 Fegersheim, France, \n\uf0b7 Eli Lilly Italia S.p.A., Via Gramsci 731-733, 50019 Sesto Fiorentino, (FI) Italy. \n \nThe product licence is held by: Eli Lilly Nederland B.V., Papendorpseweg 83, 3528 BJ Utrecht, The \nNetherlands. \n \n\n\n\n 115 \n\nFor any information about this medicinal product, please contact the local representative of the \nMarketing Authorisation Holder: \n \nBelgique/Belgi\u00eb/Belgien \nEli Lilly Benelux S.A./N.V. \nT\u00e9l/Tel: + 32-(0)2 548 84 84 \n \n\nLietuva \nEli Lilly Lietuva \nTel. +370 (5) 2649600 \n \n\n\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \n\u0422\u041f \"\u0415\u043b\u0438 \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\" \u0411.\u0412. - \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \n\u0442\u0435\u043b. + 359 2 491 41 40 \n \n\nLuxembourg/Luxemburg \nEli Lilly Benelux S.A./N.V. \nT\u00e9l/Tel: + 32-(0)2 548 84 84 \n\n\u010cesk\u00e1 republika \nELI LILLY \u010cR, s.r.o. \nTel: + 420 234 664 111 \n \n\nMagyarorsz\u00e1g \nLilly Hung\u00e1ria Kft. \nTel: + 36 1 328 5100 \n\nDanmark \nEli Lilly Danmark A/S  \nTlf: +45 45 26 6000 \n \n\nMalta \nCharles de Giorgio Ltd. \nTel: + 356 25600 500 \n\nDeutschland \nLilly Deutschland GmbH \nTel. + 49-(0) 6172 273 2222 \n \n\nNederland \nEli Lilly Nederland B.V.  \nTel: + 31-(0) 30 60 25 800 \n\nEesti \nEli Lilly Nederland B.V. \nTel: +372 6817 280 \n \n\nNorge \nEli Lilly Norge A.S.  \nTlf: + 47 22 88 18 00 \n\n\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 \n\u03a6\u0391\u03a1\u039c\u0391\u03a3\u0395\u03a1\u0392-\u039b\u0399\u039b\u039b\u03a5 \u0391.\u0395.\u0392.\u0395.  \n\u03a4\u03b7\u03bb: +30 210 629 4600 \n \n\n\u00d6sterreich \nEli Lilly Ges. m.b.H.  \nTel: + 43-(0) 1 711 780 \n\nEspa\u00f1a \nLilly S.A. \nTel: + 34-91 663 50 00 \n \n\nPolska \nEli Lilly Polska Sp. z o.o. \nTel: +48 22 440 33 00 \n\nFrance \nLilly France S.A.S. \nT\u00e9l: +33-(0) 1 55 49 34 34 \n \n\nPortugal \nLilly Portugal - Produtos Farmac\u00eauticos, Lda \nTel: + 351-21-4126600 \n\nHrvatska \nEli Lilly Hrvatska d.o.o. \nTel: +385 1 2350 999 \n \n\nRom\u00e2nia \nEli Lilly Rom\u00e2nia S.R.L. \nTel: + 40 21 4023000 \n\nIreland \nEli Lilly and Company (Ireland) Limited \nTel: + 353-(0) 1 661 4377 \n \n\nSlovenija \nEli Lilly farmacevtska dru\u017eba, d.o.o. \nTel: +386 (0) 1 580 00 10 \n \n\n\u00cdsland \nIcepharma hf.  \nS\u00edmi + 354 540 8000 \n \n\nSlovensk\u00e1 republika \nEli Lilly Slovakia s.r.o. \nTel: + 421 220 663 111 \n \n\nItalia \nEli Lilly Italia S.p.A. \nTel: + 39- 055 42571 \n \n\nSuomi/Finland \nOy Eli Lilly Finland Ab  \nPuh/Tel: + 358-(0) 9 85 45 250 \n \n\n\n\n 116 \n\n\u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \nPhadisco Ltd  \n\u03a4\u03b7\u03bb: +357 22 715000 \n \n\nSverige \nEli Lilly Sweden AB \nTel: + 46-(0) 8 7378800 \n\nLatvija \nEli Lilly (Suisse) S.A P\u0101rst\u0101vniec\u012bba Latvij\u0101  \nTel: +371 67364000 \n \n\nUnited Kingdom \nEli Lilly and Company Limited \nTel: + 44-(0) 1256 315000 \n\n \nThis leaflet was last revised in {MM/YYYY}. \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/. \n\n\n\n 117 \n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n \n\nHumalog Mix25 100 units/ml, suspension for injection in vial \ninsulin lispro \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Humalog Mix25 is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog Mix25 \n3. How to use Humalog Mix25 \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog Mix25 \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog Mix25 is and what it is used for \n \nHumalog Mix25 is used to treat diabetes.  Humalog Mix25 is a premixed suspension. Its active \nsubstance is insulin lispro.  25% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 is dissolved in water and it \nworks more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed \nslightly.  75% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 is available in a suspension together with \nprotamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in \nyour blood. Humalog Mix25 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the \nlong term. Humalog Mix25 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should \nnormally use Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix25 as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of \ninsulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your \ninsulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog  Mix25 \n \nDo NOT use Humalog Mix25 \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to \n\ndeal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix25than you need). \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the \n\nwarning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this \nleaflet.  You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how \nmuch to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood \nglucose often. \n\n\n\n 118 \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin \nhave reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have \nhypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes \nnurse \n\n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n-  Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.  \n\nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals \nat different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke \nwho were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. \nInform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual \nshortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog Mix25 \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics,  \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 octreotide,  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201d (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers, or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol,  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 angiotensin II receptor blockers. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you \nhave: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog Mix25 \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n\n\n\n 119 \n\n3. How to use Humalog Mix25 \n \nAlways check the pack and the vial label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it \nfrom your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix25 that your doctor has told you to \nuse. \n \nAlways use Humalog Mix25 exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor \nif you are not sure. \nDosage \n\u2022 You should normally inject Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you \n\ncan inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, \nwhen to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and \nvisit your diabetes clinic regularly. \n\n\u2022 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\u2022 Inject Humalog Mix25 under the skin. You should not administer it using a different \nadministration route. Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously. \n\n \nPreparing Humalog Mix25 \n\u2022 Vials containing Humalog Mix25 should be rotated in the palms of the hands before use to \n\nresuspend insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky. Do not shake vigorously as this \nmay cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose. The vials \nshould be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if \nsolid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the vial, giving it a frosted appearance. \nCheck each time you inject yourself. \n\n \nInjecting Humalog Mix25 \n\u2022 First wash your hands. \n\u2022 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Clean the rubber \n\nstopper on the vial, but do not remove the stopper. \n\u2022 Use a clean, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of \n\nHumalog Mix25 you want.  Your doctor or clinic will tell you how to do this.  Do not share \nyour needles and syringes. \n\n\u2022 Inject under the skin, as you were taught.  Do not inject directly into a vein. After your \ninjection, leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole \ndose.  Do not rub the area you have just injected.  Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 \ncm) from the last injection and that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you inject, as you have been taught. \n\n \nIf you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need \nIf you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog Mix25 \nIf you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar \n \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even \ndeath (see A and B in section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d).  \n\n\n\n 120 \n\n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog Mix25. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you stop using Humalog Mix25. \nIf you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your \ninsulin unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSystemic allergy is rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating \n \nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix25, tell your doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (\uf0b3 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the \narea of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this \nhappens to you, tell your doctor. \n \nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you notice \nyour skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nA.  Hypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog Mix25 or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. \n \n\n\n\n 121 \n\nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness   \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache   \u2022 cold sweat \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nB.  Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face  \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst   \u2022 feeling or being sick \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. \n \nC.  Illness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Humalog  Mix25 \n \nBefore the first use store your Humalog Mix25 in a refrigerator (2\uf0b0C \u2013 8\uf0b0C). Do not freeze. Keep your \nvial in use in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C) or at room temperature up to 30\u00b0C and discard after 28 days. \nDo not put it near heat or in the sun.  \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to \nthe bottom or wall of the vial, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \nWhat Humalog Mix25 100 units/ml suspension for injection in vial contains \n- The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a \u2018recombinant \n\nDNA technology\u2019 process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other \nhuman and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural \nhormone made by the pancreas. \n\n\n\n 122 \n\n- The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium \nphosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection.  Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid \nmay have been used to adjust the acidity. \n\n \nWhat Humalog Mix25 100 units/ml suspension for injection in vial looks like and contents of the \npack \nHumalog Mix25 100 units/ml suspension for injection is a white, sterile suspension and contains \n100 units of insulin lispro in each millilitre (100 units/ml) suspension for injection. 25% of the \ninsulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 is dissolved in water.  75% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 \nis available in a suspension together with protamine sulphate. Each vial contains 1000 units (10 \nmillilitres).

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Humalog Mix25 is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog Mix25 \n3. How to use Humalog Mix25 \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog Mix25 \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog Mix25 is and what it is used for \n \nHumalog Mix25 is used to treat diabetes.  Humalog Mix25 is a premixed suspension. Its active \nsubstance is insulin lispro.  25% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 is dissolved in water and it \nworks more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed \nslightly.  75% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 is available in a suspension together with \nprotamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in \nyour blood. Humalog Mix25 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the \nlong term. Humalog Mix25 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should \nnormally use Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix25 as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of \ninsulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your \ninsulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog  Mix25 \n \nDo NOT use Humalog Mix25 \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to \n\ndeal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need). \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the \n\nwarning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this \nleaflet.  You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how \nmuch to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood \nglucose often. \n\n\n\n 125 \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin \nhave reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have \nhypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes \nnurse \n\n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n-  Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.  \n\nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals \nat different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke \nwho were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. \nInform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual \nshortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog Mix25 \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics,  \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 octreotide,  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201d (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers, or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol,  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 angiotensin II receptor blockers. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you \nhave: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog Mix25 \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n\n\n\n 126 \n\n3. How to use Humalog Mix25 \n \nThe 3 ml cartridge is only for use in Lilly 3 ml pens. It is not for use in 1.5 ml pens. \n \nAlways check the pack and the cartridge label for the name and type of the insulin when you \nget it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix25 that your doctor has told \nyou to use. \n \nAlways use Humalog Mix25 exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor \nif you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by \nyou only, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed. \n \nDosage \n\u2022 You should normally inject Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you \n\ncan inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, \nwhen to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and \nvisit your diabetes clinic regularly. \n\n\u2022 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\u2022 Inject Humalog Mix25 under the skin. You should not administer it using a different \nadministration route. Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously. \n\n \nPreparing Humalog Mix25 \n\u2022 Cartridges containing Humalog Mix25 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times \n\nand inverted 180\u00b0 ten times immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears \nuniformly cloudy or milky. If not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed. \nCartridges contain a small glass bead to assist mixing. Do not shake vigorously as this may \ncause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges \nshould be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if \nsolid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. \nCheck each time you inject yourself. \n\n \nGetting the pen ready to use \n\uf0b7 First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge. \n\uf0b7 You must only use Humalog Mix25 cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that \n\nHumalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The \n3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen. \n\n\uf0b7 Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen. \n\uf0b7 You will set the dose to 1 or 2 units. Then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the \n\nside of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top. With the pen still pointing up, press the \ninjection mechanism. Do this until a drop of Humalog Mix25 comes out of the needle. There \nmay still be some small air bubbles left in the pen. These are harmless, but if the air bubble is \ntoo big, it may make the dose of your injection less accurate. \n\n \nInjecting Humalog Mix25 \n\uf0b7 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the \n\nskin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle \nin the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area \nyou have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection \nand that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you inject, as you have been taught. \n\n \nAfter injecting \n\uf0b7 As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap. \n\nThis will keep the Humalog Mix25 sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back \ninto the pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. \nReplace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. \n\n\n\n 127 \n\n \nFurther injections \n\uf0b7 Before every injection, dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing \n\nup until a drop of Humalog Mix25 comes out of the needle. You can see how much Humalog is \nleft by looking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge. The distance between each mark on the \ngauge is about 20 units. If there is not enough for your dose, change the cartridge.  \n\n \nDo not mix any other insulin in a Humalog Mix25 cartridge. Once the cartridge is empty, do not \nuse it again. \n \nIf you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need \nIf you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog Mix25 \nIf you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar \n \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even \ndeath (see A and B in section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d).  \n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog Mix25, or a spare pen and cartridges, \nin case you lose your pen or cartridges or they get damaged. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you stop using Humalog Mix25. \nIf you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your \ninsulin unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSystemic allergy is rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating \nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix25, tell your doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (\uf0b3 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the \narea of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this \nhappens to you, tell your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n 128 \n\nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you notice \nyour skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nA.  Hypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog Mix25 or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness    \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness  \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache    \u2022 cold sweat \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nB.  Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face  \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst   \u2022 feeling or being sick \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. \n \nC.  Illness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n\n\n\n 129 \n\n5. How to store Humalog  Mix25 \n \nBefore the first use store your Humalog Mix25 in a refrigerator (2\uf0b0C \u2013 8\uf0b0C). Do not freeze.  \n \nKeep your cartridge in use at room temperature (15\u00b0 - 30\u00b0C) and discard after 28 days. Do not put it \nnear heat or in the sun. Do not keep your pen or the cartridges you are using in the fridge. The pen \nwith the inserted cartridge should not be stored with the needle attached. \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to \nthe bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \nWhat Humalog Mix25 100 units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge contains \n- The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a \u2018recombinant \n\nDNA technology\u2019 process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other \nhuman and animal insulins.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Humalog Mix50 is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog Mix50 \n3. How to use Humalog Mix50 \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog Mix50 \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog Mix50 is and what it is used for \n \nHumalog Mix50 is used to treat diabetes.  Humalog Mix50 is a premixed suspension. Its active \nsubstance is insulin lispro.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 is dissolved in water and it \nworks more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed \nslightly.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 is available in a suspension together with \nprotamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in \nyour blood. Humalog Mix50 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the \nlong term. Humalog Mix50 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should \nnormally use Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix50 as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of \ninsulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your \ninsulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog Mix50 \n \nDo NOT use Humalog Mix50 \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to \n\ndeal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix50 than you need). \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the \n\nwarning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this \nleaflet.  You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how \nmuch to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood \nglucose often. \n\n\n\n 132 \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin \nhave reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have \nhypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes \nnurse \n\n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n-  Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.  \n\nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals \nat different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke \nwho were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. \nInform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual \nshortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog Mix50 \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics,  \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 octreotide,  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201d (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers, or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol,  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 angiotensin II receptor blockers. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you \nhave: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog Mix50 \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n\n\n\n 133 \n\n3. How to use Humalog Mix50 \n \nThe 3 ml cartridge is only for use in Lilly 3 ml pens. It is not for use in 1.5 ml pens. \n \nAlways check the pack and the cartridge label for the name and type of the insulin when you \nget it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix50 that your doctor has told \nyou to use. \n \nAlways use Humalog Mix50 exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor \nif you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by \nyou only, even if the needle on the delivery device is changed. \n \nDosage \n\u2022 You should normally inject Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you \n\ncan inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, \nwhen to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and \nvisit your diabetes clinic regularly. \n\n\u2022 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\u2022 Inject Humalog Mix50 under the skin. You should not administer it using a different \nadministration route. Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously. \n\n \nPreparing Humalog Mix50 \n\u2022 Cartridges containing Humalog Mix50 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times \n\nand inverted 180\u00b0 ten times immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears \nuniformly cloudy or milky. If not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed. \nCartridges contain a small glass bead to assist mixing. Do not shake vigorously as this may \ncause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges \nshould be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if \nsolid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. \nCheck each time you inject yourself. \n\n \nGetting the pen ready to use \n\uf0b7 First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge. \n\uf0b7 You must only use Humalog Mix50 cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that \n\nHumalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The \n3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen. \n\n\uf0b7 Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen. \n\uf0b7 You will set the dose to 1 or 2 units. Then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the \n\nside of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top. With the pen still pointing up, press the \ninjection mechanism. Do this until a drop of Humalog Mix50 comes out of the needle. There \nmay still be some small air bubbles left in the pen. These are harmless, but if the air bubble is \ntoo big, it may make the dose of your injection less accurate. \n\n \nInjecting Humalog Mix50 \n\uf0b7 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the \n\nskin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle \nin the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area \nyou have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection \nand that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you inject, as you have been taught. \n\n \nAfter injecting \n\uf0b7 As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap. \n\nThis will keep the Humalog Mix50 sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back \ninto the pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. \nReplace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. \n\n\n\n 134 \n\n \nFurther injections \n\uf0b7 Before every injection, dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing \n\nup until a drop of Humalog Mix50 comes out of the needle. You can see how much Humalog is \nleft by looking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge. The distance between each mark on the \ngauge is about 20 units. If there is not enough for your dose, change the cartridge.  \n\n \nDo not mix any other insulin in a Humalog Mix50 cartridge. Once the cartridge is empty, do not \nuse it again. \n \nIf you take more Humalog Mix50 than you need \nIf you take more Humalog Mix50 than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog Mix50 \nIf you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar \n \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even \ndeath (see A and B in section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d).  \n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always keep a spare pen and cartridges, in case you lose your pen or cartridges or they get \ndamaged. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you stop using Humalog Mix50. \nIf you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your \ninsulin unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSystemic allergy is rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating \nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix50, tell your doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (\uf0b3 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the \narea of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this \nhappens to you, tell your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n 135 \n\nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you notice \nyour skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nA.  Hypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog Mix50 or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness    \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness  \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache    \u2022 cold sweat \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nB.  Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face  \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst   \u2022 feeling or being sick \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. \n \nC.  Illness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n\n\n\n 136 \n\n5. How to store Humalog Mix50 \n \nBefore the first use store your Humalog Mix50 in a refrigerator (2\uf0b0C \u2013 8\uf0b0C). Do not freeze.  \n \nKeep your cartridge in use at room temperature (15\u00b0 - 30\u00b0C) and discard after 28 days. Do not put it \nnear heat or in the sun. Do not keep your pen or the cartridges you are using in the fridge. The pen \nwith the inserted cartridge should not be stored with the needle attached. \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to \nthe bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \nWhat Humalog Mix50 100 units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge contains \n- The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a \u2018recombinant \n\nDNA technology\u2019 process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other \nhuman and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural \nhormone made by the pancreas. \n\n- The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium \nphosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Humalog KwikPen is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog KwikPen \n3. How to use Humalog KwikPen \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog KwikPen \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog KwikPen is and what it is used for \n \nHumalog KwikPen is used to treat diabetes. It works more quickly than normal human insulin because \nthe insulin molecule has been changed slightly. \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your \nblood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It \nworks very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally \nuse Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.  \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog KwikPen as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of \ninsulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin \nunless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. \n \nHumalog is suitable for use in adults and children.  \n \nThe KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  \nOne KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials 1 unit at a time.  The number of \nunits are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. You can give \nfrom 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give \nyourself more than one injection.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog KwikPen \n \nDo NOT use Humalog KwikPen  \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to \n\ndeal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog than you need). \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \n \n\n\n\n 139 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the \n\nwarning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this \nleaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how \nmuch to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood \nglucose often. \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin \nhave reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have \nhypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse \n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n-  Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. \n\nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals \nat different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform \nyour doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness \nof breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n\uf0b7 This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone \ntrained to use the Pen. \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog KwikPen \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics,  \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 octreotide,  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201d (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers, or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol,  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 angiotensin II receptor blockers. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription  (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you \nhave: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n\n\n\n 140 \n\n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog KwikPen \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Humalog KwikPen \n \nAlways check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin \nwhen you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog KwikPen that your \ndoctor has told you to use. \n \nAlways use Humalog KwikPen exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your \ndoctor if you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by \nyou only, even if the needle is changed. \n \nDosage \n\uf0b7 You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject \n\nsoon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, \nand how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes \nclinic regularly. \n\n\uf0b7 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\uf0b7 Humalog KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you \nneed to inject your insulin by another method.   \n\n \nPreparing Humalog KwikPen  \n\uf0b7 Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if \n\nit looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time \nyou inject yourself. \n\n \nGetting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) \n\uf0b7 First wash your hands. \n\uf0b7 Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions \n\ncarefully. Here are some reminders. \n\uf0b7 Use a clean needle. (Needles are not included). \n\uf0b7 Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air \n\nbubbles from your KwikPen. There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these \nare harmless. But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. \n\n \nInjecting Humalog  \n\uf0b7 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the \n\nskin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle \nin the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area \nyou have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection \nand that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn\u2019t matter which \ninjection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog injection will \nstill work quicker than soluble human insulin. \n\n\uf0b7 You must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route. Inject Humalog as your physician \nor nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route. \nHe will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your \nglucose levels are too high. \n\n \n\n\n\n 141 \n\nAfter injecting \n\uf0b7 As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer \n\nneedle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering the pen \nand your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the cap \non your pen. \n\n \nFurther injections \n\uf0b7 Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear any air \n\nbubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle pointing \nup. The scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not mix any other insulin in your disposable pen. Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it \nagain. Please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do \nthis. \n\n \nUsing Humalog in an infusion pump \n\uf0b7 KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin.  Do not use the pen to administer \n\nHumalog by a different way.  Other forms of Humalog 100 unit /ml are available if this is \nnecessary.  Speak to your doctor if this applies to you. \n\n \nIf you take more Humalog than you need \nIf you take more Humalog than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar \n \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even \ndeath (see A and B in section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d).  \n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog, or a spare pen and cartridges, in case \nyou lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you stop using Humalog. \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin \nunless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSystemic allergy is rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating \n\n\n\n 142 \n\n \nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, tell your doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (\uf0b3 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the \narea of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this \nhappens to you, tell your doctor. \n \nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you notice \nyour skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nA.  Hypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness    \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness  \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache    \u2022 cold sweat \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nB.  Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy  \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face   \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst    \u2022 feeling or being sick \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. \n \n\n\n\n 143 \n\nC.  Illness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Humalog KwikPen \n \nBefore the first use store your Humalog KwikPen in a refrigerator (2\uf0b0C \u2013 8\uf0b0C). Do not freeze.  \n \nKeep your Humalog KwikPen in use at room temperature (15\u00b0 - 30\u00b0C) and discard after 28 days. Do \nnot put it near heat or in the sun. Do not keep the KwikPen that you are using in the fridge. The \nKwikPen should not be stored with the needle attached. \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice the solution is coloured or it has solid pieces in it. You must use \nit only if it looks like water. Check this each time you inject yourself. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \nWhat Humalog 100 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection contains \n- The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a \u2018recombinant \n\nDNA technology\u2019 process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other \nhuman and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural \nhormone made by the pancreas. \n\n- The other ingredients are m-cresol, glycerol, dibasic sodium phosphate 7 H2O, zinc oxide and \nwater for injection. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may have been used to adjust the \nacidity.  \n\n \nWhat Humalog KwikPen looks like and contents of the pack \nHumalog 100 units/ml KwikPen, solution for injection is a sterile, clear, colourless, aqueous solution \nand contains 100 units of insulin lispro in each millilitre (100 units/ml) solution for injection.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen  \n3. How to use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog Mix25 KwikPen \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is and what it is used for \n \nHumalog Mix25 KwikPen is used to treat diabetes.  It is a premixed suspension. Its active substance is \ninsulin lispro.  25% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is dissolved in water and it \nworks more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed \nslightly.  75% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is available in a suspension together \nwith protamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in \nyour blood. Humalog Mix25 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the \nlong term. Humalog Mix25 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should \nnormally use Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each \nkind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change \nyour insulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. \n \nThe KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  \nOne KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials 1 unit at a time. The number of \nunits are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. You can give \nfrom 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give \nyourself more than one injection.  \n \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog  Mix25 KwikPen \n \nDo NOT use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to \n\ndeal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need). \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n\n\n 147 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the \n\nwarning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this \nleaflet.  You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how \nmuch to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood \nglucose often. \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin \nhave reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have \nhypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes \nnurse \n\n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n-  Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.  \n\nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals \nat different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke \nwho were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. \nInform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual \nshortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n\uf0b7 This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of \nsomeone trained to use the Pen. \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog Mix25 KwikPen \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics,  \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 octreotide,  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201d (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers, or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol,  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 angiotensin II receptor blockers. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \n\n\n\n 148 \n\nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you \nhave: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog Mix25 KwikPen \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen \n \nAlways check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin \nwhen you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix25 KwikPen that \nyour doctor has told you to use. \n \nAlways use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with \nyour doctor if you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used \nby you only, even if the needle is changed. \n \nDosage \n\u2022 You should normally inject Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you \n\ncan inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, \nwhen to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and \nvisit your diabetes clinic regularly. \n\n\u2022 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\u2022 Humalog Mix25 KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your \ndoctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method.  \n\n \nPreparing Humalog Mix25 KwikPen \n\u2022 The KwikPen should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180\u00b0 ten times \n\nimmediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky. If not, \nrepeat the above procedure until contents are mixed.  Cartridges contain a small glass bead to \nassist mixing.  Do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with \nthe correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges should be examined frequently and should \nnot be used if clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or \nwall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. \n\n \nGetting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) \n\uf0b7 First wash your hands. \n\uf0b7 Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen.  Please follow the instructions \n\ncarefully. Here are some reminders. \n\uf0b7 Use a clean needle.  (Needles are not included). \n\uf0b7 Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air \n\nbubbles from your KwikPen.  There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these \nare harmless.  But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. \n\n \nInjecting Humalog Mix25 \n\uf0b7 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed.  Inject under the \n\nskin, as you were taught.  Do not inject directly into a vein.  After your injection, leave the \nneedle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose.  Do not rub the \n\n\n\n 149 \n\narea you have just injected.  Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from where you \nlast injected and that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you inject, as you have been taught. \n\n \nAfter injecting \n\uf0b7 As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer \n\nneedle cap.  This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking.  It also stops air entering the \npen and your needle clogging.  Do not share your needles.  Do not share your pen.  Replace \nthe cap on the pen. \n\n \nFurther injections \n\uf0b7 Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle.  Before every injection, clear any air \n\nbubbles.  You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle \npointing up.  The scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not mix any other insulin in your disposable pen.  Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it \nagain.  Please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do \nthis. \n\n \nIf you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need \nIf you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog Mix25 \nIf you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar \n \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even \ndeath (see A and B in section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d).  \n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Humalog Mix25, or a spare pen and cartridges, \nin case you lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you stop using Humalog Mix25. \nIf you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your \ninsulin unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSystemic allergy is rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating \n\n\n\n 150 \n\nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix25, tell your doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (\uf0b3 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the \narea of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this \nhappens to you, tell your doctor. \n \nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you notice \nyour skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nA.  Hypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog Mix25 or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness    \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness  \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache    \u2022 cold sweat \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nB.  Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face  \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst   \u2022 feeling or being sick \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. \n \n\n\n\n 151 \n\nC.  Illness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Humalog Mix25 KwikPen \n \nBefore the first use store your Humalog Mix25 KwikPen in a refrigerator (2\uf0b0C \u2013 8\uf0b0C). Do not freeze.  \n \nKeep your Humalog Mix25 KwikPen in use at room temperature (15\u00b0 - 30\u00b0C) and discard after 28 \ndays. Do not put it near heat or in the sun. Do not keep the KwikPen that you are using in the fridge. \nThe KwikPen should not be stored with the needle attached. \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to \nthe bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \nWhat Humalog Mix25 100 units/ml KwikPen, suspension for injection contains \n- The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a \u2018recombinant \n\nDNA technology\u2019 process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other \nhuman and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural \nhormone made by the pancreas. \n\n- The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium \nphosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection.  Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid \nmay have been used to adjust the acidity. \n\n \nWhat Humalog Mix25 100 units/ml KwikPen, suspension for injection looks like and contents of \nthe pack \nHumalog Mix25 100 units/ KwikPen, suspension for injection is a white, sterile suspension and \ncontains 100 units of insulin lispro in each millilitre (100 units/ml) suspension for injection.  25% of \nthe insulin lispro in Humalog Mix25 is dissolved in water.  75% of the insulin lispro in Humalog \nMix25 is available in a suspension together with protamine sulphate. Each Humalog Mix25 KwikPen \ncontains 300 units (3 millilitres). The Humalog Mix25 KwikPen comes in a pack of 5 pre-filled pens \nor a multipack of 2 x 5 pre-filled pens.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen  \n3. How to use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog Mix50 KwikPen \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is and what it is used for \n \nHumalog Mix50 KwikPen is used to treat diabetes.  It is a premixed suspension. Its active substance is \ninsulin lispro.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is dissolved in water and it \nworks more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed \nslightly.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is available in a suspension together \nwith protamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in \nyour blood. Humalog Mix50 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the \nlong term. Humalog Mix50 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should \nnormally use Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each \nkind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change \nyour insulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin. \n \nThe KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  \nOne KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials 1 unit at a time.  The number of \nunits are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. You can give \nfrom 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give \nyourself more than one injection.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog  Mix50 KwikPen \n \nDo NOT use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to \n\ndeal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix50 than you need). \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \n\n\n\n 155 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the \n\nwarning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this \nleaflet.  You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how \nmuch to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood \nglucose often. \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin \nhave reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have \nhypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes \nnurse \n\n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n-  Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.  \n\nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals \nat different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke \nwho were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. \nInform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual \nshortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n\uf0b7 This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of \nsomeone trained to use the Pen. \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog Mix50 KwikPen \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics,  \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 octreotide,  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201d (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),  \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers, or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol,  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 angiotensin II receptor blockers. \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you \nhave: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\n\n\n 156 \n\n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog Mix50 KwikPen \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen \n \nAlways check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin \nwhen you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix50 KwikPen that \nyour doctor has told you to use. \n \nAlways use Humalog Mix50 KwikPen exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with \nyour doctor if you are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used \nby you only, even if the needle is changed. \n \nDosage \n\u2022 You should normally inject Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal.  If you need to, you \n\ncan inject soon after a meal.  But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, \nwhen to use it, and how often.  These instructions are only for you.  Follow them exactly and \nvisit your diabetes clinic regularly. \n\n\u2022 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before.  This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\u2022 Humalog Mix50 KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your \ndoctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method.    \n\n \nPreparing Humalog Mix50 KwikPen \n\u2022 The KwikPen should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180\u00b0 ten times \n\nimmediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky. If not, \nrepeat the above procedure until contents are mixed.  Cartridges contain a small glass bead to \nassist mixing.  Do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with \nthe correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges should be examined frequently and should \nnot be used if clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or \nwall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. \n\n \nGetting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) \n\uf0b7 First wash your hands. \n\uf0b7 Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen.  Please follow the instructions \n\ncarefully. Here are some reminders. \n\uf0b7 Use a clean needle.  (Needles are not included). \n\uf0b7 Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air \n\nbubbles from your KwikPen.  There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these \nare harmless.  But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. \n\n \nInjecting Humalog Mix50 \n\uf0b7 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed.  Inject under the \n\nskin, as you were taught.  Do not inject directly into a vein.  After your injection, leave the \nneedle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose.  Do not rub the \narea you have just injected.  Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from where you \nlast injected and that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you inject, as you have been taught. \n\n \nAfter injecting \n\uf0b7 As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer \n\nneedle cap.  This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking.  It also stops air entering the \n\n\n\n 157 \n\npen and your needle clogging.  Do not share your needles.  Do not share your pen.  Replace \nthe cap on the pen. \n\n \nFurther injections \n\uf0b7 Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle.  Before every injection, clear any air \n\nbubbles.  You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle \npointing up.  The scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not mix any other insulin in your disposable pen.  Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it \nagain.  Please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do \nthis. \n\n \nIf you take more Humalog Mix50 than you need \nIf you take more Humalog Mix50 than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog Mix50 \nIf you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood \nsugar \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even \ndeath (see A and B in section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d).  \n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always keep a spare pen and cartridges, in case you lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you stop using Humalog Mix50. \nIf you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your \ninsulin unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSystemic allergy is rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating \nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog Mix50, tell your doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (\uf0b3 1/100 to <1/10).  Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the \narea of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this \nhappens to you, tell your doctor. \n \nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to <1/100). If you notice \nyour skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n\n\n\n 158 \n\n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nA.  Hypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog Mix50 or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness    \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness  \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache    \u2022 cold sweat \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nB.  Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face  \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst   \u2022 feeling or being sick \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. \n \nC.  Illness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Humalog Mix50 KwikPen \n \nBefore the first use store your Humalog Mix50 KwikPen in a refrigerator (2\uf0b0C \u2013 8\uf0b0C). Do not freeze.  \n \n\n\n\n 159 \n\nKeep your Humalog Mix50 KwikPen in use at room temperature (15\u00b0 - 30\u00b0C) and discard after 28 \ndays. Do not put it near heat or in the sun. Do not keep the KwikPen that you are using in the fridge. \nThe KwikPen should not be stored with the needle attached. \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to \nthe bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \nWhat Humalog Mix50 100 units/ml KwikPen, suspension for injection contains \n- The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a \u2018recombinant \n\nDNA technology\u2019 process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other \nhuman and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural \nhormone made by the pancreas. \n\n- The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium \nphosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection.  Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid \nmay have been used to adjust the acidity. \n\n \nWhat Humalog Mix50 100 units/ml KwikPen, suspension for injection looks like and contents of \nthe pack \nHumalog Mix50 100 units/ml KwikPen, suspension for injection is a white, sterile suspension and \ncontains 100 units of insulin lispro in each millilitre (100 units/ml) suspension for injection.  50% of \nthe insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 is dissolved in water.  50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog \nMix50 is available in a suspension together with protamine sulphate. Each Humalog Mix50 KwikPen \ncontains 300 units (3 millilitres). The Humalog Mix50 KwikPen comes in a pack of 5 pre-filled pens \nor a multipack of 2 x 5 pre-filled pens.

This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare \nprofessional about your medical condition or your treatment. \n \nKwikPen (\u201cPen\u201d) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin. \nYou can give yourself multiple doses using one Pen. The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. You can give from \n1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself \nmore than one injection. The plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice \nthat it moves. The plunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 300 units in \nthe Pen. \n \nDo not share your pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do not reuse or \nshare needles with other people. You may give an infection to them or get an infection from \nthem. \n\nThis Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone \ntrained to use the Pen.   \n \n\nKwikPen Parts \n \n\nCap Clip \n                Cartridge \n\nHolder Label    Dose Indicator \n \n \n\nDose Knob \n\n    Pen     \nCap \n\nRubber \nSeal \n\nPlunger  Pen \nBody \n\nDose  \nWindow \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 163 \n\n \nPen Needle Parts \n\n(Needles Not Included) \n  Paper Tab  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nOuter Needle \nShield \n\nInner Needle \nShield \n\nNeedle  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHow to recognize your KwikPen: \n \n  \n\nHumalog \n    Humalog Humalog \n\n Mix25   Mix50  \n Solution Suspension \n\n(cloudy insulin) \nSuspension \n\n(cloudy insulin) \nPen colour: Blue Blue Blue \n\n \nDose Knob:  \n\nBurgundy \n \n\nYellow \n \n\nRed \n\nLabels: White with \nBurgundy \nColour Bar \n\nWhite with \nYellow \n\nColour Bar \n\nWhite with \nRed \n\nColour Bar \n \nSupplies needed to give your injection: \n \n\u2022 KwikPen containing your insulin \n\u2022 KwikPen compatible Needle (BD [Becton, Dickinson and Company] Pen Needles recommended) \n\u2022 Swab  \nNeedles and swab are not included. \n \nPreparing your Pen  \n\u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \n\u2022 Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important \n\nif you use more than 1 type of insulin. \n\u2022 Do not use your Pen past the expiration date printed on the Label. After you start using the Pen, \n\nthrow your Pen away after the in-use time specified in the Package Leaflet. \n\u2022 Always use a new Needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked Needles. \n\n\n\n 164 \n\n \n \n\nStep 1: \n \n\u2022 Pull the Pen Cap straight off. \n\n\u2013 Do not remove the Pen Label. \n\u2022 Wipe the Rubber Seal with a swab. \n \n \n\n \nStep 2: \n \n(For HUMALOG suspensions cloudy insulins only) \n \n\u2022 Gently roll the Pen 10 times.  \nAND \n\u2022 Invert the Pen 10 times. \n \n \n \nMixing is important to make sure you get the right dose. \nThe insulin should look evenly mixed. \n \n \n \nStep 3: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Check the appearance of the insulin. \n\u2013 HUMALOG solution should look clear and colourless. Do not use if it is cloudy, coloured, \n\nor has particles or clumps in it. \n \n\n\u2013 HUMALOG suspensions - cloudy insulins - should look white after mixing.  Do not use \nif it looks clear or contains any clumps or particles. \n\n \nStep 4: \n\n \n\u2022 Select a new Needle. \n\u2022 Pull off the Paper Tab from the Outer Needle Shield. \n \n \n \n\n \nStep 5: \n \n\u2022 Push the capped Needle straight onto the Pen  \n\nand twist the Needle on until it is tight. \n \n\n \n \n\nStep 6: \n \n\u2022 Pull off the Outer Needle Shield. Do not throw it away. \n\u2022 Pull off the Inner Needle Shield and throw it away. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n 165 \n\n \n \n\nPriming your Pen  \nPrime before each injection. \n\u2022 Priming your Pen means removing the air from the Needle and Cartridge that may collect \n\nduring normal use and ensures that the Pen is working correctly. \n\u2022 If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. \n \n\n \nStep 7: \n \n\u2022 To prime your Pen, turn the Dose Knob to select 2 units. \n \n \n \n\n \nStep 8: \n\u2022 Hold your Pen with the Needle pointing up. Tap the Cartridge  \n\nHolder gently to collect air bubbles at the top \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nStep 9: \n\n\u2022 Continue holding your Pen with Needle pointing \nup. Push the Dose Knob in until it stops, and \u201c0\u201d \nis seen in the Dose Window. Hold the Dose \nKnob in and count to 5 slowly. \n\n You should see insulin at the tip of the Needle. \n\n\u2013 If you do not see insulin, repeat the \npriming steps, but not more than 4 times. \n\n\u2013 If you still do not see insulin, change the \nNeedle and repeat the priming steps. \n\nSmall air bubbles are normal and will not affect \nyour dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSelecting your dose \n \n\u2022 You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. \n\u2022 If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than one injection. \n\n\u2013 If you need help deciding how to divide up your dose, ask your healthcare professional. \n\u2013 You should use a new Needle for each injection and repeat the priming step. \n\n \n\n\n\n 166 \n\nStep 10: \n\n\u2022 Turn the Dose Knob to select the \nnumber of units you need to inject. \nThe Dose Indicator should line up \nwith your dose. \n\n\u2013 The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. \n\n\u2013 The Dose Knob clicks as you \nturn it. \n\n\u2013 DO NOT dial your dose by \ncounting the clicks because \nyou may dial the wrong dose. \n\n\u2013 The dose can be corrected by \nturning the Dose Knob in \neither direction until the correct \ndose lines up with the Dose \nIndicator. \n\n\u2013 The even numbers are printed \non the dial. \n\n\u2013 The odd numbers, after the \nnumber 1, are shown as full \nlines. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Always check the number in the \nDose Window to make sure you \nhave dialled the correct dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(Example: 12 units \nshown in the Dose \nWindow) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(Example: 25 units \nshown in the Dose \nWindow) \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. \n\u2022 If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: \n\n\u2013 inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, or \n\u2013 get a new Pen and inject the full dose. \n\n\u2022 It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. \n \nGiving your injection \n \n\u2022 Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. \n\u2022 Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. \n\u2022 Do not try to change your dose while injecting. \n \n\nStep 11: \n\n\u2022 Choose your injection site. \n\nYour insulin is injected under the skin \n(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, \nbuttocks, upper legs or upper arms. \n\n\u2022 Wipe your skin with a swab, and let the \ninjection site dry before you inject your \ndose. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 167 \n\nStep 12: \n\n\u2022 Insert the Needle into your skin. \n\n\u2022 Push the Dose Knob all the way in. \n\n\u2022 Continue to hold the Dose \nKnob in and slowly count \nto 5 before removing the \nNeedle. \n\n \n\nDo not try to inject your insulin by turning the \nDose Knob. You will NOT receive your \ninsulin by turning the Dose Knob. \n\n \n \n\nStep 13: \n\n\u2022 Pull the Needle out of your skin. \n\n\u2013 A drop of insulin at the Needle \ntip is normal. It will not affect \nyour dose. \n\n\u2022 Check the number in the Dose Window \n\n\u2013 If you see \u201c0\u201d in the Dose \nwindow, you have received the \nfull amount you dialled. \n\n\u2013 If you do not see \u201c0\u201d in the Dose \nwindow, do not redial. Insert the \nneedle into your skin and finish \nyour injection. \n\n\u2013 If you still do not think you \nreceived the full amount you \ndialled for your injection, do not \nstart over or repeat that \ninjection. Monitor your blood \nglucose as instructed by your \nhealthcare professional. \n\n\u2013 If you normally need to give 2 \ninjections for your full dose, be \nsure to give your second \ninjection. \n\nThe plunger only moves a little with each \ninjection, and you may not notice that it \nmoves. \n\nIf you see blood after you take the Needle out \nof your skin, press the injection site lightly \nwith a piece of gauze or a swab. Do not rub \nthe area. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n5 sec \n\n\n\n 168 \n\nAfter your injection \n \n\n \nStep 14: \n\u2022 Carefully replace the Outer Needle Shield. \n \n \n \n \n\nStep 15: \n\n\u2022 Unscrew the capped Needle and dispose \nof it as described below (see Disposing \nof Pens and Needles section). \n\n\u2022 Do not store the Pen with the Needle \nattached to prevent leaking, blocking \nthe Needle, and air from entering the \nPen. \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 16: \n\n\u2022 Replace the Pen Cap by lining up the \nCap Clip with the Dose Indicator and \npushing straight on. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDisposing of pens and needles  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Put used Needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not \nthrow needles directly into your household waste. \n\n\u2022 Do not recycle the filled sharps container. \n\u2022 Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container \n\nproperly. \n\u2022 The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare \n\nprofessional or institutional policies. \n \n\nStoring your pen   \n\n \n\nUnused pens \n\n\u2022 Store unused Pens in the refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. \n\u2022 Do not freeze your insulin. Do not use if it has been frozen. \n\u2022 Unused Pens may be used until the expiration date printed on the Label, if the Pen has been kept \n\nin the refrigerator. \n \nIn-use Pen \n\u2022 Store the Pen you are currently using at room temperature up to 30\u00b0C and away from dust, food \n\nand liquids, heat and light. \n\u2022 Throw away the Pen you are using after the time specified in the Package Leaflet, even if it still \n\nhas insulin left in it. \n \n\n\n\n 169 \n\nGeneral information about the safe and effective use of your pen  \n\n\u2022 Keep your Pen and Needles out of the sight and reach of children. \n\u2022 Do not use your Pen if any part looks broken or damaged. \n\u2022 Always carry an extra Pen in case yours is lost or damaged. \n \nTroubleshooting \n\u2022 If you cannot remove the Pen Cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap \n\nstraight off. \n\u2022 If the Dose Knob is hard to push: \n\n\u2013 Pushing the Dose Knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. \n\u2013 Your Needle may be blocked. Put on a new Needle and prime the Pen. \n\u2013 You may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. \n\nYou may need to get a prescription from your healthcare professional. \n \nIf you have any questions or problems with your KwikPen, call your healthcare professional for help \nor contact your local Lilly affiliate \n \nDocument Revision Date:  \n\n\n\n 170 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen, solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\ninsulin lispro \nEach KwikPen delivers 1 \u2013 60 units in steps of 1 units. \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

What you need to know before you use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen \n3. How to use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is and what it is used for \n \nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is used to treat diabetes. Humalog works more quickly than normal \nhuman insulin because insulin lispro has been changed slightly in comparison to human insulin. \nInsulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural hormone made by the pancreas. \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your \nblood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It \nworks very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally \nuse Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.  \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen as well as a longer-acting insulin. \nEach kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change \nyour insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  \n \nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen should be reserved for the treatment of adults with diabetes requiring \ndaily doses of more than 20 units of rapid-acting insulin. \n \nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (600 units, \n200 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials \n1 unit at a time.  The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before \nyour injection. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  If your dose is more than \n60 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen \n \nDo NOT use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen  \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to \n\ndeal with mild hypoglycaemia (see section 3: If you take more Humalog than you need). \n \n\n\n\n 171 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 The Humalog 200 units/ml solution for injection in your pre-filled pen (the KwikPen) should \n\nONLY be injected with this pre-filled pen. Do not transfer the insulin lispro from your \nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will not \nmeasure your dose correctly. A severe overdose can result, causing low blood sugar which may put \nyour life in danger.  Do not transfer insulin from your Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen to any other \ninsulin delivery devices like insulin infusion pumps. \n\n\uf0b7 Do NOT mix the Humalog 200 units/ml solution for injection in your pre-filled pen (the \nKwikPen) with any other insulin or any other medicine. The Humalog 200 units/ml solution for \ninjection should not be diluted. \n\n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the \nwarning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed in section 4 \nof this leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and \nhow much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your \nblood glucose often. \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin \nhave reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have \nhypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse \n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n-  Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. \nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals \nat different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform \nyour doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness \nof breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n\uf0b7 This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone \ntrained to use the Pen. \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics, (e.g. metformin, acarbose, sulphonylurea agents, pioglitazone, \n\nempagliflozin, DPP-4-inhibitors like sitagliptin or saxagliptine, ), \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, used to treat an uncommon condition in which you \n\nmake too much growth hormone),  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201dsuch as salbutamol or terbutaline to treat asthma, or ritodrine used to stop \n\npremature labor, \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers \u2013 to treat high blood pressure., or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting (ACE) inhibitors, used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 specific medicines to treat high blood pressure, kidney damage due to diabetes, and some heart \n\nproblems  (angiotensin II receptor blockers). \n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. (see \nalso section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \n\n\n\n 172 \n\nHumalog with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.  Therefore the amount of insulin \nneeded may change. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you have: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen \n \nAlways check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin \nwhen you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen \nthat your doctor has told you to use. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if \nyou are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, \neven if the needle is changed. \n \nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen is for patients taking more than 20 units of rapid-acting insulin a day. \n \nDo not transfer insulin from your Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen to a syringe. The markings on \nthe insulin syringe will not measure your dose correctly. A severe overdose can result, causing \nlow blood sugar which may put your life in danger. \n \nDo not use Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in an insulin infusion pump. \n \nDosage \n\uf0b7 You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject \n\nsoon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, \nand how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes \nclinic regularly. \n\n\uf0b7 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\uf0b7 Inject Humalog under the skin (subcutaneously).  \n \nPreparing Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen  \n\uf0b7 Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if \n\nit looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time \nyou inject yourself. \n\n \n\n\n\n 173 \n\nGetting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) \n\uf0b7 First wash your hands. \n\uf0b7 Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions \n\ncarefully. Here are some reminders. \n\uf0b7 Use a clean needle. (Needles are not included). \n\uf0b7 Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air \n\nbubbles from your KwikPen. There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these \nare harmless. But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. \n\n \nInjecting Humalog  \n\uf0b7 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the \n\nskin, as you were taught. After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to \nmake sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area you have just injected. Make sure \nyou inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection and that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you \ninject, as you have been taught. It doesn\u2019t matter which injection site you use, either upper arm, \nthigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog injection will still work quicker than soluble human \ninsulin. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not inject Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection directly into a vein \n(intravenously). \n\n \nAfter injecting \n\uf0b7 As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer \n\nneedle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering the pen \nand your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the cap \non your pen. \n\n \nFurther injections \n\uf0b7 Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear any air \n\nbubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle pointing \nup.  \n\n\uf0b7 Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it again. Please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist \nor diabetes nurse will tell you how to do this. \n\n \nIf you take more Humalog than you need \nIf you take more Humalog than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar \n \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated, they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), loss of fluids \n(dehydration), unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d).  \n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always carry a spare pen in case you lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \n\n\n\n 174 \n\nIf you stop using Humalog. \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin \nunless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSevere allergy is rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating \nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, contact a doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).  Some people get redness, swelling or \nitching around the area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a \nfew weeks. If this happens to you, tell your doctor. \n \nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If \nyou notice your skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nHypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels (see section 2). \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness    \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness  \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache    \u2022 cold sweat \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as \ndriving a car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n 175 \n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy   \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face   \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst    \u2022 feeling or being sick \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse. Get medical help immediately. \n \nIllness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5.

There may be new information. This \ninformation does not take the place of talking to your healthcare professional about your medical \ncondition or your treatment. \n\nHumalog 200 units/ml KwikPen (\u201cPen\u201d) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (600 units, \n200 units/ml) of insulin lispro solution for injection. You can give yourself multiple doses using one \nPen. The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. You can inject from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose \nis more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection. The plunger only \nmoves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The plunger will only reach \nthe end of the cartridge when you have used all 600 units in the Pen. \n\nThis pen is designed to allow you to give more doses than other pens you may have used in the \npast. Dial your usual dose as instructed by your healthcare professional. \n\nHumalog KwikPen is available in two strengths, 100 units/ml and 200 units/ml. Inject Humalog \n200 units/ml ONLY with your Pen. DO NOT transfer insulin from your Pen to another insulin \ndelivery device. Syringes and insulin pumps will not dose 200 units/ml insulin correctly. A severe \noverdose can result, causing very low blood sugar which may put your life in danger. \n\nDo not share your Pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do not reuse or \nshare needles with other people.. You may give an infection to them or get an infection from \nthem.  \n\nThis Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone \ntrained to use the Pen. \n\nUSE ONLY IN THIS PEN, OR \nSEVERE OVERDOSE CAN RESULT \n\n\n\n 179 \n\n \nKwikPen Parts \n\n \n \n Pen Cap  Cartridge Holder Label  Dose Indicator \n\n \n\n \n \n \nDose \nKnob \n\nCap \nClip Rubber Seal   Plunger  Pen Body \n\nDose \nWindow \n\n \nPen Needle Parts \n\n(Needles Not Included) \nDose Knob \n\nwith burgundy ring \n  Needle   \n\n  \n\nOuter Needle \nShield \n\n Inner \nNeedle \nShield \n\n Paper Tab  \n\n \nHow to recognize your Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen: \n\n- Pen colour:  Dark grey \n- Dose Knob:  Dark grey with burgundy ring on the end \n- Labels:  Burgundy, \u201c200 units/ml\u201d in yellow box. \n\n Yellow warning on cartridge holder \n \nSupplies needed to give your injection: \n\n\uf0b7 Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen \n\uf0b7 KwikPen compatible Needle (BD [Becton, Dickinson and Company] Pen Needles \n\nrecommended) \n\uf0b7 Swab \n\nNeedles and swab are not included. \n \n \nPreparing your Pen \n\n\uf0b7 Wash your hands with soap and water. \n\n\uf0b7 Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if \nyou use more than 1 type of insulin.  \n\n\uf0b7 Do not use your Pen past the expiration date printed on the Label or for more than 28 days after \nyou first start using the Pen.  \n\n\uf0b7 Always use a new Needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked Needles.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nUSE ONLY IN THIS PEN OR SEVERE \nOVERDOSE CAN RESULT \n\n\n\n 180 \n\nStep 1: \n\nPull the Pen Cap straight off. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not remove the Pen Label. \n\nWipe the Rubber Seal with a swab.  \n\nHumalog 200 units/ml solution for injection \nshould look clear and colourless. Do not use if it \nis cloudy, coloured, or has particles or clumps in \nit. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nStep 2: \n\nSelect a new Needle. \n\nPull off the Paper Tab from the Outer Needle \nShield. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 3: \n\nPush the capped Needle straight onto the Pen \nand twist the Needle on until it is tight. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 4: \n\nPull off the Outer Needle Shield. Do not throw \nit away. \n\nPull off the Inner Needle Shield and throw it \naway.   \n\n \n \n\nUSE ONLY IN THIS PEN OR  \nSEVERE OVERDOSE CAN RESULT \n\n\n\n 181 \n\nPriming your Pen \n\nPrime before each injection.  \n\n\uf0b7 Priming your Pen means removing the air from the Needle and Cartridge that may collect during \nnormal use and ensures that the Pen is working correctly.  \n\n\uf0b7 If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin.  \n \n\nStep 5: \n\nTo prime your Pen, turn the Dose Knob to select \n2 units. \n\n \n \n\nStep 6: \n\nHold your Pen with the Needle pointing up. Tap \nthe Cartridge Holder gently to collect air bubbles \nat the top. \n\n \n \n\nStep 7: \n\nContinue holding your Pen with Needle pointing \nup. Push the Dose Knob in until it stops, and \u201c0\u201d \nis seen in the Dose Window. Hold the Dose Knob \nin and count to 5 slowly. \n\n\uf0b7 You should see insulin at the tip of the \nNeedle. \n\n\uf0a7 If you do not see insulin, repeat the \npriming steps, but not more than \n8 times. \n\n\uf0a7 If you still do not see insulin, change \nthe Needle and repeat the priming \nsteps. \n\nSmall air bubbles are normal and will not affect \nyour dose. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n 182 \n\n \nSelecting your dose \n\nThis pen has been designed to deliver the dose that is shown in the window. Dial your usual dose \nas instructed by your healthcare professional. \n\n\uf0b7 You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection.  \n\n\uf0b7 If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than one injection.  \n\n- If you need help deciding how to divide up your dose, ask your healthcare professional.  \n- You should use a new Needle for each injection and repeat the priming step.  \n \n\nStep 8: \n\nTurn the Dose Knob to select the number of units \nyou need to inject. The Dose Indicator should \nline up with your dose. \n\n\uf0b7 The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. \n\n\uf0b7 The Dose Knob clicks as you turn it. \n\n\uf0b7 DO NOT dial your dose by counting \nthe clicks because you may dial the \nwrong dose. \n\n\uf0b7 The dose can be corrected by turning \nthe Dose Knob in either direction until \nthe correct dose lines up with the Dose \nIndicator. \n\n\uf0b7 The even numbers are printed on the \ndial.  \n\n\uf0b7 The odd numbers, after the number 1, \nare shown as full lines. \n\nAlways check the number in the Dose Window \nto make sure you have dialled the correct \ndose.  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n   (Example: 12 units shown in the \nDose Window) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n   (Example: 25 units shown in the \nDose Window) \n\n \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen.  \n\n\uf0b7 If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either:  \n\n- inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, or \n- get a new Pen and inject the full dose.  \n\n\n\n 183 \n\nGiving your injection \n\n\uf0b7 Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you.  \n\n\uf0b7 Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection.  \n\n\uf0b7 Do not try to change your dose while injecting.  \n\n \n\nStep 9: \n\nChoose your injection site. \n\nHumalog 200 units/ml solution for injection is \ninjected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your \nstomach area, buttocks, upper legs or upper \narms. \n\nWipe your skin with a swab, and let your skin \ndry before you inject your dose. \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 10: \n\nInsert the Needle into your skin. \n\nPush the Dose Knob all the way in.  \n\n \n\n \n\nContinue to hold the Dose Knob in \nand slowly count to 5 before \nremoving the Needle. \n\nDo not try to inject your insulin by turning the \nDose Knob. You will NOT receive your insulin \nby turning the Dose Knob. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 11: \n\nPull the Needle out of your skin. \n\n\uf0b7 A drop of insulin at the Needle tip is \nnormal. It will not affect your dose.  \n\n\uf0b7 Check the number in the Dose \nWindow.If you see \u201c0\u201d in the Dose \nWindow, you have received the full \namount you dialled.  \n\n\uf0b7 If you do not see \u201c0\u201d in the Dose \nWindow, do not redial. Insert the \nneedle into your skin and finish your \ninjection. \n\n\uf0b7 If you still do not think you received \nthe full amount you dialled for your \ninjection, do not start over or repeat \nthat injection. Monitor your blood \nglucose as instructed by your \nhealthcare professional. \n\nThe plunger only moves a little with each \ninjection and you may not notice that it moves. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 184 \n\nIf you see blood after you take the Needle out of \nyour skin, press the injection site lightly with a \npiece of gauze or a swab. Do not rub the area. \n\n \nAfter your injection \n \n\nStep 12: \n\nCarefully replace the Outer Needle Shield. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 13: \n\nUnscrew the capped Needle and dispose of it as \ndescribed below (see Disposing of Pens and \nNeedles section). \n\nDo not store the Pen with the Needle attached to \nprevent leaking, blocking the Needle, and air \nfrom entering the Pen. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 14: \n\nReplace the Pen Cap by lining up the Cap Clip \nwith the Dose Indicator and pushing straight on. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nDisposing of Pens and Needles \n\n\uf0b7 Put used Needles in a sharps container or hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not \nthrow needles directly into your household waste.  \n\n\uf0b7 Do not recycle the filled sharps container. \n\uf0b7 Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container \n\nproperly. \n\uf0b7 The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare \n\nprofessional or institutional policies. \n \nStoring your Pen \n\nUnused Pens \n\n\uf0b7 Store unused Pens in the refrigerator at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not freeze Humalog 200 units/ml solution for injection. Do not use if it has been frozen.  \n\n\uf0b7 Unused Pens may be used until the expiration date printed on the Label, if the Pen has been \nkept in the refrigerator.  \n\n\n\n 185 \n\nIn-use Pen \n\n\uf0b7 Store the Pen you are currently using at room temperature (up to 30\u00b0C) and away from dust, \nfood and liquids, heat and light. \n\n\uf0b7 Throw away the Pen you are using after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. \n \nGeneral information about the safe and effective use of your Pen \n\n\uf0b7 Keep your Pen and Needles out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not use your Pen if any part looks broken or damaged. \n\n\uf0b7 Always carry an extra Pen in case yours is lost or damaged. \n\nTroubleshooting \n\n\uf0b7 If you cannot remove the Pen Cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap \nstraight off. \n\n\uf0b7 If the Dose Knob is hard to push;  \n\n- Pushing the Dose Knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. \n- Your Needle may be blocked. Put on a new Needle and prime the Pen. \n- You may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new \n\nPen. You may need to get a prescription from your healthcare professional. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not transfer insulin from the Pen to a syringe or an insulin pump. Severe overdose \ncan result. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions or problems with your Humalog 200 units/ml KwikPen, call your healthcare \nprofessional for help or contact your local Lilly affiliate.  \n\n \nDocument revision date:  \n\n\n\n 186 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nHumalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen, solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\ninsulin lispro \nEach Junior KwikPen delivers 0.5 \u2013 30 units in steps of 0.5 units. \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

What you need to know before you use Humalog Junior KwikPen \n3. How to use Humalog Junior KwikPen \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Humalog Junior KwikPen \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Humalog Junior KwikPen is and what it is used for \n \nHumalog Junior KwikPen is used to treat diabetes. Humalog works more quickly than normal human \ninsulin because insulin lispro has been changed slightly in comparison to human insulin. Insulin lispro \nis closely related to human insulin which is a natural hormone made by the pancreas. \n \nYou get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your \nblood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It \nworks very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally \nuse Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.  \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Humalog as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of insulin \ncomes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin unless \nyour doctor tells you to.  \n \nHumalog is suitable for use in adults and children.  \n \nHumalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, \n100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin.  The KwikPen dials \nhalf unit (0.5 unit) at a time. The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check \nthis before your injection. You can give from 0.5 unit to 30 units in a single injection.  If your dose \nis more than 30 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Humalog Junior KwikPen   \n \nDo NOT use Humalog Junior KwikPen  \n- if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to \n\ndeal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog than you need). \n \n\n\n\n 187 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\uf0b7 Do NOT mix the Humalog 100 units/ml solution for injection in your pre-filled pen (the \n\nJunior KwikPen) with any other insulins or any other medicine.  \n\uf0b7 If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the \n\nwarning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed in section 4 \nof this leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and \nhow much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your \nblood glucose often. \n\n\uf0b7 A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin \nhave reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have \nhypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n\uf0b7 If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse \n- Have you recently become ill? \n- Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? \n-  Are you exercising more than usual? \n\n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. \nThe time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals \nat different times from when you are at home. \n\n\uf0b7 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform \nyour doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness \nof breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n\uf0b7 This Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone \ntrained to use the Pen. \n\n \nOther medicines and Humalog Junior KwikPen  \nYour insulin needs may change if you are taking  \n\n\uf0b7 the contraceptive pill,  \n\uf0b7 steroids,  \n\uf0b7 thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  \n\uf0b7 oral hypoglycaemics, (e.g. metformin, acarbose, sulphonylurea agents, pioglitazone, \n\nempagliflozin, DPP-4-inhibitors like sitagliptin or saxagliptine, ), \n\uf0b7 acetyl salicylic acid,  \n\uf0b7 sulpha antibiotics,  \n\uf0b7 somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, used to treat an uncommon condition in which you \n\nmake too much growth hormone),  \n\uf0b7 \u201cbeta2 stimulants\u201dsuch as salbutamol or terbutaline to treat asthma, or ritodrine used to stop \n\npremature labor, \n\uf0b7 beta-blockers \u2013 to treat high blood pressure., or  \n\uf0b7 some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),  \n\uf0b7 danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  \n\uf0b7 some angiotensin converting (ACE) inhibitors, used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure (for example captopril, enalapril), and  \n\uf0b7 specific medicines to treat high blood pressure, kidney damage due to diabetes, and some heart \n\nproblems  (angiotensin II receptor blockers). \n \nPlease tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. (see \nalso section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nHumalog with alcohol \n \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.  Therefore the amount of insulin \nneeded may change. \n \n\n\n\n 188 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAre you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of \ninsulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the \nremaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \nAsk your doctor for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you \nhave: \n\uf0b7 frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n\uf0b7 reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Humalog Junior KwikPen \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Humalog Junior KwikPen  \n \nAlways check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin \nwhen you get it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog 100 units/ml Junior \nKwikPen that your doctor has told you to use. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if \nyou are not sure. To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, \neven if the needle is changed. \n \nDosage \n\uf0b7 The number of half units (0.5 units) is shown in the dose window of your pen. The half units \n\n(0.5 units) are shown as lines between the numbers. \n\uf0b7 Always check the number in the dose window to make sure you have dialled the correct dose. \n\uf0b7 You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject \n\nsoon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, \nand how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes \nclinic regularly. \n\n\uf0b7 If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a \nHumalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the \nfirst injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n\n\uf0b7 Humalog KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you \nneed to inject your insulin by another method.   \n\nPreparing Humalog Junior KwikPen  \n\u2022 Humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. But you must use it only if \n\nit looks like water. It must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. Check each time \nyou inject yourself. \n\n \nGetting the Junior KwikPen ready to use (Please see user manual) \n\u2022 First wash your hands. \n\u2022 Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions \n\ncarefully. Here are some reminders. \n\u2022 Use a clean needle. (Needles are not included). \n\u2022 Prime your Junior KwikPen  before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the \n\nair bubbles from your Junior KwikPen . There may still be some small air bubbles left in the \npen - these are harmless. But if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose. \n\n \n\n\n\n 189 \n\nInjecting Humalog  \n\u2022 Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the \n\nskin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle \nin the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area \nyou have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection \nand that you \u2018rotate\u2019 the places you inject, as you have been taught. It doesn\u2019t matter which \ninjection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your Humalog injection will \nstill work quicker than soluble human insulin. \n\n\u2022 You must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route. Inject Humalog as your physician \nor nurse has taught you. Only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route. \nHe will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your \nglucose levels are too high. \n\n \nAfter injecting \n\u2022 As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the Junior KwikPen using the \n\nouter needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering \nthe pen and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace \nthe cap on your pen. \n\n \nFurther injections \n\u2022 Every time you use a Junior KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear \n\nany air bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the Junior KwikPen with the \nneedle pointing up. The scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left. \n\n\u2022 Once the Junior KwikPen is empty, do not use it again. Please get rid of it carefully - your \npharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do this. \n\n \nUsing Humalog in an infusion pump \n\u2022 Junior KwikPen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin.  Do not use the pen to \n\nadminister Humalog by a different way.  Other forms of Humalog 100 units/ml are available if \nthis is necessary.  Speak to your doctor if this applies to you. \n\n \nIf you take more Humalog than you need \nIf you take more Humalog than you need, a low blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. \nThen eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will \noften get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your \nbreathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat \nquite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to \nglucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. \n \nIf you forget to use Humalog \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur.  Check your blood sugar \n \nIf hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be \nvery serious and cause headaches, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), loss of fluids \n(dehydration), unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d).  \n \nThree simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\u2022 Always carry a spare pen in case you lose your Junior KwikPen or it gets damaged. \n\u2022 Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n\u2022 Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you stop using Humalog. \nIf you take less Humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your insulin \nunless your doctor tells you to. \n \n\n\n\n 190 \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSevere allergy is rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). The symptoms are as follows: \n\u2022 rash over the whole body  \u2022 blood pressure dropping \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing  \u2022 heart beating fast \n\u2022 wheezing    \u2022 sweating \n \nIf you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, contact a doctor at once. \n \nLocal allergy is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).  Some people get redness, swelling or \nitching around the area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a \nfew weeks. If this happens to you, tell your doctor. \n \nLipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If \nyou notice your skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. \n \nOedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of \ninsulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nHypoglycaemia  \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n\u2022 you take too much Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n\u2022 you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n\u2022 you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n\u2022 there is a change in your need for insulin; or \n\u2022 you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n \nAlcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels (see section 2). \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n\u2022 tiredness    \u2022 rapid heartbeat \n\u2022 nervousness or shakiness  \u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 headache    \u2022 cold sweat \n \nWhile you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as \ndriving a car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nHyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. \nHyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n\u2022 not taking your Humalog or other insulin; \n\u2022 taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; \n\u2022 eating a lot more than your diet allows; or \n\n\n\n 191 \n\n\u2022 fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. The symptoms include the following: \n\u2022 feeling sleepy  \u2022 no appetite \n\u2022 flushed face   \u2022 fruity smell on the breath \n\u2022 thirst    \u2022 feeling or being sick \n \nSevere symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse.  Get medical help immediately. \n \nIllness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n\u2018sick rules\u2019, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5.

There may be new information. This information does not take the \nplace of talking to your healthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. \n\nHumalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen (\u201cPen\u201d) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml \n(300 units, 100 units/ml) of insulin lispro solution for injection.  One pen contains multiple doses of \ninsulin. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Your healthcare professional will tell you how many units to give as your dose and how to \ninject your prescribed dose of insulin. \n\n\u2022 The Pen dials half unit (0.5 unit) at a time. You can give from 0.5 unit to 30 units in a single \ninjection.  \n\n\u2022 Always check the number in the dose window to make sure you have dialed the correct dose. \n\n\u2022 If your dose is more than 30 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  \n\n\u2022 The Plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. When \nthe Plunger reaches the end of the cartridge, you have used all 300 units in the Pen. \n\nDo not share your Pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do not reuse or \nshare needles with other people. You may give an infection to them or get an infection from \nthem. \n\nThis Pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the help of someone \ntrained to use the Pen. \n\n \n\nHumalog Junior KwikPen Parts \n Pen Cap  Cartridge Holder  Label Dose Indicator \n\n \n\n \n Cap Clip Rubber Seal Plunger Pen Body Dose \n\nWindow \nDose \nKnob \n\n \n\n\n\n 195 \n\nPen Needle Parts \n(Needles Not Included) \n\n Dose Knob \nBlue, with raised ridges \n\non end and side \n\n \n  Paper Tab   \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \nOuter Needle \n\nShield \nInner Needle \n\nShield \nNeedle    \n\n \n \n \nHow to recognize your Humalog Junior KwikPen: \n\u2022 Pen colour: Blue \n\n\u2022 Dose Knob: Blue, with raised ridges on end and side \n\n\u2022 Label: White with an orange colour bar and orange-to-yellow and burgundy colour band \n\n \nSupplies needed to give your injection: \n\u2022 Humalog Junior KwikPen \n\n\u2022 KwikPen compatible Needle (BD [Becton, Dickinson and Company] Pen Needles recommended) \n\n\u2022 Swab \n\nNeedles and swab are not included. \n \n\nPreparing your Pen \n\u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \n\n\u2022 Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if \nyou use more than 1 type of insulin. \n\n\u2022 Do not use your Pen past the expiration date printed on the Label or for more than 28 days after \nyou first start using the Pen. \n\n\u2022 Always use a new Needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked Needles.  \n\n \nStep 1: \n\u2022 Pull the Pen Cap straight off. \n\n\u2013 Do not remove the Pen Label. \n\n\u2022 Wipe the Rubber Seal with a swab. \n\nHumalog should look clear and colourless. Do not \nuse if it is cloudy, coloured, or has particles or clumps \nin it. \n\n \n\n\n\n 196 \n\nStep 2: \n\u2022 Select a new Needle. \n\n\u2022 Pull off the Paper Tab from the Outer Needle \nShield. \n\n \n\nStep 3: \n\u2022 Push the capped Needle straight onto the Pen and \n\ntwist the Needle on until it is tight. \n\n \n\nStep 4: \n\u2022 Pull off the Outer Needle Shield. Do not throw it \n\naway. \n\n\u2022 Pull off the Inner Needle Shield and throw it \naway. \n\n \n\n \n \nPriming your Pen \nPrime before each injection. \n\u2022 Priming your Pen means removing the air from the Needle and Cartridge that may collect during \n\nnormal use. It is important to prime your Pen so that it will work correctly. \n\n\u2022 If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. \n\n \nStep 5: \n\u2022 To prime your Pen, turn the Dose Knob to select \n\n2 units. \n\n \n\n \nStep 6: \n\u2022 Hold your Pen with the Needle pointing up. Tap \n\nthe Cartridge Holder gently to collect air bubbles \nat the top. \n\n \n\nKeep Throw \nAway \n\n\n\n 197 \n\nStep 7: \n\u2022 Continue holding your Pen with the Needle \n\npointing up. Push the Dose Knob in until it stops, \nand \u201c0\u201d is seen in the Dose Window. Hold the \nDose Knob in and count to 5 slowly. \n\nYou should see insulin at the tip of the Needle. \n\n\u2013 If you do not see insulin, repeat the priming \nsteps, but not more than 4 times. \n\n\u2013 If you still do not see insulin, change the \nNeedle and repeat the priming steps. \n\nSmall air bubbles are normal and will not affect your \ndose. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nSelecting your dose \n\u2022 You can give from half unit (0.5 unit) to 30 units in a single injection. \n\nAlways check the number in the Dose Window to make sure you have dialled the correct dose. \n\n \n\n\u2022 If your dose is more than 30 units, you will need to give more than one injection. \n\n\u2013  Talk to your healthcare professional about how to give your dose. \n\n\u2013 Use a new Needle for each injection and repeat the priming step. \n\n\u2013 If you usually need more than 30 units, ask your healthcare professional if a different \nHumalog KwikPen would be better for you. \n\n\n\n 198 \n\n \nStep 8: \n\u2022 Turn the Dose Knob to select the number of units \n\nyou need to inject. The Dose Indicator should line \nup with your dose. \n\n\u2013 The Pen dials half unit (0.5 unit) at a time. \n\n\u2013 The Dose Knob clicks as you turn it. \n\n\u2013 DO NOT dial your dose by counting the \nclicks because you may dial the wrong dose. \n\n\u2013 The dose can be corrected by turning the Dose \nKnob in either direction until the correct dose \nlines up with the Dose Indicator. \n\n\u2013 The whole unit numbers are printed on the \ndial. \n\n \n \n \n\n\u2013 The half units  are shown as  lines between \nthe numbers. \n\n \n \n\u2022 Always check the number in the Dose Window \n\nto make sure you have dialled the correct dose. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nExample: 4 units \nshown in the  \nDose Window \n\n \n \n\n \nExample: 10 \u00bd (10.5) \nunits shown in the \nDose Window \n\n \n\u2022 The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. \n\n\u2022 If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: \n\n\u2013 inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, or \n\n\u2013 get a new Pen and inject the full dose. \n\n\u2022 It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you can not inject. \n\n \nGiving your injection \n\u2022 Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. \n\n\u2022 Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. \n\n\u2022 Do not try to change your dose while injecting. \n\n \nStep 9: \n\u2022 Choose your injection site. \n\n Humalog is injected under the skin \n(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, \nbuttocks, upper legs or upper arms. \n\n\u2022 Wipe your skin with a swab, and let your \nskin dry before you inject your dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 199 \n\nStep 10: \n\u2022 Insert the Needle into your skin. \n\n\u2022 Push the Dose Knob all the way in. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Continue to hold the Dose \nKnob in and slowly count to 5 \nbefore removing the Needle. \n\nDo not try to inject your insulin by \nturning the Dose Knob. You will \nNOT receive your insulin by \nturning the Dose Knob. \n\n \n\nStep 11: \n\u2022 Pull the Needle out of your skin. \n\n\u2013 A drop of insulin at the Needle tip is normal. It \nwill not affect your dose. \n\n\u2022 Check the number in the Dose Window \n\n- If you see \u201c0\u201d in the Dose window, you have \nreceived the full amount you dialled. \n\n- If you do not see \u201c0\u201d in the Dose window, you \ndid not receive your full dose. Do not redial. \nInsert the needle into your skin and finish your \ninjection. \n\n- If you still do not think you received the full \namount you dialled for your injection, do not \nstart over or repeat that injection. Monitor \nyour blood glucose and call your healthcare \nprofessional for further instructions. \n\nThe plunger only moves a little with each injection, \nand you may not notice that it moves. \n\nIf you see blood after you take the Needle out of your \nskin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of \ngauze or a swab. Do not rub the area. \n\n \n\n \n\n5sec \n\n\n\n 200 \n\n \nAfter your injection \nStep 12: \n\u2022 Carefully replace the Outer Needle Shield. \n\n \n\nStep 13: \n\u2022 Unscrew the capped Needle and dispose of it as \n\ndescribed below (see Disposing of Pens and \nNeedles section). \n\n\u2022 Do not store the Pen with the Needle attached to \nprevent leaking, blocking the Needle, and air \nfrom entering the Pen. \n\n \n\nStep 14: \n\u2022 Replace the Pen Cap by lining up the Cap Clip \n\nwith the Dose Indicator and pushing straight on. \n\n \n\n \n \nDisposing of Pens and Needles \n\u2022 Put used Needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw \n\nneedles directly into your household waste.  \n\n\u2022 Do not recycle the filled sharps container. \n\n\u2022 Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container \nproperly. \n\n\u2022 The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare professional \nor institutional policies. \n\nStoring your Pen \nUnused Pens \n\u2022 Store unused Pens in the refrigerator at (2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C). \n\n\u2022 Do not freeze Humalog. Do not use if it has been frozen. \n\n\u2022 Unused Pens may be used until the expiration date printed on the Label, if the Pen has been kept \nin the refrigerator. \n\nIn-use Pen \n\u2022 Store the Pen you are currently using at room temperature [up to (30 \u00b0C)] and away from dust, \n\nfood and liquids, heat and light. \n\n\u2022 Throw away the Pen you are using after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. \n\n \nGeneral information about the safe and effective use of your Pen \n\u2022 Keep your Pen and Needles out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n\u2022 Do not use your Pen if any part looks broken or damaged. \n\n\u2022 Always carry an extra Pen in case yours is lost or damaged. \n\n\n\n 201 \n\n \n \nTroubleshooting \n\u2022 If you can not remove the Pen Cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap \n\nstraight off. \n\n\u2022 If the Dose Knob is hard to push: \n\n\u2013 Pushing the Dose Knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. \n\n\u2013 Your Needle may be blocked. Put on a new Needle and prime the Pen. \n\n\u2013 You may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. \nYou may need to get a prescription from your healthcare professional. \n\nIf you have any questions or problems with your Humalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen, call your \nhealthcare professional for help or contact your local Lilly affiliate.  \n\n \nDocument revision date:  \n \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

warnings and precautions if your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. warning signs are listed later in this leaflet. you must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. you must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood glucose often. a few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. if you often have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor. if you answer yes to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse - have you recently become ill? - do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver? - are you exercising more than usual? the amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol. you should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. the time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals at different times from when you are at home. some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling

or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription (see section \"warnings and precautions\"). pregnancy and breast-feeding are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? the amount of insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining six months. if you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. ask your doctor for advice. driving and using machines your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. please keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery). you should contact your doctor

the insulin when you get it from your pharmacy. make sure you get the humalog that your doctor has told you to use. always use humalog exactly as your doctor has told you. you should check with your doctor if you are not sure. dosage you should normally inject humalog within 15 minutes of a meal. if you need to, you can inject soon after a meal. but your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, and how often. these instructions are only for you. follow them exactly and visit your diabetes clinic regularly. if you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. this might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months. inject humalog under the skin. you should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told you to. preparing humalog humalog is already dissolved in water, so you do not need to mix it. but you must use it only if it looks like water. it must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. check each time you inject yourself. injecting humalog first wash your hands. before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. clean the rubber stopper on the vial, but do not remove the stopper. use a clean, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of humalog you want. your doctor or clinic will tell you how to do this. do not share your needles and syringes. inject under the skin, as you were taught. do not inject directly into a vein. after your injection, leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. do not rub the area you have just injected. make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection and that you 'rotate' the places you inject, as you have been taught. it doesn't matter which injection site you use, either upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen, your humalog injection will still work quicker than soluble human insulin. your doctor will tell you if you have to mix humalog with one of the human insulins. for example if you do need to inject a mixture, draw the humalog into the syringe before the long acting insulin. inject the liquid as soon as you have mixed it. do the same thing every time. you should not normally mix humalog with one of the mixtures of human insulins. you should never mix humalog with insulins produced by other manufacturers or animal insulins. you must not administer humalog by the intravenous route. inject humalog as your physician or nurse has taught you. only your physician can administer humalog by the intravenous route. he will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your glucose levels are too high. using humalog in an infusion pump only certain ce-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro. before infusing insulin lispro, the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the suitability or otherwise for the particular pump. read and follow the instructions in the product literature supplied with the infusion pump. be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump. changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in the product information supplied with the infusion set. in the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped until the episode is resolved. if repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur, notify your doctor or clinic and consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion. a pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels. if an interruption to insulin flow is suspected, follow the instructions in the product literature and if appropriate, notify your doctor or clinic. when used with an insulin infusion pump, humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin. if you take more humalog than you need if you take more humalog than you need, a low blood sugar may occur. check your blood sugar. if your blood sugar is low (mild hypoglycaemia), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. this will often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. if you get worse and your breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. a glucagon injection can treat quite severe hypoglycaemia. eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. if you do not respond to glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon. if you forget to use humalog if you take less humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. check your blood sugar. if hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see a and b in section 4 \"possible side effects\"). three simple steps to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of humalog. always carry something to show you are diabetic. always carry sugar with you. if you stop using humalog. if you take less humalog than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. if you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "humalog", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "the insulin", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 66, "EndOffset": 77},

"like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. systemic allergy is rare ( 1/10,000 to <1/1,000). the symptoms are as follows: rash over the whole body blood pressure dropping difficulty in breathing heart beating fast wheezing sweating. if you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with humalog, tell your doctor at once. local allergy is common ( 1/100 to <1/10). some people get redness, swelling or itching around the area of the insulin injection. this usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. if this happens to you, tell your doctor. lipodystrophy (thickening or pitting of the skin) is uncommon ( 1/1,000 to <1/100). if you notice your skin thickening or pitting at the injection site, tell your doctor. oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 106 listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. common problems of diabetes a. hypoglycaemia hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. this can be caused if: you take too much humalog or other insulin; you miss or delay meals or change your diet; you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); there is a change in your need for insulin; or you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels. the first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: tiredness rapid heartbeat nervousness or shakiness feeling sick headache cold sweat. while you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. b. hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin. hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: not taking your humalog or other insulin; taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to; eating a lot more than your diet allows; or fever, infection or emotional stress. hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. the first symptoms come on slowly over many hours or days. the symptoms include the following: feeling sleepy no appetite flushed face fruity smell on the breath thirst feeling or being sick severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse. get medical help immediately. c. illness if you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. even when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. test your urine or blood, follow your 'sick rules', and tell your doctor.", "Entity_Recognition":
