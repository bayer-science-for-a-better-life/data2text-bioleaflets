NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRasilamlo 150 mg/5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate) and 5 mg amlodipine (as \n\nbesylate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nLight yellow, convex, ovaloid tablet with a bevelled edge, with “T2” debossed on one side and \n\n“NVR” on the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasilamlo is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adult patients whose blood \n\npressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine used alone. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasilamlo is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is manifested within 1 week and the effect is near maximal at around \n\n4 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy, the dose may be \n\ntitrated up to a maximum of 300 mg aliskiren/10 mg amlodipine. Dose should be individualised and \n\nadjusted according to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo may be administered with other antihypertensive medicinal products with the exception of \n\nuse in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPosology in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine monotherapy  \n\nRasilamlo 150 mg/5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with aliskiren 150 mg or amlodipine 5 mg alone. \n\n \n\nA patient who experiences dose limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be \n\nswitched to Rasilamlo containing a lower dose of that component to achieve similar blood pressure \n\nreductions. \n\n \n\nIndividual dose titration with each of the two components may be recommended before changing to \n\nthe fixed combination. When clinically appropriate and in line with the above-mentioned posology, \n\ndirect change from monotherapy to the fixed combination may be considered. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(GFR 89-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively, see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nRasilamlo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nAmlodipine dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine have not been studied in severe hepatic \n\nimpairment; therefore, caution should be exercised when administering Rasilamlo to patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nElderly people (over 65 years) \n\nThere is limited experience with Rasilamlo, in particular in patients aged 75 years or older. \n\nTherefore, particular caution should be exercised in these patients. The recommended starting dose of \n\naliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful additional blood pressure reduction \n\nis observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasilamlo in children below age 18 have not been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in \n\nchildren aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasilamlo should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Concomitant intake with fruit juice \n\nand/or drinks containing plant extracts (including herbal teas) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or \nother dihydropyridine derivatives. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of Rasilamlo with an ACEI or an ARB is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis). \n- Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n- Children from birth to less than 2 years (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasilamlo therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients \n\nwith ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial \n\ninfarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and decreased renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the RAAS by combining aliskiren with an ACEI \n\nor an ARB is therefore not recommended. If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely \n\nnecessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring \n\nof renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nNo data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are available for aliskiren in patients with heart \n\nfailure (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasilamlo in the following \n\ncases: \n\n Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasilamlo, or the \n\ntreatment should start under close medical supervision. In patients with uncomplicated hypertension \n\ntreated with Rasilamlo in short-term controlled trials, the incidence of hypotension was low (0.2%). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn clinical studies aliskiren has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (serum creatinine ≥150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and ≥177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \n\nmen and/or estimated GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or \n\nrenovascular hypertension. Rasilamlo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, caution should be \n\nexercised when Rasilamlo is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction \n\nsuch as hypovolaemia (e.g. due to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, \n\netc.), heart disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible \n\nupon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-\n\nmarketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be promptly \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n5 \n\nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and \n\nthese may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic \n\ndetermination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe half life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \n\nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. Caution should be exercised when \n\nadministering Rasilamlo to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \n\nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasilamlo in patients with unilateral or \n\nbilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal \n\nproducts acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal \n\ninsufficiency, including acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with \n\naliskiren. Therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment \n\nshould be discontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, \n\nthroat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal products that can cause angioedema, including \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasilamlo should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n6 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAliskiren is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and there is a potential for aliskiren overexposure in \n\nchildren with an immature P-gp drug transporter system. The age at which the transporter system is \n\nmature cannot be determined (see sections 5.2 and 5.3). Therefore, Rasilamlo is contraindicated in \n\nchildren from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years. \n\n \n\nLimited safety data are available from a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 \n\nhypertensive children aged 6 to less than 18 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasilamlo interactions \n\nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Rasilamlo. Therefore, \n\ninformation on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual active \n\nsubstances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren and amlodipine does not cause meaningful changes in the steady-state \n\npharmacokinetic exposure (AUC) and the maximum concentration (Cmax) of either component in \n\nhealthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nInformation on aliskiren interactions \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n- P-gp potent inhibitors \nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The \n\nincrease may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) \n\nincreases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, \n\nconcomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n- Fruit juice and drinks containing plant extracts \nAdministration of fruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. Co-\n\nadministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC \n\nand co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. Co-\n\nadministration of orange or apple juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 62% decrease in aliskiren \n\nAUC or in a 63% decrease in aliskiren AUC, respectively. This decrease is likely due to an \n\ninhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by components of \n\nfruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, fruit juice \n\nshould not be taken together with Rasilamlo. The effect of drinks containing plant extracts (including \n\nherbal teas) on the absorption of aliskiren has not been investigated. However, compounds potentially \n\ninhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren are widely present in \n\nfruits, vegetables, and many other plant products. Therefore, drinks containing plant extracts, \n\nincluding herbal teas, should not be taken together with Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the RAAS with aliskiren, ARBs or ACEIs \n\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACEIs, \n\nARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, stroke, \n\nhyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a \n\nsingle RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n7 \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- P-gp interactions \nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption \n\nand biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies (see section 5.2). Rifampicin, which is an \n\ninducer of P-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other \n\ninducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has \n\nnot been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of \n\nsubstrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp \n\ninhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at \n\nthe P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\n- Moderate P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved \n\nif the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. \n\n \n\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, NSAIDs may \n\nreduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function \n\n(dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in \n\nfurther deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually \n\nreversible. Therefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\n- Furosemide and torasemide \nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see interaction with organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n- Warfarin \nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\n- Food interactions \nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). The available clinical data do not suggest an additive effect of different types of \nfoods and/or drinks, however the potential for decreased aliskiren bioavailability due to this additive \n\neffect has not been studied and therefore cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of aliskiren \n\nwith fruit juice or drinks containing plant extracts, including herbal teas, should be avoided. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of aliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with fruit juice). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n9 \n\nInformation on amlodipine interactions \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on amlodipine \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibitors \nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, \n\nazole antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give \n\nrise to significant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers \nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\n- Grapefruit juice \nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\n- Dantrolene (infusion) \nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nEffects of amlodipine on other medicinal products \n\n- The blood pressure lowering effects of amlodipine adds to the blood pressure-lowering effects \nof other antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in \na 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to \n\nlimit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, \ndigoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\nHealthcare professionals prescribing Rasilamlo should counsel women of childbearing potential about \n\nthe potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment \n\nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasilamlo should not be used in \n\nwomen planning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, \n\naliskiren should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy and is contraindicated during the \n\nsecond and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n10 \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. Reproductive studies in rats \n\nhave shown no toxicity except for delayed date of delivery and prolonged duration of labour at \n\ndosages 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans (see section 5.3). Use \n\nin pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself \n\ncarries greater risk for the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasilamlo is contraindicated \n\nduring the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasilamlo should be discontinued accordingly as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was \n\nsecreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n\n \n\nSince there is insufficient/limited information on the excretion of aliskiren and amlodipine in human \n\nor animal breast milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It is therefore not \n\nrecommended for women who are breast-feeding to use Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \n\nRasilamlo therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \n\ntherapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility with the use of Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\nThe fertility of rats was unaffected at doses of up to aliskiren 250 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nWhen driving vehicles or using machines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may \n\noccasionally occur when taking Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If \n\npatients taking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea, the ability to react may \n\nbe impaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety profile of Rasilamlo presented below is based on clinical studies performed with \n\nRasilamlo and the known safety profile of the individual components aliskiren and amlodipine. \n\nSafety information for Rasilamlo in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions for Rasilamlo are hypotension and peripheral oedema. The \n\nadverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components of Rasilamlo (aliskiren \n\nand amlodipine) and included in the tabulated list of adverse reactions may occur with Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n11 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \n\nconvention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare  \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata).

A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \n\nuncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in hypertensive \n\npatients, aliskiren had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \n\ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other medicinal products acting on \n\nthe RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nBased on the limited amount of safety data available from a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren \n\ntreatment in 39 hypertensive children 6-17 years of age, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \n\nreactions in children are expected to be similar to that seen in hypertensive adults. As for other RAAS \n\nblockers, headache is a common adverse event in children treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nExceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n14 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Rasilamlo. The most likely manifestation of overdose for \n\nRasilamlo would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren and amlodipine. \n\n \n\nWith aliskiren, the most likely manifestation of overdose would be hypotension, related to the \n\nantihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nWith amlodipine, available data suggest that gross overdose could result in excessive peripheral \n\nvasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension \n\nup to and including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur with Rasilamlo, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \n\n \n\nA vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is \n\nno contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the \n\neffects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to \n\n2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of \n\namlodipine. \n\n \n\nSince amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (<2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, renin inhibitors, ATC \n\ncode: C09XA53 \n\n \n\nRasilamlo combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control \n\nblood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: aliskiren belongs to the class of direct renin \n\ninhibitors and amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n15 \n\nRasilamlo \n\nThe use of combined treatment with aliskiren and amlodipine arises from the actions of these two \n\nmedicinal products on different but complementary systems that regulate blood pressure. Calcium \n\nchannel blockers act to prevent the influx of calcium into the vascular smooth muscle cells in the \n\nvessel wall, thereby preventing smooth muscle cell contraction and vasoconstriction. Renin inhibitors \n\nsuppress the enzymatic activity of renin, and thereby block the formation of Angiotensin II, the major \n\neffector molecule of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Angiotensin II causes \n\nvasoconstriction and sodium and water reabsorption. Thus, amlodipine directly inhibits \n\nvasoconstriction and reduces vascular resistance, while aliskiren, by controlling Ang II production, \n\ncan also inhibit vasoconstriction but additionally shifts water and sodium balance toward levels \n\nnecessary for normotensive conditions. The combined action of aliskiren and amlodipine on these two \n\ncentral blood pressure-regulating factors (vasoconstriction and RAAS-mediated hypertensive effects) \n\nresults in more effective antihypertensive effects than seen with monotherapy. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo was studied in a number of active and placebo-controlled trials and long-term trials which \n\nincluded a total of 5,570 hypertensive patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood \n\npressure between 90 mmHg and 109 mmHg). \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients not controlled by the component monotherapies, once-daily administration of \n\nRasilamlo provided dose-dependent clinically meaningful reductions in both systolic and diastolic \n\nblood pressure. \n\n \n\nWhen given to patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by either aliskiren or \n\namlodipine, Rasilamlo results in greater blood pressure reductions after one week of treatment than \n\nthe component monotherapies and a near-maximal effect is achieved after four weeks of therapy. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 820 randomised patients not adequately responsive to aliskiren 300 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine 300 mg/10 mg produced systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 18.0/13.1 mmHg, which were statistically significantly greater than aliskiren 300 mg \n\nmonotherapy. The combination at a dose of 300 mg/5 mg also showed statistically significantly \n\ngreater blood pressure reduction than aliskiren 300 mg monotherapy. In a subset of 584 patients, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine produced additional systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 7.9/4.8 mmHg and 11.7/7.7 mmHg for the 300/5 mg and 300/10 mg strengths \n\nrespectively compared to aliskiren 300 mg (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, \n\ndefined as difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nIn a study in 847 randomised patients not adequately responsive to amlodipine 10 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine 150 mg/10 mg and 300 mg/10 mg produced systolic/diastolic \n\nmean blood pressure reductions of 11.0/9.0 mmHg and 14.4/11.0 mmHg respectively, which were \n\nstatistically greater than for amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy. In a subset of 549 patients, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine produced additional systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 4.0/2.2 mmHg and 7.6/4.7 mmHg for the 150/10 mg and 300/10 mg strengths \n\nrespectively compared to amlodipine 10 mg (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, \n\ndefined as difference in SBP ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nIn a study in 545 randomised patients not adequately responsive to 5 mg amlodipine, the combination \n\nof aliskiren 150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg resulted in greater blood pressure reduction than those patients \n\nremaining on amlodipine 5 mg. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n16 \n\nIn an 8-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study in \n\n1,688 randomised patients with mild to moderate hypertension, treatment with Rasilamlo at doses \n\nfrom 150 mg/5 mg to 300 mg/10 mg produced dose-dependent clinically meaningful mean blood \n\npressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) ranging between 20.6/14.0 mmHg and 23.9/16.5 mmHg, \n\nrespectively, compared to 15.4/10.2 mmHg for aliskiren 300 mg, 21.0/13.8 mmHg for amlodipine \n\n10 mg and 6.8/5.4 mmHg with placebo in a population of patients with mean baseline blood pressure \n\nof 157.3/99.7 mmHg. These were statistically significant versus placebo and aliskiren for all doses. \n\nThe blood pressure reductions with the combination were maintained throughout the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. In a subset of 1,069 patients, Rasilamlo produced mean blood pressure reductions \n\n(systolic/diastolic) ranging between 20.6/13.6 mmHg and 24.2/17.3 mmHg (the subset of patients \n\nwithout aberrant readings, defined as difference in SBP ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nThe safety of Rasilamlo has been evaluated in studies of up to one year duration. \n\n \n\nThe effects of Rasilamlo on all cause and cardiovascular mortality and on cardiovascular morbidity \n\nand target organ damage are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo has been administered to more than 2,800 patients in completed clinical trials, including \n\n372 patients for one year or more. Treatment with Rasilamlo at doses up to 300 mg/10 mg had an \n\noverall incidence of adverse experiences similar to the component monotherapies. The incidence of \n\nadverse events did not show any association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. \n\nThere were no new adverse reactions which occurred specifically with Rasilamlo in addition to those \n\nknown to be associated with the individual monotherapies. In a double-blind, randomised placebo-\n\ncontrolled study in 1,688 patients with mild or moderate hypertension, discontinuation of therapy due \n\nto a clinical adverse event occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with Rasilamlo versus 1.5% of \n\npatients given placebo. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other medicinal products that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with \n\naliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions \n\nwere found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive medicinal products. The \n\nclinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were \n\nmaintained over the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a \n\nmean peak to trough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the \n\nmaximal blood-pressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering \n\neffect was sustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass \n\nindex and ethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in \n\n426 patients aged 75 years or older. \n\n \n\nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to other \n\nclasses of antihypertensive medicinal products including selected ACEI and ARB. Compared to a \n\ndiuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ), aliskiren 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n\n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide and \n\nthe beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well tolerated. Aliskiren induced an additive \n\nblood-pressure-lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction \n\nin blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood \n\npressure lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three \n\ndoses were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive medicinal products. With cessation of \n\ntreatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, \n\nwith no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nThe final study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.097 in favour of placebo \n\n(95.4% Confidence Interval: 0.987, 1.218, 2-sided p=0.0787). In addition, an increased incidence of \n\nadverse events was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (38.2% versus 30.3%). In particular \n\nthere was an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.5% versus 12.4%), hyperkalaemia (39.1% \n\nversus 29.0%), hypotension-related events (19.9% versus 16.3%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints \n\n(3.4% versus 2.7%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal \n\ninsufficiency. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n18 \n\nAliskiren 150 mg (increased to 300 mg if tolerated) added to conventional therapy was evaluated in a \n\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial in 1,639 patients with reduced ejection fraction \n\nhospitalised for an episode of acute heart failure (NYHA Class III–IV) who were haemodynamically \n\nstable at baseline. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death or heart failure rehospitalisation \n\nwithin 6 months; secondary endpoints were assessed within 12 months. \n\n \n\nThe study showed no benefit of aliskiren when administered on top of standard therapy for acute \n\nheart failure and an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Study \n\nresults indicated a non-significant effect of aliskiren with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% Confidence \n\nInterval: 0.76-1.12; p=0.41, aliskiren vs. placebo). Different treatment effects of aliskiren were \n\nreported for overall mortality within 12 months dependent on diabetes mellitus status. In the subgroup \n\nof patients with diabetes mellitus the hazard ratio was 1.64 in favour of placebo (95% Confidence \n\nInterval: 1.15-2.33), whereas the hazard ratio in the subgroup of patients without diabetes was 0.69 in \n\nfavour of aliskiren (95% Confidence Interval: 0.50-0.94); p-value for interaction = 0.0003. An \n\nincreased incidence of hyperkalaemia (20.9% versus 17.5%), renal impairment/renal failure (16.6% \n\nversus 12.1%) and hypotension (17.1% versus 12.6%) was observed in the aliskiren group compared \n\nwith placebo and was greater in patients with diabetes. \n\n \n\nEffects of aliskiren on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nNo long-term efficacy data for aliskiren in patients with heart failure are currently available. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Rasilamlo inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both \n\ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. \n\n \n\nThe contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the \n\nmovement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilatation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in \n\nblood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine \n\nlevels with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n19 \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, \n\nvasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with heart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% vs 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was \n\nno significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRasilamlo in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC \n\n0-tau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than \n\nwith the initial dose. \n\n \n\nTransporters \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption \n\nand biliary excretion of aliskiren in pre-clinical studies. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n20 \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as \n\nunchanged compound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. \n\nThe enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is \n\nrecovered in urine following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, mean plasma \n\nclearance is approximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to \n\n17 years given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules \n\n(3.125 mg/tablet), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The results of this \n\nstudy did not suggest that age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren \n\nsystemic exposure (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nResults from an in vitro MDR1 human tissue study suggested an age and tissue dependent pattern of \n\nMDR1 (P-gp) transporter maturation. A high inter-individual variability of mRNA expression levels \n\nwas observed (up to 600-fold). Hepatic MDR1 mRNA expression was statistically significantly lower \n\nin samples from foetuses, neonates and infants up to 23 months. \n\n \n\nThe age at which the transporter system is mature cannot be determined. There is a potential for \n\naliskiren overexposure in children with an immature MDR1 (P-gp) system (see “Transporters” above \n\nand sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated as between 64% \n\nand 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, with \n\n10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration \n\nfor 7-8 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 5 mg and 10 mg. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine \n\nFollowing oral administration of Rasilamlo, the median peak plasma concentration time is within \n\n3 hours for aliskiren and 8 hours for amlodipine. The rate and extent of absorption of Rasilamlo are \n\nsimilar in fasting state to those of aliskiren and amlodipine when administered as individual \n\nmonotherapies. A bioequivalence study under light meal conditions has not been conducted for \n\nRasilamlo. \n\n \n\nThe results from a food effect study using a standard high fat meal with the 300 mg/10 mg fixed \n\ncombination tablet showed that food reduced the rate and extent of absorption of aliskiren in the \n\nfixed combination tablet with a similar magnitude of effect as for aliskiren monotherapy. Consistent \n\nwith the monotherapy formulation, food had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine in the \n\nfixed combination tablet. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \n\nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dosage of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger \n\nsubjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and \n\nelimination half-life in elderly patients. Increases in AUC and elimination half-life in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure were as expected for the patient age group in this study (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in 74 hypertensive children aged from 1 to \n\n17 years (with 34 patients aged 6 to 12 years and 28 patients aged 13 to 17 years) receiving \n\namlodipine between 1.25 and 20 mg given either once or twice daily. In children 6 to 12 years and in \n\nadolescents 13-17 years of age the typical oral clearance (CL/F) was 22.5 and 27.4 l/hr respectively \n\nin males and 16.4 and 21.3 l/hr respectively in females. Large variability in exposure between \n\nindividuals was observed. Data reported in children below 6 years are limited. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n22 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. \n\n \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with \n\nresulting increase in AUC of approximately 40-60%. Therefore caution should be exercised in \n\npatients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nJuvenile Animal Studies \n\nA repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in juvenile rats 8 days post-partum for 4 weeks with \n\naliskiren dosing at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day. High acute mortality (within hours) and severe \n\nmorbidity were observed at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day (2.3- and 6.8-fold the maximum recommended \n\nhuman dose (MRHD) on mg/m2 basis assuming a 60 kg adult patient) with no cause of death \n\nestablished and occurring without signs or prodromal symptoms. The ratio of lethal dose of \n\n100 mg/kg/day and no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day is unexpectedly low. \n\n \n\nAnother repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in juvenile rats 14 days post-partum for 8 weeks \n\nwith aliskiren dosing at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day. Delayed mortality was observed at 300 mg/kg/day \n\n(8.5-fold the MRHD on mg/m2 basis assuming a 60 kg adult patient) with no cause of death \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nFor the surviving juvenile rats, no effects on behavioural or reproductive performance were observed. \n\n \n\nPlasma aliskiren exposure (AUC) in rats aged 8 days was nearly 4-fold higher than that in rats aged \n\n14 days at 100 mg/kg/day. Plasma aliskiren exposure in rats aged 14 days was between 85- and 387-\n\nfold higher than that in adult rats aged 64 days. \n\n \n\nA single dose study was conducted in juvenile rats aged 14, 21, 24, 28, 31 or 36 days post-partum. \n\nNo mortality or significant toxicity was observed. The plasma exposure was approximately 100-fold \n\nhigher in rats aged 14 days and 3-fold higher in rats aged 21 days compared to adult rats. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n23 \n\nA mechanistic study was conducted to investigate the relationship between age, aliskiren exposure \n\nand MDR1 and OATP2 expression maturation in rats. The results showed that developmental \n\nchanges of aliskiren exposure correlated with the ontogeny of transporter maturation in jejunum, liver, \n\nkidney and brain. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren was evaluated in rats aged from 8 to 28 days after intravenous \n\nadministration of aliskiren 3 mg/kg. The clearance of aliskiren increased in an age-dependent \n\nmanner. Clearance in rats aged 8 or 14 days was similar, but at these ages the clearance was only \n\nabout 23% of clearance in rats aged 21 days and 16% of clearance in rats aged 28 days. \n\n \n\nThese studies indicate that excessive aliskiren exposure (>400-fold higher in 8-day old rats compared \n\nwith adult rats) and high acute toxicity in juvenile rats are caused by immature MDR1, which \n\nsuggests that in paediatric patients with immature MDR1, there is a potential for aliskiren \n\noverexposure (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nSafety data for amlodipine are well established both clinically and non-clinically. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose \n\nof 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no effects related to the medicinal product at either the gene or \n\nchromosome levels. \n\n \n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nRasilamlo \n\nPreclinical safety studies have demonstrated that the combination of aliskiren and amlodipine was \n\nwell tolerated in rats. The findings from the 2- and 13-week oral toxicity studies in rats were \n\nconsistent with those of aliskiren and amlodipine when both active substances are administered alone. \n\nThere were no new toxicities or increased severity of the toxicities which were associated with either \n\ncomponent. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n24 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRasilamlo 150 mg/10 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate) and 10 mg amlodipine (as \n\nbesylate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nYellow, convex, ovaloid tablet with a bevelled edge, with “T7” debossed on one side and “NVR” on \n\nthe other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasilamlo is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adult patients whose blood \n\npressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine used alone. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasilamlo is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is manifested within 1 week and the effect is near maximal at around \n\n4 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy, the dose may be \n\ntitrated up to a maximum of 300 mg aliskiren/10 mg amlodipine. Dose should be individualised and \n\nadjusted according to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo may be administered with other antihypertensive medicinal products with the exception of \n\nuse in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPosology in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine monotherapy  \n\nRasilamlo 150 mg/10 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with amlodipine 10 mg alone or with Rasilamlo 150 mg/5 mg. \n\n \n\nA patient who experiences dose limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be \n\nswitched to Rasilamlo containing a lower dose of that component to achieve similar blood pressure \n\nreductions. \n\n \n\nIndividual dose titration with each of the two components may be recommended before changing to \n\nthe fixed combination. When clinically appropriate and in line with the above-mentioned posology, \n\ndirect change from monotherapy to the fixed combination may be considered. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n27 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(GFR 89-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively, see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nRasilamlo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nAmlodipine dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine have not been studied in severe hepatic \n\nimpairment; therefore, caution should be exercised when administering Rasilamlo to patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nElderly people (over 65 years) \n\nThere is limited experience with Rasilamlo, in particular in patients aged 75 years or older. \n\nTherefore, particular caution should be exercised in these patients. The recommended starting dose of \n\naliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful additional blood pressure reduction \n\nis observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasilamlo in children below age 18 have not been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in \n\nchildren aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasilamlo should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Concomitant intake with fruit juice \n\nand/or drinks containing plant extracts (including herbal teas) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or \nother dihydropyridine derivatives. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of Rasilamlo with an ACEI or an ARB is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections  4.5 and 5.1). \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n Children from birth to less than 2 years (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n28 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasilamlo therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients \n\nwith ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial \n\ninfarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and decreased renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that  \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the RAAS by combining aliskiren with an ACEI \n\nor an ARB is therefore not recommended. If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely \n\nnecessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring \n\nof renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nNo data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are available for aliskiren in patients with heart \n\nfailure (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasilamloin the following \n\ncases: \n\n Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasilamlo, or the \n\ntreatment should start under close medical supervision. In patients with uncomplicated hypertension \n\ntreated with Rasilamlo in short-term controlled trials, the incidence of hypotension was low (0.2%). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn clinical studies aliskiren has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (serum creatinine ≥150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and ≥177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \n\nmen and/or estimated GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or \n\nrenovascular hypertension. Rasilamlo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, caution should be \n\nexercised when Rasilamlo is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction \n\nsuch as hypovolaemia (e.g. due to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, \n\netc.), heart disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible \n\nupon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-\n\nmarketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be promptly \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n29 \n\nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and \n\nthese may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic \n\ndetermination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe half life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \n\nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. Caution should be exercised when \n\nadministering Rasilamlo to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \n\nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasilamlo in patients with unilateral or \n\nbilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal \n\nproducts acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal \n\ninsufficiency, including acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with \n\naliskiren. Therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment \n\nshould be discontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, \n\nthroat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal products that can cause angioedema, including \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasilamlo should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n30 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAliskiren is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and there is a potential for aliskiren overexposure in \n\nchildren with an immature P-gp drug transporter system. The age at which the transporter system is \n\nmature cannot be determined (see sections 5.2 and 5.3). Therefore, Rasilamlo is contraindicated in \n\nchildren from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years. \n\n \n\nLimited safety data are available from a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 \n\nhypertensive children aged 6 to less than 18 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasilamlo interactions \n\nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Rasilamlo. Therefore, \n\ninformation on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual active \n\nsubstances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren and amlodipine does not cause meaningful changes in the steady-state \n\npharmacokinetic exposure (AUC) and the maximum concentration (Cmax) of either component in \n\nhealthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nInformation on aliskiren interactions \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n- P-gp potent inhibitors \nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The \n\nincrease may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) \n\nincreases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, \n\nconcomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n- Fruit juice and drinks containing plant extracts \nAdministration of fruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. Co-\n\nadministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC \n\nand co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. Co-\n\nadministration of orange or apple juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 62% decrease in aliskiren \n\nAUC or in a 63% decrease in aliskiren AUC, respectively. This decrease is likely due to an \n\ninhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by components of \n\nfruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, fruit juice \n\nshould not be taken together with Rasilamlo. The effect of drinks containing plant extracts (including \n\nherbal teas) on the absorption of aliskiren has not been investigated. However, compounds potentially \n\ninhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren are widely present in \n\nfruits, vegetables, and many other plant products. Therefore, drinks containing plant extracts, \n\nincluding herbal teas, should not be taken together with Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the RAAS with aliskiren, ARBs or ACEIs \n\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACEIs, \n\nARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, stroke, \n\nhyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a \n\nsingle RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n31 \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- P-gp interactions \nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption \n\nand biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies (see section 5.2). Rifampicin, which is an \n\ninducer of P-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other \n\ninducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has \n\nnot been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of \n\nsubstrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp \n\ninhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at \n\nthe P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\n- Moderate P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved \n\nif the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. \n\n \n\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, NSAIDs may \n\nreduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function \n\n(dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in \n\nfurther deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually \n\nreversible. Therefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\n- Furosemide and torasemide \nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day.  \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see interaction with organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n- Warfarin \nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\n- Food interactions \nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). The available clinical data do not suggest an additive effect of different types of \nfoods and/or drinks, however the potential for decreased aliskiren bioavailability due to this additive \n\neffect has not been studied and therefore cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of aliskiren \n\nwith fruit juice or drinks containing plant extracts, including herbal teas, should be avoided. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of aliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with fruit juice). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n33 \n\nInformation on amlodipine interactions \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on amlodipine \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibitors \nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, \n\nazole antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give \n\nrise to significant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers \nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\n- Grapefruit juice \nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\n- Dantrolene (infusion) \nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nEffects of amlodipine on other medicinal products \n\n- The blood pressure lowering effects of amlodipine adds to the blood pressure-lowering effects \nof other antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in \na 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to \n\nlimit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, \ndigoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\nHealthcare professionals prescribing Rasilamlo should counsel women of childbearing potential about \n\nthe potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment \n\nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasilamlo should not be used in \n\nwomen planning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, \n\naliskiren should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy and is contraindicated during the \n\nsecond and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n34 \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. Reproductive studies in rats \n\nhave shown no toxicity except for delayed date of delivery and prolonged duration of labour at \n\ndosages 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans (see section 5.3). Use \n\nin pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself \n\ncarries greater risk for the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasilamlo is contraindicated \n\nduring the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasilamlo should be discontinued accordingly as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was \n\nsecreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n\n \n\nSince there is insufficient/limited information on the excretion of aliskiren and amlodipine in human \n\nor animal breast milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It is therefore not \n\nrecommended for women who are breast-feeding to use Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \n\nRasilamlo therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \n\ntherapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility with the use of Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\nThe fertility of rats was unaffected at doses of up to aliskiren 250 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nWhen driving vehicles or using machines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may \n\noccasionally occur when taking Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If \n\npatients taking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea, the ability to react may \n\nbe impaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety profile of Rasilamlo presented below is based on clinical studies performed with \n\nRasilamlo and the known safety profile of the individual components aliskiren and amlodipine. \n\nSafety information for Rasilamlo in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions for Rasilamlo are hypotension and peripheral oedema. The \n\nadverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components of Rasilamlo (aliskiren \n\nand amlodipine) and included in the tabulated list of adverse reactions may occur with Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n35 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \n\nconvention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare  \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata).

A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \n\nuncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in hypertensive \n\npatients, aliskiren had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \n\ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other medicinal products acting on \n\nthe RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nBased on the limited amount of safety data available from a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren \n\ntreatment in 39 hypertensive children 6-17 years of age, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \n\nreactions in children are expected to be similar to that seen in hypertensive adults. As for other RAAS \n\nblockers, headache is a common adverse event in children treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nExceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n38 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Rasilamlo. The most likely manifestation of overdose for \n\nRasilamlo would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren and amlodipine. \n\n \n\nWith aliskiren, the most likely manifestation of overdose would be hypotension, related to the \n\nantihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nWith amlodipine, available data suggest that gross overdose could result in excessive peripheral \n\nvasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension \n\nup to and including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur with Rasilamlo, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \n\n \n\nA vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is \n\nno contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the \n\neffects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to \n\n2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of \n\namlodipine. \n\n \n\nSince amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (<2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, renin inhibitors, ATC \n\ncode: C09XA53 \n\n \n\nRasilamlo combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control \n\nblood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: aliskiren belongs to the class of direct renin \n\ninhibitors and amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n39 \n\nRasilamlo \n\nThe use of combined treatment with aliskiren and amlodipine arises from the actions of these two \n\nmedicinal products on different but complementary systems that regulate blood pressure. Calcium \n\nchannel blockers act to prevent the influx of calcium into the vascular smooth muscle cells in the \n\nvessel wall, thereby preventing smooth muscle cell contraction and vasoconstriction. Renin inhibitors \n\nsuppress the enzymatic activity of renin, and thereby block the formation of Angiotensin II, the major \n\neffector molecule of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Angiotensin II causes \n\nvasoconstriction and sodium and water reabsorption. Thus, amlodipine directly inhibits \n\nvasoconstriction and reduces vascular resistance, while aliskiren, by controlling Ang II production, \n\ncan also inhibit vasoconstriction but additionally shifts water and sodium balance toward levels \n\nnecessary for normotensive conditions. The combined action of aliskiren and amlodipine on these two \n\ncentral blood pressure-regulating factors (vasoconstriction and RAAS-mediated hypertensive effects) \n\nresults in more effective antihypertensive effects than seen with monotherapy. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo was studied in a number of active and placebo-controlled trials and long-term trials which \n\nincluded a total of 5,570 hypertensive patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood \n\npressure between 90 mmHg and 109 mmHg). \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients not controlled by the component monotherapies, once-daily administration of \n\nRasilamlo provided dose-dependent clinically meaningful reductions in both systolic and diastolic \n\nblood pressure. \n\n \n\nWhen given to patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by either aliskiren or \n\namlodipine, Rasilamlo results in greater blood pressure reductions after one week of treatment than \n\nthe component monotherapies and a near-maximal effect is achieved after four weeks of therapy. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 820 randomised patients not adequately responsive to aliskiren 300 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine 300 mg/10 mg produced systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 18.0/13.1 mmHg, which were statistically significantly greater than aliskiren 300 mg \n\nmonotherapy. The combination at a dose of 300 mg/5 mg also showed statistically significantly \n\ngreater blood pressure reduction than aliskiren 300 mg monotherapy. In a subset of 584 patients, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine produced additional systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 7.9/4.8 mmHg and 11.7/7.7 mmHg for the 300/5 mg and 300/10 mg strengths \n\nrespectively compared to aliskiren 300 mg (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, \n\ndefined as difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nIn a study in 847 randomised patients not adequately responsive to amlodipine 10 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine 150 mg/10 mg and 300 mg/10 mg produced systolic/diastolic \n\nmean blood pressure reductions of 11.0/9.0 mmHg and 14.4/11.0 mmHg respectively, which were \n\nstatistically greater than for amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy. In a subset of 549 patients, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine produced additional systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 4.0/2.2 mmHg and 7.6/4.7 mmHg for the 150/10 mg and 300/10 mg strengths \n\nrespectively compared to amlodipine 10 mg (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, \n\ndefined as difference in SBP ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nIn a study in 545 randomised patients not adequately responsive to 5 mg amlodipine, the combination \n\nof aliskiren 150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg resulted in greater blood pressure reduction than those patients \n\nremaining on amlodipine 5 mg. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n40 \n\nIn an 8-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study in \n\n1,688 randomised patients with mild to moderate hypertension, treatment with Rasilamlo at doses \n\nfrom 150 mg/5 mg to 300 mg/10 mg produced dose-dependent clinically meaningful mean blood \n\npressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) ranging between 20.6/14.0 mmHg and 23.9/16.5 mmHg, \n\nrespectively, compared to 15.4/10.2 mmHg for aliskiren 300 mg, 21.0/13.8 mmHg for amlodipine \n\n10 mg and 6.8/5.4 mmHg with placebo in a population of patients with mean baseline blood pressure \n\nof 157.3/99.7 mmHg. These were statistically significant versus placebo and aliskiren for all doses. \n\nThe blood pressure reductions with the combination were maintained throughout the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. In a subset of 1,069 patients, Rasilamlo produced mean blood pressure reductions \n\n(systolic/diastolic) ranging between 20.6/13.6 mmHg and 24.2/17.3 mmHg (the subset of patients \n\nwithout aberrant readings, defined as difference in SBP ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nThe safety of Rasilamlo has been evaluated in studies of up to one year duration. \n\n \n\nThe effects of Rasilamlo on all cause and cardiovascular mortality and on cardiovascular morbidity \n\nand target organ damage are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo has been administered to more than 2,800 patients in completed clinical trials, including \n\n372 patients for one year or more. Treatment with Rasilamlo at doses up to 300 mg/10 mg had an \n\noverall incidence of adverse experiences similar to the component monotherapies. The incidence of \n\nadverse events did not show any association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. \n\nThere were no new adverse reactions which occurred specifically with Rasilamlo in addition to those \n\nknown to be associated with the individual monotherapies. In a double-blind, randomised placebo-\n\ncontrolled study in 1,688 patients with mild or moderate hypertension, discontinuation of therapy due \n\nto a clinical adverse event occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with Rasilamlo versus 1.5% of \n\npatients given placebo. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other medicinal products that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with \n\naliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions \n\nwere found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive medicinal products. The \n\nclinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were \n\nmaintained over the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a \n\nmean peak to trough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the \n\nmaximal blood-pressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering \n\neffect was sustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass \n\nindex and ethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in \n\n426 patients aged 75 years or older. \n\n \n\nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to other \n\nclasses of antihypertensive medicinal products including selected ACEI and ARB. Compared to a \n\ndiuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ), aliskiren 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n\n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide and \n\nthe beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well tolerated. Aliskiren induced an additive \n\nblood-pressure-lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction \n\nin blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood \n\npressure lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three \n\ndoses were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive medicinal products. With cessation of \n\ntreatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, \n\nwith no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nThe final study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.097 in favour of placebo \n\n(95.4% Confidence Interval: 0.987, 1.218, 2-sided p=0.0787). In addition, an increased incidence of \n\nadverse events was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (38.2% versus 30.3%). In particular \n\nthere was an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.5% versus 12.4%), hyperkalaemia (39.1% \n\nversus 29.0%), hypotension-related events (19.9% versus 16.3%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints \n\n(3.4% versus 2.7%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal \n\ninsufficiency. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n42 \n\nAliskiren 150 mg (increased to 300 mg if tolerated) added to conventional therapy was evaluated in a \n\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial in 1,639 patients with reduced ejection fraction \n\nhospitalised for an episode of acute heart failure (NYHA Class III–IV) who were haemodynamically \n\nstable at baseline. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death or heart failure rehospitalisation \n\nwithin 6 months; secondary endpoints were assessed within 12 months. \n\n \n\nThe study showed no benefit of aliskiren when administered on top of standard therapy for acute \n\nheart failure and an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Study \n\nresults indicated a non-significant effect of aliskiren with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% Confidence \n\nInterval: 0.76-1.12; p=0.41, aliskiren vs. placebo). Different treatment effects of aliskiren were \n\nreported for overall mortality within 12 months dependent on diabetes mellitus status. In the subgroup \n\nof patients with diabetes mellitus the hazard ratio was 1.64 in favour of placebo (95% Confidence \n\nInterval: 1.15-2.33), whereas the hazard ratio in the subgroup of patients without diabetes was 0.69 in \n\nfavour of aliskiren (95% Confidence Interval: 0.50-0.94); p-value for interaction = 0.0003. An \n\nincreased incidence of hyperkalaemia (20.9% versus 17.5%), renal impairment/renal failure (16.6% \n\nversus 12.1%) and hypotension (17.1% versus 12.6%) was observed in the aliskiren group compared \n\nwith placebo and was greater in patients with diabetes. \n\n \n\nEffects of aliskiren on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nNo long-term efficacy data for aliskiren in patients with heart failure are currently available. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Rasilamlo inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both \n\ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. \n\n \n\nThe contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the \n\nmovement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilatation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in \n\nblood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine \n\nlevels with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n43 \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, \n\nvasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with heart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% vs 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was \n\nno significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRasilamlo in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC \n\n0-tau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than \n\nwith the initial dose. \n\n \n\nTransporters \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption \n\nand biliary excretion of aliskiren in pre-clinical studies. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n44 \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as \n\nunchanged compound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. \n\nThe enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is \n\nrecovered in urine following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, mean plasma \n\nclearance is approximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to \n\n17 years given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules \n\n(3.125 mg/tablet), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The results of this \n\nstudy did not suggest that age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren \n\nsystemic exposure (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nResults from an in vitro MDR1 human tissue study suggested an age and tissue dependent pattern of \n\nMDR1 (P-gp) transporter maturation. A high inter-individual variability of mRNA expression levels \n\nwas observed (up to 600-fold). Hepatic MDR1 mRNA expression was statistically significantly lower \n\nin samples from foetuses, neonates and infants up to 23 months. \n\n \n\nThe age at which the transporter system is mature cannot be determined. There is a potential for \n\naliskiren overexposure in children with an immature MDR1 (P-gp) system (see “Transporters” above \n\nand sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated as between 64% \n\nand 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, with \n\n10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration \n\nfor 7-8 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 5 mg and 10 mg. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine \n\nFollowing oral administration of Rasilamlo, the median peak plasma concentration time is within \n\n3 hours for aliskiren and 8 hours for amlodipine. The rate and extent of absorption of Rasilamlo are \n\nsimilar in fasting state to those of aliskiren and amlodipine when administered as individual \n\nmonotherapies. A bioequivalence study under light meal conditions has not been conducted for \n\nRasilamlo. \n\n \n\nThe results from a food effect study using a standard high fat meal with the 300 mg/10 mg fixed \n\ncombination tablet showed that food reduced the rate and extent of absorption of aliskiren in the \n\nfixed combination tablet with a similar magnitude of effect as for aliskiren monotherapy. Consistent \n\nwith the monotherapy formulation, food had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine in the \n\nfixed combination tablet. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \n\nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dosage of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger \n\nsubjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and \n\nelimination half-life in elderly patients. Increases in AUC and elimination half-life in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure were as expected for the patient age group in this study (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in 74 hypertensive children aged from 1 to \n\n17 years (with 34 patients aged 6 to 12 years and 28 patients aged 13 to 17 years) receiving \n\namlodipine between 1.25 and 20 mg given either once or twice daily. In children 6 to 12 years and in \n\nadolescents 13-17 years of age the typical oral clearance (CL/F) was 22.5 and 27.4 l/hr respectively \n\nin males and 16.4 and 21.3 l/hr respectively in females. Large variability in exposure between \n\nindividuals was observed. Data reported in children below 6 years are limited. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n46 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. \n\n \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with \n\nresulting increase in AUC of approximately 40-60%. Therefore caution should be exercised in \n\npatients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nJuvenile Animal Studies \n\nA repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in juvenile rats 8 days post-partum for 4 weeks with \n\naliskiren dosing at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day. High acute mortality (within hours) and severe \n\nmorbidity were observed at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day (2.3- and 6.8-fold the maximum recommended \n\nhuman dose (MRHD) on mg/m2 basis assuming a 60 kg adult patient) with no cause of death \n\nestablished and occurring without signs or prodromal symptoms. The ratio of lethal dose of \n\n100 mg/kg/day and no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day is unexpectedly low. \n\n \n\nAnother repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in juvenile rats 14 days post-partum for 8 weeks \n\nwith aliskiren dosing at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day. Delayed mortality was observed at 300 mg/kg/day \n\n(8.5-fold the MRHD on mg/m2 basis assuming a 60 kg adult patient) with no cause of death \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nFor the surviving juvenile rats, no effects on behavioural or reproductive performance were observed. \n\n \n\nPlasma aliskiren exposure (AUC) in rats aged 8 days was nearly 4-fold higher than that in rats aged \n\n14 days at 100 mg/kg/day. Plasma aliskiren exposure in rats aged 14 days was between 85- and 387-\n\nfold higher than that in adult rats aged 64 days. \n\n \n\nA single dose study was conducted in juvenile rats aged 14, 21, 24, 28, 31 or 36 days post-partum. \n\nNo mortality or significant toxicity was observed. The plasma exposure was approximately 100-fold \n\nhigher in rats aged 14 days and 3-fold higher in rats aged 21 days compared to adult rats. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n47 \n\nA mechanistic study was conducted to investigate the relationship between age, aliskiren exposure \n\nand MDR1 and OATP2 expression maturation in rats. The results showed that developmental \n\nchanges of aliskiren exposure correlated with the ontogeny of transporter maturation in jejunum, liver, \n\nkidney and brain. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren was evaluated in rats aged from 8 to 28 days after intravenous \n\nadministration of aliskiren 3 mg/kg. The clearance of aliskiren increased in an age-dependent \n\nmanner. Clearance in rats aged 8 or 14 days was similar, but at these ages the clearance was only \n\nabout 23% of clearance in rats aged 21 days and 16% of clearance in rats aged 28 days. \n\n \n\nThese studies indicate that excessive aliskiren exposure (>400-fold higher in 8-day old rats compared \n\nwith adult rats) and high acute toxicity in juvenile rats are caused by immature MDR1, which \n\nsuggests that in paediatric patients with immature MDR1, there is a potential for aliskiren \n\noverexposure (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nSafety data for amlodipine are well established both clinically and non-clinically. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose \n\nof 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no effects related to the medicinal product at either the gene or \n\nchromosome levels. \n\n \n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nRasilamlo \n\nPreclinical safety studies have demonstrated that the combination of aliskiren and amlodipine was \n\nwell tolerated in rats. The findings from the 2- and 13-week oral toxicity studies in rats were \n\nconsistent with those of aliskiren and amlodipine when both active substances are administered alone. \n\nThere were no new toxicities or increased severity of the toxicities which were associated with either \n\ncomponent. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n48 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRasilamlo 300 mg/5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate) and 5 mg amlodipine (as \n\nbesylate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nDark yellow, convex, ovaloid tablet with a bevelled edge, with “T11” debossed on one side and \n\n“NVR” on the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasilamlo is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adult patients whose blood \n\npressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine used alone. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasilamlo is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is manifested within 1 week and the effect is near maximal at around \n\n4 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy, the dose may be \n\ntitrated up to a maximum of 300 mg aliskiren/10 mg amlodipine. Dose should be individualised and \n\nadjusted according to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo may be administered with other antihypertensive medicinal products with the exception of \n\nuse in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPosology in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine monotherapy  \n\nRasilamlo 300 mg/5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with aliskiren 300 mg alone or with Rasilamlo 150 mg/5 mg. \n\n \n\nA patient who experiences dose limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be \n\nswitched to Rasilamlo containing a lower dose of that component to achieve similar blood pressure \n\nreductions. \n\n \n\nIndividual dose titration with each of the two components may be recommended before changing to \n\nthe fixed combination. When clinically appropriate and in line with the above-mentioned posology, \n\ndirect change from monotherapy to the fixed combination may be considered. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n51 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(GFR 89-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively, see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nRasilamlo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nAmlodipine dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine have not been studied in severe hepatic \n\nimpairment; therefore, caution should be exercised when administering Rasilamlo to patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nElderly people (over 65 years) \n\nThere is limited experience with Rasilamlo, in particular in patients aged 75 years or older. \n\nTherefore, particular caution should be exercised in these patients. The recommended starting dose of \n\naliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful additional blood pressure reduction \n\nis observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasilamlo in children below age 18 have not been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in \n\nchildren aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasilamlo should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Concomitant intake with fruit juice \n\nand/or drinks containing plant extracts (including herbal teas) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or \nother dihydropyridine derivatives. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of Rasilamlo with an ACEI or an ARB is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections  4.5 and 5.1). \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n Children from birth to less than 2 years (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n52 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasilamlo therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients \n\nwith ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial \n\ninfarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and decreased renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that  \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the RAAS by combining aliskiren with an ACEI \n\nor an ARB is therefore not recommended. If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely \n\nnecessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring \n\nof renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nNo data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are available for aliskiren in patients with heart \n\nfailure (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasilamloin the following \n\ncases: \n\n Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to the administration of Rasilamlo, or the \n\ntreatment should start under close medical supervision. In patients with uncomplicated hypertension \n\ntreated with Rasilamlo in short-term controlled trials, the incidence of hypotension was low (0.2%). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn clinical studies aliskiren has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (serum creatinine ≥150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and ≥177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \n\nmen and/or estimated GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or \n\nrenovascular hypertension. Rasilamlo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, caution should be \n\nexercised when Rasilamlo is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction \n\nsuch as hypovolaemia (e.g. due to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, \n\netc.), heart disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible \n\nupon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-\n\nmarketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be promptly \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n53 \n\nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and \n\nthese may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic \n\ndetermination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe half life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \n\nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. Caution should be exercised when \n\nadministering Rasilamlo to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \n\nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasilamlo in patients with unilateral or \n\nbilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal \n\nproducts acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal \n\ninsufficiency, including acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with \n\naliskiren. Therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment \n\nshould be discontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, \n\nthroat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal products that can cause angioedema, including \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasilamlo should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n54 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAliskiren is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and there is a potential for aliskiren overexposure in \n\nchildren with an immature P-gp drug transporter system. The age at which the transporter system is \n\nmature cannot be determined (see sections 5.2 and 5.3). Therefore, Rasilamlo is contraindicated in \n\nchildren from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years. \n\n \n\nLimited safety data are available from a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 \n\nhypertensive children aged 6 to less than 18 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasilamlo interactions \n\nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Rasilamlo. Therefore, \n\ninformation on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual active \n\nsubstances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren and amlodipine does not cause meaningful changes in the steady-state \n\npharmacokinetic exposure (AUC) and the maximum concentration (Cmax) of either component in \n\nhealthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nInformation on aliskiren interactions \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n- P-gp potent inhibitors \nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The \n\nincrease may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) \n\nincreases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, \n\nconcomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n- Fruit juice and drinks containing plant extracts \nAdministration of fruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. Co-\n\nadministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC \n\nand co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. Co-\n\nadministration of orange or apple juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 62% decrease in aliskiren \n\nAUC or in a 63% decrease in aliskiren AUC, respectively. This decrease is likely due to an \n\ninhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by components of \n\nfruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, fruit juice \n\nshould not be taken together with Rasilamlo. The effect of drinks containing plant extracts (including \n\nherbal teas) on the absorption of aliskiren has not been investigated. However, compounds potentially \n\ninhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren are widely present in \n\nfruits, vegetables, and many other plant products. Therefore, drinks containing plant extracts, \n\nincluding herbal teas, should not be taken together with Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the RAAS with aliskiren, ARBs or ACEIs \n\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACEIs, \n\nARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, stroke, \n\nhyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a \n\nsingle RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n55 \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- P-gp interactions \nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption \n\nand biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies (see section 5.2). Rifampicin, which is an \n\ninducer of P-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other \n\ninducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has \n\nnot been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of \n\nsubstrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp \n\ninhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at \n\nthe P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\n- Moderate P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved \n\nif the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. \n\n \n\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, NSAIDs may \n\nreduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function \n\n(dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in \n\nfurther deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually \n\nreversible. Therefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\n- Furosemide and torasemide \nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see interaction with organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n- Warfarin \nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\n- Food interactions \nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). The available clinical data do not suggest an additive effect of different types of \nfoods and/or drinks, however the potential for decreased aliskiren bioavailability due to this additive \n\neffect has not been studied and therefore cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of aliskiren \n\nwith fruit juice or drinks containing plant extracts, including herbal teas, should be avoided. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of aliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with fruit juice). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n57 \n\nInformation on amlodipine interactions \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on amlodipine \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibitors \nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, \n\nazole antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give \n\nrise to significant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers \nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\n- Grapefruit juice \nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\n- Dantrolene (infusion) \nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nEffects of amlodipine on other medicinal products \n\n- The blood pressure lowering effects of amlodipine adds to the blood pressure-lowering effects \nof other antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in \na 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to \n\nlimit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, \ndigoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\nHealthcare professionals prescribing Rasilamlo should counsel women of childbearing potential about \n\nthe potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment \n\nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasilamlo should not be used in \n\nwomen planning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, \n\naliskiren should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy and is contraindicated during the \n\nsecond and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n58 \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. Reproductive studies in rats \n\nhave shown no toxicity except for delayed date of delivery and prolonged duration of labour at \n\ndosages 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans (see section 5.3). Use \n\nin pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself \n\ncarries greater risk for the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasilamlo is contraindicated \n\nduring the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasilamlo should be discontinued accordingly as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was \n\nsecreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n\n \n\nSince there is insufficient/limited information on the excretion of aliskiren and amlodipine in human \n\nor animal breast milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It is therefore not \n\nrecommended for women who are breast-feeding to use Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \n\nRasilamlo therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \n\ntherapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility with the use of Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\nThe fertility of rats was unaffected at doses of up to aliskiren 250 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nWhen driving vehicles or using machines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may \n\noccasionally occur when taking Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If \n\npatients taking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea, the ability to react may \n\nbe impaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety profile of Rasilamlo presented below is based on clinical studies performed with \n\nRasilamlo and the known safety profile of the individual components aliskiren and amlodipine. \n\nSafety information for Rasilamlo in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions for Rasilamlo are hypotension and peripheral oedema. The \n\nadverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components of Rasilamlo (aliskiren \n\nand amlodipine) and included in the tabulated list of adverse reactions may occur with Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n59 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \n\nconvention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare  \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata).

A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \n\nuncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in hypertensive \n\npatients, aliskiren had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \n\ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other medicinal products acting on \n\nthe RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nBased on the limited amount of safety data available from a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren \n\ntreatment in 39 hypertensive children 6-17 years of age, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \n\nreactions in children are expected to be similar to that seen in hypertensive adults. As for other RAAS \n\nblockers, headache is a common adverse event in children treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nExceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n62 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Rasilamlo. The most likely manifestation of overdose for \n\nRasilamlo would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren and amlodipine. \n\n \n\nWith aliskiren, the most likely manifestation of overdose would be hypotension, related to the \n\nantihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nWith amlodipine, available data suggest that gross overdose could result in excessive peripheral \n\nvasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension \n\nup to and including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur with Rasilamlo, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \n\n \n\nA vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is \n\nno contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the \n\neffects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to \n\n2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of \n\namlodipine. \n\n \n\nSince amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (<2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, renin inhibitors, ATC \n\ncode: C09XA53 \n\n \n\nRasilamlo combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control \n\nblood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: aliskiren belongs to the class of direct renin \n\ninhibitors and amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n63 \n\nRasilamlo \n\nThe use of combined treatment with aliskiren and amlodipine arises from the actions of these two \n\nmedicinal products on different but complementary systems that regulate blood pressure. Calcium \n\nchannel blockers act to prevent the influx of calcium into the vascular smooth muscle cells in the \n\nvessel wall, thereby preventing smooth muscle cell contraction and vasoconstriction. Renin inhibitors \n\nsuppress the enzymatic activity of renin, and thereby block the formation of Angiotensin II, the major \n\neffector molecule of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Angiotensin II causes \n\nvasoconstriction and sodium and water reabsorption. Thus, amlodipine directly inhibits \n\nvasoconstriction and reduces vascular resistance, while aliskiren, by controlling Ang II production, \n\ncan also inhibit vasoconstriction but additionally shifts water and sodium balance toward levels \n\nnecessary for normotensive conditions. The combined action of aliskiren and amlodipine on these two \n\ncentral blood pressure-regulating factors (vasoconstriction and RAAS-mediated hypertensive effects) \n\nresults in more effective antihypertensive effects than seen with monotherapy. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo was studied in a number of active and placebo-controlled trials and long-term trials which \n\nincluded a total of 5,570 hypertensive patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood \n\npressure between 90 mmHg and 109 mmHg). \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients not controlled by the component monotherapies, once-daily administration of \n\nRasilamlo provided dose-dependent clinically meaningful reductions in both systolic and diastolic \n\nblood pressure. \n\n \n\nWhen given to patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by either aliskiren or \n\namlodipine, Rasilamlo results in greater blood pressure reductions after one week of treatment than \n\nthe component monotherapies and a near-maximal effect is achieved after four weeks of therapy. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 820 randomised patients not adequately responsive to aliskiren 300 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine 300 mg/10 mg produced systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 18.0/13.1 mmHg, which were statistically significantly greater than aliskiren 300 mg \n\nmonotherapy. The combination at a dose of 300 mg/5 mg also showed statistically significantly \n\ngreater blood pressure reduction than aliskiren 300 mg monotherapy. In a subset of 584 patients, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine produced additional systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 7.9/4.8 mmHg and 11.7/7.7 mmHg for the 300/5 mg and 300/10 mg strengths \n\nrespectively compared to aliskiren 300 mg (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, \n\ndefined as difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nIn a study in 847 randomised patients not adequately responsive to amlodipine 10 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine 150 mg/10 mg and 300 mg/10 mg produced systolic/diastolic \n\nmean blood pressure reductions of 11.0/9.0 mmHg and 14.4/11.0 mmHg respectively, which were \n\nstatistically greater than for amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy. In a subset of 549 patients, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine produced additional systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 4.0/2.2 mmHg and 7.6/4.7 mmHg for the 150/10 mg and 300/10 mg strengths \n\nrespectively compared to amlodipine 10 mg (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, \n\ndefined as difference in SBP ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nIn a study in 545 randomised patients not adequately responsive to 5 mg amlodipine, the combination \n\nof aliskiren 150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg resulted in greater blood pressure reduction than those patients \n\nremaining on amlodipine 5 mg. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n64 \n\nIn an 8-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study in \n\n1,688 randomised patients with mild to moderate hypertension, treatment with Rasilamlo at doses \n\nfrom 150 mg/5 mg to 300 mg/10 mg produced dose-dependent clinically meaningful mean blood \n\npressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) ranging between 20.6/14.0 mmHg and 23.9/16.5 mmHg, \n\nrespectively, compared to 15.4/10.2 mmHg for aliskiren 300 mg, 21.0/13.8 mmHg for amlodipine \n\n10 mg and 6.8/5.4 mmHg with placebo in a population of patients with mean baseline blood pressure \n\nof 157.3/99.7 mmHg. These were statistically significant versus placebo and aliskiren for all doses. \n\nThe blood pressure reductions with the combination were maintained throughout the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. In a subset of 1,069 patients, Rasilamlo produced mean blood pressure reductions \n\n(systolic/diastolic) ranging between 20.6/13.6 mmHg and 24.2/17.3 mmHg (the subset of patients \n\nwithout aberrant readings, defined as difference in SBP ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nThe safety of Rasilamlo has been evaluated in studies of up to one year duration. \n\n \n\nThe effects of Rasilamlo on all cause and cardiovascular mortality and on cardiovascular morbidity \n\nand target organ damage are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo has been administered to more than 2,800 patients in completed clinical trials, including \n\n372 patients for one year or more. Treatment with Rasilamlo at doses up to 300 mg/10 mg had an \n\noverall incidence of adverse experiences similar to the component monotherapies. The incidence of \n\nadverse events did not show any association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. \n\nThere were no new adverse reactions which occurred specifically with Rasilamlo in addition to those \n\nknown to be associated with the individual monotherapies. In a double-blind, randomised placebo-\n\ncontrolled study in 1,688 patients with mild or moderate hypertension, discontinuation of therapy due \n\nto a clinical adverse event occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with Rasilamlo versus 1.5% of \n\npatients given placebo. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other medicinal products that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with \n\naliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions \n\nwere found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive medicinal products. The \n\nclinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were \n\nmaintained over the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a \n\nmean peak to trough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the \n\nmaximal blood-pressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering \n\neffect was sustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass \n\nindex and ethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in \n\n426 patients aged 75 years or older. \n\n \n\nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to other \n\nclasses of antihypertensive medicinal products including selected ACEI and ARB. Compared to a \n\ndiuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ), aliskiren 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n\n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide and \n\nthe beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well tolerated. Aliskiren induced an additive \n\nblood-pressure-lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction \n\nin blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood \n\npressure lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three \n\ndoses were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive medicinal products. With cessation of \n\ntreatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, \n\nwith no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nThe final study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.097 in favour of placebo \n\n(95.4% Confidence Interval: 0.987, 1.218, 2-sided p=0.0787). In addition, an increased incidence of \n\nadverse events was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (38.2% versus 30.3%). In particular \n\nthere was an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.5% versus 12.4%), hyperkalaemia (39.1% \n\nversus 29.0%), hypotension-related events (19.9% versus 16.3%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints \n\n(3.4% versus 2.7%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal \n\ninsufficiency. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n66 \n\nAliskiren 150 mg (increased to 300 mg if tolerated) added to conventional therapy was evaluated in a \n\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial in 1,639 patients with reduced ejection fraction \n\nhospitalised for an episode of acute heart failure (NYHA Class III–IV) who were haemodynamically \n\nstable at baseline. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death or heart failure rehospitalisation \n\nwithin 6 months; secondary endpoints were assessed within 12 months. \n\n \n\nThe study showed no benefit of aliskiren when administered on top of standard therapy for acute \n\nheart failure and an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Study \n\nresults indicated a non-significant effect of aliskiren with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% Confidence \n\nInterval: 0.76-1.12; p=0.41, aliskiren vs. placebo). Different treatment effects of aliskiren were \n\nreported for overall mortality within 12 months dependent on diabetes mellitus status. In the subgroup \n\nof patients with diabetes mellitus the hazard ratio was 1.64 in favour of placebo (95% Confidence \n\nInterval: 1.15-2.33), whereas the hazard ratio in the subgroup of patients without diabetes was 0.69 in \n\nfavour of aliskiren (95% Confidence Interval: 0.50-0.94); p-value for interaction = 0.0003. An \n\nincreased incidence of hyperkalaemia (20.9% versus 17.5%), renal impairment/renal failure (16.6% \n\nversus 12.1%) and hypotension (17.1% versus 12.6%) was observed in the aliskiren group compared \n\nwith placebo and was greater in patients with diabetes. \n\n \n\nEffects of aliskiren on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nNo long-term efficacy data for aliskiren in patients with heart failure are currently available. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Rasilamlo inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both \n\ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. \n\n \n\nThe contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the \n\nmovement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilatation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in \n\nblood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine \n\nlevels with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n67 \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, \n\nvasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with heart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% vs 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was \n\nno significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRasilamlo in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC \n\n0-tau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than \n\nwith the initial dose. \n\n \n\nTransporters \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption \n\nand biliary excretion of aliskiren in pre-clinical studies. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n68 \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as \n\nunchanged compound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. \n\nThe enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is \n\nrecovered in urine following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, mean plasma \n\nclearance is approximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to \n\n17 years given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules \n\n(3.125 mg/tablet), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The results of this \n\nstudy did not suggest that age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren \n\nsystemic exposure (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nResults from an in vitro MDR1 human tissue study suggested an age and tissue dependent pattern of \n\nMDR1 (P-gp) transporter maturation. A high inter-individual variability of mRNA expression levels \n\nwas observed (up to 600-fold). Hepatic MDR1 mRNA expression was statistically significantly lower \n\nin samples from foetuses, neonates and infants up to 23 months. \n\n \n\nThe age at which the transporter system is mature cannot be determined. There is a potential for \n\naliskiren overexposure in children with an immature MDR1 (P-gp) system (see “Transporters” above \n\nand sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated as between 64% \n\nand 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, with \n\n10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration \n\nfor 7-8 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 5 mg and 10 mg. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine \n\nFollowing oral administration of Rasilamlo, the median peak plasma concentration time is within \n\n3 hours for aliskiren and 8 hours for amlodipine. The rate and extent of absorption of Rasilamlo are \n\nsimilar in fasting state to those of aliskiren and amlodipine when administered as individual \n\nmonotherapies. A bioequivalence study under light meal conditions has not been conducted for \n\nRasilamlo. \n\n \n\nThe results from a food effect study using a standard high fat meal with the 300 mg/10 mg fixed \n\ncombination tablet showed that food reduced the rate and extent of absorption of aliskiren in the \n\nfixed combination tablet with a similar magnitude of effect as for aliskiren monotherapy. Consistent \n\nwith the monotherapy formulation, food had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine in the \n\nfixed combination tablet. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \n\nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dosage of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger \n\nsubjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and \n\nelimination half-life in elderly patients. Increases in AUC and elimination half-life in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure were as expected for the patient age group in this study (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in 74 hypertensive children aged from 1 to \n\n17 years (with 34 patients aged 6 to 12 years and 28 patients aged 13 to 17 years) receiving \n\namlodipine between 1.25 and 20 mg given either once or twice daily. In children 6 to 12 years and in \n\nadolescents 13-17 years of age the typical oral clearance (CL/F) was 22.5 and 27.4 l/hr respectively \n\nin males and 16.4 and 21.3 l/hr respectively in females. Large variability in exposure between \n\nindividuals was observed. Data reported in children below 6 years are limited. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n70 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. \n\n \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with \n\nresulting increase in AUC of approximately 40-60%. Therefore caution should be exercised in \n\npatients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nJuvenile Animal Studies \n\nA repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in juvenile rats 8 days post-partum for 4 weeks with \n\naliskiren dosing at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day. High acute mortality (within hours) and severe \n\nmorbidity were observed at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day (2.3- and 6.8-fold the maximum recommended \n\nhuman dose (MRHD) on mg/m2 basis assuming a 60 kg adult patient) with no cause of death \n\nestablished and occurring without signs or prodromal symptoms. The ratio of lethal dose of \n\n100 mg/kg/day and no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day is unexpectedly low. \n\n \n\nAnother repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in juvenile rats 14 days post-partum for 8 weeks \n\nwith aliskiren dosing at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day. Delayed mortality was observed at 300 mg/kg/day \n\n(8.5-fold the MRHD on mg/m2 basis assuming a 60 kg adult patient) with no cause of death \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nFor the surviving juvenile rats, no effects on behavioural or reproductive performance were observed. \n\n \n\nPlasma aliskiren exposure (AUC) in rats aged 8 days was nearly 4-fold higher than that in rats aged \n\n14 days at 100 mg/kg/day. Plasma aliskiren exposure in rats aged 14 days was between 85- and 387-\n\nfold higher than that in adult rats aged 64 days. \n\n \n\nA single dose study was conducted in juvenile rats aged 14, 21, 24, 28, 31 or 36 days post-partum. \n\nNo mortality or significant toxicity was observed. The plasma exposure was approximately 100-fold \n\nhigher in rats aged 14 days and 3-fold higher in rats aged 21 days compared to adult rats. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n71 \n\nA mechanistic study was conducted to investigate the relationship between age, aliskiren exposure \n\nand MDR1 and OATP2 expression maturation in rats. The results showed that developmental \n\nchanges of aliskiren exposure correlated with the ontogeny of transporter maturation in jejunum, liver, \n\nkidney and brain. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren was evaluated in rats aged from 8 to 28 days after intravenous \n\nadministration of aliskiren 3 mg/kg. The clearance of aliskiren increased in an age-dependent \n\nmanner. Clearance in rats aged 8 or 14 days was similar, but at these ages the clearance was only \n\nabout 23% of clearance in rats aged 21 days and 16% of clearance in rats aged 28 days. \n\n \n\nThese studies indicate that excessive aliskiren exposure (>400-fold higher in 8-day old rats compared \n\nwith adult rats) and high acute toxicity in juvenile rats are caused by immature MDR1, which \n\nsuggests that in paediatric patients with immature MDR1, there is a potential for aliskiren \n\noverexposure (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nSafety data for amlodipine are well established both clinically and non-clinically. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose \n\nof 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no effects related to the medicinal product at either the gene or \n\nchromosome levels. \n\n \n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nRasilamlo \n\nPreclinical safety studies have demonstrated that the combination of aliskiren and amlodipine was \n\nwell tolerated in rats. The findings from the 2- and 13-week oral toxicity studies in rats were \n\nconsistent with those of aliskiren and amlodipine when both active substances are administered alone. \n\nThere were no new toxicities or increased severity of the toxicities which were associated with either \n\ncomponent. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n72 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRasilamlo 300 mg/10 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate) and 10 mg amlodipine (as \n\nbesylate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nBrown-yellow, convex, ovaloid tablet with a bevelled edge, with “T12” debossed on one side and  \n\n“NVR” on the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRasilamlo is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adult patients whose blood \n\npressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine used alone. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasilamlo is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is manifested within 1 week and the effect is near maximal at around \n\n4 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy, the dose may be \n\ntitrated up to a maximum of 300 mg aliskiren/10 mg amlodipine. Dose should be individualised and \n\nadjusted according to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo may be administered with other antihypertensive medicinal products with the exception of \n\nuse in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPosology in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine monotherapy  \n\nRasilamlo 300 mg/10 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with aliskiren 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg alone or Rasilamlo 150 mg/10 mg or \n\nRasilamlo 300 mg/5 mg. \n\n \n\nA patient who experiences dose limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be \n\nswitched to Rasilamlo containing a lower dose of that component to achieve similar blood pressure \n\nreductions. \n\n \n\nIndividual dose titration with each of the two components may be recommended before changing to \n\nthe fixed combination. When clinically appropriate and in line with the above-mentioned posology, \n\ndirect change from monotherapy to the fixed combination may be considered. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n75 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n\n(GFR 89-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 59-30 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively, see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nRasilamlo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nAmlodipine dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine have not been studied in severe hepatic \n\nimpairment; therefore, caution should be exercised when administering Rasilamlo to patients with \n\nhepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nElderly people (over 65 years) \n\nThere is limited experience with Rasilamlo, in particular in patients aged 75 years or older. \n\nTherefore, particular caution should be exercised in these patients. The recommended starting dose of \n\naliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful additional blood pressure reduction \n\nis observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasilamlo in children below age 18 have not been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in \n\nchildren aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren overexposure \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasilamlo should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Concomitant intake with fruit juice \n\nand/or drinks containing plant extracts (including herbal teas) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or \nother dihydropyridine derivatives. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of Rasilamlo with an ACEI or an ARB is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n Severe hypotension. \n\n Shock (including cardiogenic shock). \n\n Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis). \n\n Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. \n\n Children from birth to less than 2 years (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n76 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Rasilamlo therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients \n\nwith ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial \n\ninfarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and decreased renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that  \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the RAAS by combining aliskiren with an ACEI \n\nor an ARB is therefore not recommended. If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely \n\nnecessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring \n\nof renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nNo data on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are available for aliskiren in patients with heart \n\nfailure (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasilamloin the following \n\ncases: \n\n Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasilamlo, or the \n\ntreatment should start under close medical supervision. In patients with uncomplicated hypertension \n\ntreated with Rasilamlo in short-term controlled trials, the incidence of hypotension was low (0.2%). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn clinical studies aliskiren has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (serum creatinine ≥150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and ≥177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \n\nmen and/or estimated GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or \n\nrenovascular hypertension. Rasilamlo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, caution should be \n\nexercised when Rasilamlo is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction \n\nsuch as hypovolaemia (e.g. due to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, \n\netc.), heart disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible \n\nupon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-\n\nmarketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be promptly \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n77 \n\nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and \n\nthese may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic \n\ndetermination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe half life of amlodipine is prolonged and AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver \n\nfunction; dosage recommendations have not been established. Caution should be exercised when \n\nadministering Rasilamlo to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \n\nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasilamlo in patients with unilateral or \n\nbilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal \n\nproducts acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is an increased risk of renal \n\ninsufficiency, including acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with \n\naliskiren. Therefore caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment \n\nshould be discontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, \n\nthroat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal products that can cause angioedema, including \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasilamlo should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n78 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAliskiren is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and there is a potential for aliskiren overexposure in \n\nchildren with an immature P-gp drug transporter system. The age at which the transporter system is \n\nmature cannot be determined (see sections 5.2 and 5.3). Therefore, Rasilamlo is contraindicated in \n\nchildren from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years. \n\n \n\nLimited safety data are available from a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 \n\nhypertensive children aged 6 to less than 18 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasilamlo interactions \n\nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products were performed with Rasilamlo. Therefore, \n\ninformation on interactions with other medicinal products that are known for the individual active \n\nsubstances is provided in this section. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren and amlodipine does not cause meaningful changes in the steady-state \n\npharmacokinetic exposure (AUC) and the maximum concentration (Cmax) of either component in \n\nhealthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nInformation on aliskiren interactions \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n- P-gp potent inhibitors \nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The \n\nincrease may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) \n\nincreases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, \n\nconcomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n- Fruit juice and drinks containing plant extracts \nAdministration of fruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. Co-\n\nadministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC \n\nand co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. Co-\n\nadministration of orange or apple juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 62% decrease in aliskiren \n\nAUC or in a 63% decrease in aliskiren AUC, respectively. This decrease is likely due to an \n\ninhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by components of \n\nfruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, fruit juice \n\nshould not be taken together with Rasilamlo. The effect of drinks containing plant extracts (including \n\nherbal teas) on the absorption of aliskiren has not been investigated. However, compounds potentially \n\ninhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren are widely present in \n\nfruits, vegetables, and many other plant products. Therefore, drinks containing plant extracts, \n\nincluding herbal teas, should not be taken together with Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the RAAS with aliskiren, ARBs or ACEIs \n\nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACEIs, \n\nARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, stroke, \n\nhyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a \n\nsingle RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n79 \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- P-gp interactions \nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption \n\nand biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies (see section 5.2). Rifampicin, which is an \n\ninducer of P-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other \n\ninducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has \n\nnot been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of \n\nsubstrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp \n\ninhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at \n\nthe P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\n- Moderate P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved \n\nif the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\n- Medicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. \n\n \n\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \nAs with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, NSAIDs may \n\nreduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function \n\n(dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in \n\nfurther deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually \n\nreversible. Therefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\n- Furosemide and torasemide \nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see interaction with organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n80 \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n- Warfarin \nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\n- Food interactions \nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). The available clinical data do not suggest an additive effect of different types of \nfoods and/or drinks, however the potential for decreased aliskiren bioavailability due to this additive \n\neffect has not been studied and therefore cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of aliskiren \n\nwith fruit juice or drinks containing plant extracts, including herbal teas, should be avoided. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of aliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with fruit juice). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n81 \n\nInformation on amlodipine interactions \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on amlodipine \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n- CYP3A4 inhibitors \nConcomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, \n\nazole antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give \n\nrise to significant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic \n\nvariations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers \nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \n\nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma \n\nconcentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers. \n\n \n\n- Grapefruit juice \nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as \n\nbioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering \n\neffects. \n\n \n\n- Dantrolene (infusion) \nIn animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with \n\nhyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of \n\nhyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as \n\namlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of \n\nmalignant hyperthermia. \n\n \n\nEffects of amlodipine on other medicinal products \n\n- The blood pressure lowering effects of amlodipine adds to the blood pressure-lowering effects \nof other antihypertensive medicinal products. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in \na 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to \n\nlimit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine. \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, \ndigoxin, warfarin or ciclosporin. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/contraception in males and females \n\nHealthcare professionals prescribing Rasilamlo should counsel women of childbearing potential about \n\nthe potential risk during pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative antihypertensive treatment \n\nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy since Rasilamlo should not be used in \n\nwomen planning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, \n\naliskiren should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy and is contraindicated during the \n\nsecond and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n82 \n\nThe safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. Reproductive studies in rats \n\nhave shown no toxicity except for delayed date of delivery and prolonged duration of labour at \n\ndosages 50 times greater than the maximum recommended dosage for humans (see section 5.3). Use \n\nin pregnancy is only recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself \n\ncarries greater risk for the mother and foetus. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Rasilamlo is contraindicated \n\nduring the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf pregnancy is detected during therapy, Rasilamlo should be discontinued accordingly as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether aliskiren and/or amlodipine are excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was \n\nsecreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n\n \n\nSince there is insufficient/limited information on the excretion of aliskiren and amlodipine in human \n\nor animal breast milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It is therefore not \n\nrecommended for women who are breast-feeding to use Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \n\nRasilamlo therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \n\ntherapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility with the use of Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients \n\ntreated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of \n\namlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). \n\nThe fertility of rats was unaffected at doses of up to aliskiren 250 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nWhen driving vehicles or using machines it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may \n\noccasionally occur when taking Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If \n\npatients taking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea, the ability to react may \n\nbe impaired. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety profile of Rasilamlo presented below is based on clinical studies performed with \n\nRasilamlo and the known safety profile of the individual components aliskiren and amlodipine. \n\nSafety information for Rasilamlo in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions for Rasilamlo are hypotension and peripheral oedema. The \n\nadverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components of Rasilamlo (aliskiren \n\nand amlodipine) and included in the tabulated list of adverse reactions may occur with Rasilamlo. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n83 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \n\nconvention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare  \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata).

A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInvestigations \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \n\nuncommonly associated with the administration of aliskiren. In clinical studies in hypertensive \n\npatients, aliskiren had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \n\ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other medicinal products acting on \n\nthe RAAS, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nBased on the limited amount of safety data available from a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren \n\ntreatment in 39 hypertensive children 6-17 years of age, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \n\nreactions in children are expected to be similar to that seen in hypertensive adults. As for other RAAS \n\nblockers, headache is a common adverse event in children treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nExceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n86 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nThere is no experience of overdose with Rasilamlo. The most likely manifestation of overdose for \n\nRasilamlo would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren and amlodipine. \n\n \n\nWith aliskiren, the most likely manifestation of overdose would be hypotension, related to the \n\nantihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nWith amlodipine, available data suggest that gross overdose could result in excessive peripheral \n\nvasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension \n\nup to and including shock with fatal outcome, have been reported with amlodipine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur with Rasilamlo, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nClinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular \n\nsupport including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities \n\nand attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \n\n \n\nA vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is \n\nno contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the \n\neffects of calcium channel blockade. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to \n\n2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of \n\namlodipine. \n\n \n\nSince amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (<2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, renin inhibitors, ATC \n\ncode: C09XA53 \n\n \n\nRasilamlo combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control \n\nblood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: aliskiren belongs to the class of direct renin \n\ninhibitors and amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n87 \n\nRasilamlo \n\nThe use of combined treatment with aliskiren and amlodipine arises from the actions of these two \n\nmedicinal products on different but complementary systems that regulate blood pressure. Calcium \n\nchannel blockers act to prevent the influx of calcium into the vascular smooth muscle cells in the \n\nvessel wall, thereby preventing smooth muscle cell contraction and vasoconstriction. Renin inhibitors \n\nsuppress the enzymatic activity of renin, and thereby block the formation of Angiotensin II, the major \n\neffector molecule of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Angiotensin II causes \n\nvasoconstriction and sodium and water reabsorption. Thus, amlodipine directly inhibits \n\nvasoconstriction and reduces vascular resistance, while aliskiren, by controlling Ang II production, \n\ncan also inhibit vasoconstriction but additionally shifts water and sodium balance toward levels \n\nnecessary for normotensive conditions. The combined action of aliskiren and amlodipine on these two \n\ncentral blood pressure-regulating factors (vasoconstriction and RAAS-mediated hypertensive effects) \n\nresults in more effective antihypertensive effects than seen with monotherapy. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo was studied in a number of active and placebo-controlled trials and long-term trials which \n\nincluded a total of 5,570 hypertensive patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood \n\npressure between 90 mmHg and 109 mmHg). \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients not controlled by the component monotherapies, once-daily administration of \n\nRasilamlo provided dose-dependent clinically meaningful reductions in both systolic and diastolic \n\nblood pressure. \n\n \n\nWhen given to patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by either aliskiren or \n\namlodipine, Rasilamlo results in greater blood pressure reductions after one week of treatment than \n\nthe component monotherapies and a near-maximal effect is achieved after four weeks of therapy. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 820 randomised patients not adequately responsive to aliskiren 300 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine 300 mg/10 mg produced systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 18.0/13.1 mmHg, which were statistically significantly greater than aliskiren 300 mg \n\nmonotherapy. The combination at a dose of 300 mg/5 mg also showed statistically significantly \n\ngreater blood pressure reduction than aliskiren 300 mg monotherapy. In a subset of 584 patients, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine produced additional systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 7.9/4.8 mmHg and 11.7/7.7 mmHg for the 300/5 mg and 300/10 mg strengths \n\nrespectively compared to aliskiren 300 mg (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, \n\ndefined as difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nIn a study in 847 randomised patients not adequately responsive to amlodipine 10 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine 150 mg/10 mg and 300 mg/10 mg produced systolic/diastolic \n\nmean blood pressure reductions of 11.0/9.0 mmHg and 14.4/11.0 mmHg respectively, which were \n\nstatistically greater than for amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy. In a subset of 549 patients, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/amlodipine produced additional systolic/diastolic mean blood pressure \n\nreductions of 4.0/2.2 mmHg and 7.6/4.7 mmHg for the 150/10 mg and 300/10 mg strengths \n\nrespectively compared to amlodipine 10 mg (the subset constitutes patients without aberrant readings, \n\ndefined as difference in SBP ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nIn a study in 545 randomised patients not adequately responsive to 5 mg amlodipine, the combination \n\nof aliskiren 150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg resulted in greater blood pressure reduction than those patients \n\nremaining on amlodipine 5 mg. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n88 \n\nIn an 8-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study in \n\n1,688 randomised patients with mild to moderate hypertension, treatment with Rasilamlo at doses \n\nfrom 150 mg/5 mg to 300 mg/10 mg produced dose-dependent clinically meaningful mean blood \n\npressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) ranging between 20.6/14.0 mmHg and 23.9/16.5 mmHg, \n\nrespectively, compared to 15.4/10.2 mmHg for aliskiren 300 mg, 21.0/13.8 mmHg for amlodipine \n\n10 mg and 6.8/5.4 mmHg with placebo in a population of patients with mean baseline blood pressure \n\nof 157.3/99.7 mmHg. These were statistically significant versus placebo and aliskiren for all doses. \n\nThe blood pressure reductions with the combination were maintained throughout the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. In a subset of 1,069 patients, Rasilamlo produced mean blood pressure reductions \n\n(systolic/diastolic) ranging between 20.6/13.6 mmHg and 24.2/17.3 mmHg (the subset of patients \n\nwithout aberrant readings, defined as difference in SBP ≥10 mmHg at baseline or endpoint). \n\n \n\nThe safety of Rasilamlo has been evaluated in studies of up to one year duration. \n\n \n\nThe effects of Rasilamlo on all cause and cardiovascular mortality and on cardiovascular morbidity \n\nand target organ damage are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nRasilamlo has been administered to more than 2,800 patients in completed clinical trials, including \n\n372 patients for one year or more. Treatment with Rasilamlo at doses up to 300 mg/10 mg had an \n\noverall incidence of adverse experiences similar to the component monotherapies. The incidence of \n\nadverse events did not show any association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. \n\nThere were no new adverse reactions which occurred specifically with Rasilamlo in addition to those \n\nknown to be associated with the individual monotherapies. In a double-blind, randomised placebo-\n\ncontrolled study in 1,688 patients with mild or moderate hypertension, discontinuation of therapy due \n\nto a clinical adverse event occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with Rasilamlo versus 1.5% of \n\npatients given placebo. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other medicinal products that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with \n\naliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions \n\nwere found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive medicinal products. The \n\nclinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were \n\nmaintained over the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a \n\nmean peak to trough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the \n\nmaximal blood-pressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering \n\neffect was sustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass \n\nindex and ethnicity. Aliskiren has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in \n\n426 patients aged 75 years or older. \n\n \n\nAliskiren monotherapy studies have shown blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to other \n\nclasses of antihypertensive medicinal products including selected ACEI and ARB. Compared to a \n\ndiuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ), aliskiren 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by \n\n17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide and \n\nthe beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well tolerated. Aliskiren induced an additive \n\nblood-pressure-lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n89 \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction \n\nin blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood \n\npressure lowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three \n\ndoses were well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with aliskiren alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive medicinal products. With cessation of \n\ntreatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, \n\nwith no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nThe final study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.097 in favour of placebo \n\n(95.4% Confidence Interval: 0.987, 1.218, 2-sided p=0.0787). In addition, an increased incidence of \n\nadverse events was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (38.2% versus 30.3%). In particular \n\nthere was an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.5% versus 12.4%), hyperkalaemia (39.1% \n\nversus 29.0%), hypotension-related events (19.9% versus 16.3%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints \n\n(3.4% versus 2.7%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal \n\ninsufficiency. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n90 \n\nAliskiren 150 mg (increased to 300 mg if tolerated) added to conventional therapy was evaluated in a \n\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial in 1,639 patients with reduced ejection fraction \n\nhospitalised for an episode of acute heart failure (NYHA Class III–IV) who were haemodynamically \n\nstable at baseline. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death or heart failure rehospitalisation \n\nwithin 6 months; secondary endpoints were assessed within 12 months. \n\n \n\nThe study showed no benefit of aliskiren when administered on top of standard therapy for acute \n\nheart failure and an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Study \n\nresults indicated a non-significant effect of aliskiren with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% Confidence \n\nInterval: 0.76-1.12; p=0.41, aliskiren vs. placebo). Different treatment effects of aliskiren were \n\nreported for overall mortality within 12 months dependent on diabetes mellitus status. In the subgroup \n\nof patients with diabetes mellitus the hazard ratio was 1.64 in favour of placebo (95% Confidence \n\nInterval: 1.15-2.33), whereas the hazard ratio in the subgroup of patients without diabetes was 0.69 in \n\nfavour of aliskiren (95% Confidence Interval: 0.50-0.94); p-value for interaction = 0.0003. An \n\nincreased incidence of hyperkalaemia (20.9% versus 17.5%), renal impairment/renal failure (16.6% \n\nversus 12.1%) and hypotension (17.1% versus 12.6%) was observed in the aliskiren group compared \n\nwith placebo and was greater in patients with diabetes. \n\n \n\nEffects of aliskiren on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. \n\n \n\nNo long-term efficacy data for aliskiren in patients with heart failure are currently available. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe amlodipine component of Rasilamlo inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into \n\ncardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is \n\ndue to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular \n\nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both \n\ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. \n\n \n\nThe contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the \n\nmovement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces \n\nvasodilatation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in \n\nblood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine \n\nlevels with chronic dosing. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \n\ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \n\nplasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\n \n\nAs with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and \n\nduring exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have \n\ngenerally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on \n\nleft ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been \n\nassociated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact \n\nanimals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n91 \n\nAmlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals \n\nor humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta \n\nblockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic \n\nparameters were observed. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, \n\nvasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with heart failure \n\nCalcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with hypertension \n\nA randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-\n\nLowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer \n\ntherapies: amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-\n\ninhibitor) as first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild \n\nto moderate hypertension. \n\n \n\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of \n\n4.9 years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: \n\nprevious myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other \n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), high density \n\nlipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed \n\nby electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%). \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial \n\ninfarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based \n\ntherapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95% CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among \n\nsecondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined \n\ncardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the \n\nchlorthalidone group (10.2% vs 7.7%, RR 1.38, 95% CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there was \n\nno significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-\n\nbased therapy RR 0.96 95% CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRasilamlo in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC \n\n0-tau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than \n\nwith the initial dose. \n\n \n\nTransporters \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption \n\nand biliary excretion of aliskiren in pre-clinical studies. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n92 \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as \n\nunchanged compound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. \n\nThe enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is \n\nrecovered in urine following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, mean plasma \n\nclearance is approximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to \n\n17 years given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules \n\n(3.125 mg/tablet), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The results of this \n\nstudy did not suggest that age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren \n\nsystemic exposure (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nResults from an in vitro MDR1 human tissue study suggested an age and tissue dependent pattern of \n\nMDR1 (P-gp) transporter maturation. A high inter-individual variability of mRNA expression levels \n\nwas observed (up to 600-fold). Hepatic MDR1 mRNA expression was statistically significantly lower \n\nin samples from foetuses, neonates and infants up to 23 months. \n\n \n\nThe age at which the transporter system is mature cannot be determined. There is a potential for \n\naliskiren overexposure in children with an immature MDR1 (P-gp) system (see “Transporters” above \n\nand sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of \n\namlodipine are reached in 6-12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated as between 64% \n\nand 80%. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that \n\napproximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAmlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites, with \n\n10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of \n\napproximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration \n\nfor 7-8 days. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 5 mg and 10 mg. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n93 \n\n \n\nAliskiren/amlodipine \n\nFollowing oral administration of Rasilamlo, the median peak plasma concentration time is within \n\n3 hours for aliskiren and 8 hours for amlodipine. The rate and extent of absorption of Rasilamlo are \n\nsimilar in fasting state to those of aliskiren and amlodipine when administered as individual \n\nmonotherapies. A bioequivalence study under light meal conditions has not been conducted for \n\nRasilamlo. \n\n \n\nThe results from a food effect study using a standard high fat meal with the 300 mg/10 mg fixed \n\ncombination tablet showed that food reduced the rate and extent of absorption of aliskiren in the \n\nfixed combination tablet with a similar magnitude of effect as for aliskiren monotherapy. Consistent \n\nwith the monotherapy formulation, food had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine in the \n\nfixed combination tablet. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \n\nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dosage of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger \n\nsubjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and \n\nelimination half-life in elderly patients. Increases in AUC and elimination half-life in patients with \n\ncongestive heart failure were as expected for the patient age group in this study (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in 74 hypertensive children aged from 1 to \n\n17 years (with 34 patients aged 6 to 12 years and 28 patients aged 13 to 17 years) receiving \n\namlodipine between 1.25 and 20 mg given either once or twice daily. In children 6 to 12 years and in \n\nadolescents 13-17 years of age the typical oral clearance (CL/F) was 22.5 and 27.4 l/hr respectively \n\nin males and 16.4 and 21.3 l/hr respectively in females. Large variability in exposure between \n\nindividuals was observed. Data reported in children below 6 years are limited. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n94 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. \n\n \n\nVery limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with \n\nresulting increase in AUC of approximately 40-60%. Therefore caution should be exercised in \n\npatients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nJuvenile Animal Studies \n\nA repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in juvenile rats 8 days post-partum for 4 weeks with \n\naliskiren dosing at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day. High acute mortality (within hours) and severe \n\nmorbidity were observed at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day (2.3- and 6.8-fold the maximum recommended \n\nhuman dose (MRHD) on mg/m2 basis assuming a 60 kg adult patient) with no cause of death \n\nestablished and occurring without signs or prodromal symptoms. The ratio of lethal dose of \n\n100 mg/kg/day and no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day is unexpectedly low. \n\n \n\nAnother repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted in juvenile rats 14 days post-partum for 8 weeks \n\nwith aliskiren dosing at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day. Delayed mortality was observed at 300 mg/kg/day \n\n(8.5-fold the MRHD on mg/m2 basis assuming a 60 kg adult patient) with no cause of death \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nFor the surviving juvenile rats, no effects on behavioural or reproductive performance were observed. \n\n \n\nPlasma aliskiren exposure (AUC) in rats aged 8 days was nearly 4-fold higher than that in rats aged \n\n14 days at 100 mg/kg/day. Plasma aliskiren exposure in rats aged 14 days was between 85- and 387-\n\nfold higher than that in adult rats aged 64 days. \n\n \n\nA single dose study was conducted in juvenile rats aged 14, 21, 24, 28, 31 or 36 days post-partum. \n\nNo mortality or significant toxicity was observed. The plasma exposure was approximately 100-fold \n\nhigher in rats aged 14 days and 3-fold higher in rats aged 21 days compared to adult rats. \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n95 \n\nA mechanistic study was conducted to investigate the relationship between age, aliskiren exposure \n\nand MDR1 and OATP2 expression maturation in rats. The results showed that developmental \n\nchanges of aliskiren exposure correlated with the ontogeny of transporter maturation in jejunum, liver, \n\nkidney and brain. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren was evaluated in rats aged from 8 to 28 days after intravenous \n\nadministration of aliskiren 3 mg/kg. The clearance of aliskiren increased in an age-dependent \n\nmanner. Clearance in rats aged 8 or 14 days was similar, but at these ages the clearance was only \n\nabout 23% of clearance in rats aged 21 days and 16% of clearance in rats aged 28 days. \n\n \n\nThese studies indicate that excessive aliskiren exposure (>400-fold higher in 8-day old rats compared \n\nwith adult rats) and high acute toxicity in juvenile rats are caused by immature MDR1, which \n\nsuggests that in paediatric patients with immature MDR1, there is a potential for aliskiren \n\noverexposure (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAmlodipine \n\nSafety data for amlodipine are well established both clinically and non-clinically. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\nReproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of \n\nlabour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum \n\nrecommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg. \n\n \n\nImpairment of fertility \n\nThere was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females \n\n14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human \n\ndose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine \n\nbesilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma \n\nfollicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in \n\nthe number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \n\nRats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to \n\nprovide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\nThe highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose \n\nof 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity studies revealed no effects related to the medicinal product at either the gene or \n\nchromosome levels. \n\n \n\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg \n\n \n\nRasilamlo \n\nPreclinical safety studies have demonstrated that the combination of aliskiren and amlodipine was \n\nwell tolerated in rats. The findings from the 2- and 13-week oral toxicity studies in rats were \n\nconsistent with those of aliskiren and amlodipine when both active substances are administered alone. \n\nThere were no new toxicities or increased severity of the toxicities which were associated with either \n\ncomponent. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n96 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Rasilamlo is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Rasilamlo is \n\nRasilamlo contains two active substances, called aliskiren and amlodipine. Both of these substances \n\nhelp to control high blood pressure (hypertension). \n\n \n\nAliskiren is a renin inhibitor. It reduces the amount of angiotensin II the body can make. \n\nAngiotensin II causes blood vessels to tighten, which raises blood pressure. Lowering the amount of \n\nangiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax; this lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nAmlodipine belongs to a group of medicines known as calcium channel blockers, which help to \n\ncontrol high blood pressure. Amlodipine causes blood vessels to dilate and relax, thus blood pressure \n\nis lowered. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \n\nof developing these disorders. \n\n \n\nWhat Rasilamlo is used for \n\nRasilamlo is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nsufficiently controlled with aliskiren or amlodipine alone. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n136 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rasilamlo \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasilamlo \n\n- if you are allergic to aliskiren or amlodipine, to any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6) or to other dihydropyridine-derived medicines (known as calcium channel \n\nblockers) \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren \n- hereditary angioedema \n- angioedema without any known cause \n\n- if you are between three and nine months pregnant \n- if you are taking any of the following medicines \n\n- ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for other \nconditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis) \n\n- itraconazole (a medicine used to treat fungal infections) \n- quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm) \n\n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril \nor \n\n- an angiotensin II receptor blocker such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan \n- if the patient is less than 2 years of age \n- if you have very low blood pressure \n- if you are suffering from shock, including cardiogenic shock \n- if you have a narrowing of the aortic heart valve (aortic stenosis) \n- if you have heart failure after an acute heart attack \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Rasilamlo and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasilamlo: \n\n- if you are suffering from vomiting or diarrhoea or if you are taking a diuretic (a medicine to \nincrease the amount of urine you produce) \n\n- if you have already experienced angioedema (difficulties in breathing or swallowing, or \nswelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking \n\nRasilamlo and contact your doctor \n\n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril \nor \n\n- an angiotensin II receptor blocker such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan \n- if you have diabetes (high blood sugar) \n- if you suffer from heart problems \n- if you are on a low-salt diet \n- if your urine flow has decreased markedly for 24 hours or more and/or if you have serious \n\nkidney problems (e.g. require dialysis) or a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply \n\nblood to your kidney \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether Rasilamlo is \nsuitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully \n\n- if you suffer from liver problems (impaired liver function) \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n137 \n\n- if you have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one of both kidneys) \n- if you have serious congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot \n\npump enough blood around the body) \n\n \n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \n\npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n\n \n\nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Rasilamlo”. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nRasilamlo is for use in adults. \n\nRasilamlo must not be used in children from birth to less than 2 years of age. It should not be used in \n\nchildren from 2 to less than 6 years of age, and is not recommended for use in children and \n\nadolescents from 6 to less than 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\nIn the majority of patients aged 65 years or older, the 300 mg dose of aliskiren shows no additional \n\nbenefit in reducing blood pressure compared to the 150 mg dose. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Rasilamlo \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are using the following medicines: \n\n- an angiotensin II receptor blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (see also \ninformation under the headings “Do not take Rasilamlo” and “Warnings and precautions”) \n\n- medicines used to lower blood pressure, diuretics (medicines to increase the amount of urine \nyou produce), especially potassium-sparing medicines, potassium supplements, potassium-\n\ncontaining salt substitutes, or heparin \n\n- ketoconazole, a medicine used to treat fungal infections \n- verapamil, a medicine used to lower high blood pressure, to correct heart rhythm or to treat \n\nangina pectoris \n\n- clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin which are antibiotics used to treat infections \n- amiodarone, a medicine used to treat abnormal heart rhythms \n- atorvastatin, a medicine used to treat high cholesterol \n- furosemide or torasemide, medicines belonging to the type known as diuretics, which are used \n\nto increase the amount of urine you produce and are also used to treat a certain kind of heart \n\nproblem (heart failure) or oedema (swelling) \n\n- antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone) \n- rifampicin, a medicine used to prevent or treat infections \n- St. John’s wort (hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine used to elevate mood \n- certain types of pain killers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) (used \n\nespecially in patients over 65 years old) \n\n- diltiazem, a medicine used to treat heart problems \n- ritonavir, a medicine used to treat viral infection \n \n\nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or take other precautions if you are taking one of \n\nthe following medicines: \n\n- furosemide or torasemide, medicines belonging to the type known as diuretics, which are used \nto increase the amount of urine you produce and are also used to treat a certain kind of heart \n\nproblem (heart failure) or oedema (swelling) \n\n- some medicines used to treat infections, such as ketoconazole \n \n\nRasilamlo with food and drink \n\nYou should avoid taking this medicine together with fruit juice and/or drinks containing plant \n\nextracts (including herbal teas). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n138 \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant (see section Do not take Rasilamlo). If you become \n\npregnant while taking this medicine, stop taking it immediately and talk to your doctor. If you think \n\nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before \n\ntaking this medicine. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Rasilamlo before you \n\nbecome pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Rasilamlo. Rasilamlo is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it \n\nmay cause serious harm to your baby if it is used after the third month of pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Rasilamlo is not \n\nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \n\nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nAmlodipine, one of the active substances in Rasilamlo, may make you feel dizzy and drowsy. If you \n\nexperience this symptom, do not drive or use tools or machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Rasilamlo \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you and do not exceed the recommended \n\ndose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Rasilamlo is one tablet a day. \n\nThe effect on blood pressure is seen within 1 week and maximum effect is reached at around 4 weeks. \n\nIf your blood pressure is not controlled after 4 to 6 weeks, your doctor may adjust your dose. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nSwallow the tablet whole with some water. You should take this medicine with a light meal once a \n\nday, preferably at the same time each day. You should avoid taking this medicine together with fruit \n\njuice and/or drinks containing plant extracts (including herbal teas). During your treatment, your \n\ndoctor may adjust your dose depending on your blood pressure response. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Rasilamlo than you should \n\nIf you have accidentally taken too many Rasilamlo tablets, talk to a doctor immediately. You may \n\nrequire medical attention. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Rasilamlo \n\nIf you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next \n\ndose at its usual time. If you only remember the forgotten dose the next day, you should simply take \n\nthe next tablet at the usual time. Do not take a double dose (two tablets at once) to make up for a \n\nforgotten tablet. \n\n \n\nDo not stop taking this medicine, even if you are feeling well unless your doctor tells you to do so. \n\nPeople who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many may feel \n\nquite normal. It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get \n\nthe best results and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if \n\nyou are feeling well. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nsed\n\n \n\n139 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nFainting and/or light-headedness linked to low blood pressure could occur at the beginning of \n\ntreatment with Rasilamlo.

The cumulative review \n\nretrieved 187 cases out of which 57 were sufficiently documented, in 8 of these cases a causal \n\nrelationship could not be ruled out. In 3 additional cases where severe hyponatremia was associated \n\nwith neurological symptoms such as brain oedema or major confusion and cerebral oedema, \n\ncausality could also not be excluded. \n\n \n\nThe MAH submitted an analysis with 1407 cases of “dyspnoea”, in 13 of them there was positive \n\ndechallenge and three cases with positive rechallenge. The PRAC considered the cases of \n\ndechallenge and rechallenge to be important causal relationship information that contributes to \n\nconfirm the safety signal. \n\n \n\nTherefore, in view of available data regarding aliskiren/ aliskiren,amlodipine / aliskiren, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation \n\n \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for aliskiren / aliskiren, amlodipine / aliskiren, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal \n\nproduct(s) containing aliskiren / aliskiren, amlodipine / aliskiren, hydrochlorothiazide is favourable \n\nsubject to the proposed changes to the product information. \n\n \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
