NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nViread 123 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 123 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate). \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach tablet contains 82 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nWhite, triangle-shaped, film-coated tablets, 8.5 mm in diameter, debossed on one side with “GSI” and \non the other side with “150”. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHIV-1 infection \nViread 123 mg film-coated tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts for the treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, with NRTI resistance or toxicities \nprecluding the use of first line agents, aged 6 to < 12 years who weigh from 17 kg to less than 22 kg. \n \nThe choice of Viread to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be based \non individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. \n \nHepatitis B infection \nViread 123 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in paediatric \npatients aged 6 to < 12 years who weigh from 17 kg to less than 22 kg, with: \n \n• compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication \n\nand persistently elevated serum ALT levels, or histological evidence of moderate to severe \ninflammation and/or fibrosis.  With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in paediatric \npatients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection and/or \ntreatment of chronic hepatitis B. \n \nPosology \n \nHIV-1 and Chronic hepatitis B \nThe recommended dose for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in paediatric \npatients aged 6 to < 12 years weighing 17 kg to < 22 kg who are able to swallow film-coated tablets is \none 123 mg tablet once daily taken orally with food. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPlease refer to the Summaries of Product Characteristics for Viread 163 mg and 204 mg film-coated \ntablets for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in paediatric patients aged \n6 to < 12 years weighing 22 kg to < 28 kg and 28 kg to < 35 kg, respectively. \n \nViread is also available as 33 mg/g granules for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis \nB in paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years who weigh < 17 kg or who are unable to swallow \nfilm-coated tablets.  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Viread 33 mg/g \ngranules. \n \nThe decision to treat paediatric patients should be based on careful consideration of individual patient \nneeds and with reference to current paediatric treatment guidelines including the value of baseline \nhistological information.  The benefits of long-term virologic suppression with continued therapy must \nbe weighed against the risk of prolonged treatment, including the emergence of resistant hepatitis B \nvirus and the uncertainties as regards the long term impact of bone and renal toxicity (see section 4.4). \n \nSerum ALT should be persistently elevated for at least 6 months prior to treatment of paediatric \npatients with compensated liver disease due to HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B; and for at least 12 \nmonths in patients with HBeAg negative disease. \n \nDuration of therapy in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis B \n \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown.  Treatment discontinuation may be considered as \nfollows: \n \n- In HBeAg positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least \n\n12 months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe detection \non two consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) is confirmed or until \nHBs seroconversion or there is loss of efficacy (see section 4.4).  Serum ALT and HBV DNA \nlevels should be followed regularly after treatment discontinuation to detect any late virological \nrelapse. \n\n \n- In HBeAg negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until \n\nHBs seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy.  Treatment discontinuation may \nalso be considered after stable virological suppression is achieved (i.e. for at least 3 years) \nprovided serum ALT and HBV DNA levels are followed regularly after treatment \ndiscontinuation to detect any late virological relapse.  With prolonged treatment for more than \n2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected therapy \nremains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \nMissed dose \nIf a patient misses a dose of Viread within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Viread with food as soon as possible and resume their normal dosing schedule.  If a patient \nmisses a dose of Viread by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for their next dose, the patient \nshould not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Viread, another tablet should be taken.  If the patient \nvomits more than 1 hour after taking Viread they do not need to take another dose. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIf Viread 123 mg film-coated tablets are discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B \nvirus (HBV), these patients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected children or children with \nchronic hepatitis B under 2 years of age have not been established.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nViread 123 mg film-coated tablets should be taken once daily, orally with food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nHIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV infected patients before initiating tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy (see below Co-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B). \n \nHIV-1 \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nHepatitis B \nPatients must be advised that tenofovir disoproxil has not been proven to prevent the risk of \ntransmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.  Appropriate \nprecautions must continue to be used. \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \n\ntenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n- Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see Section 4.5).   \n \nTriple therapy with nucleosides/nucleotides \nThere have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early \nstage in HIV patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well \nas with lamivudine and didanosine as a once-daily regimen. \n \nRenal and bone effects in adult population \nRenal effects \nTenofovir is principally eliminated via the kidney.  Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated \ncreatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been \nreported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil in clinical practice (see section 4.8). \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal safety with tenofovir has only been studied to a very limited degree in adult patients with \nimpaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min). \n \nBone effects \nIn HIV infected patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil \nwith stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve adult patients, \nsmall decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment \ngroups.  Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly \n\n\n\n5 \n\ngreater in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks.  Decreases in BMD of hip were \nsignificantly greater in this group until 96 weeks.  However, there was no increased risk of fractures or \nevidence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks. \n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen \nin patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \ninhibitor.  Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are \nat a high risk for fractures. \n \nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \ntubulopathy (see section 4.8). \n \nRenal and bone effects in paediatric population \nThere are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity.  Moreover, the \nreversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is \nrecommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide \nthe appropriate monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and \nconsider the need for supplementation. \n \nRenal effects \nRenal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in \nHIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nRenal monitoring \nIt is recommended that renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) is assessed in all \npatients prior to initiating therapy with tenofovir disoproxil and that it is also monitored after two to \nfour weeks of treatment, after three months of treatment and every three to six months thereafter in \npatients without renal risk factors.  In patients at risk for renal impairment, a more frequent monitoring \nof renal function is required. \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving \ntenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements \nof blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal \ntubulopathy).  If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist \nshould be obtained to consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil treatment.  Interrupting treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function \nwhen no other cause has been identified. \n \nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, \nvancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2).  If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil and nephrotoxic \nagents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. \n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors \nfor renal dysfunction.  If tenofovir disoproxil is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should \nbe monitored adequately. \n \nA higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil in \ncombination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor.  A close monitoring of renal \nfunction is required in these patients (see section 4.5).  In patients with renal risk factors, the \nco-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully \nevaluated. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTenofovir disoproxil has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which \nare secreted by the same renal pathway, including the transport proteins human organic anion \ntransporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product).  These \nrenal transport proteins may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of \ntenofovir and cidofovir.  Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products, which are \nsecreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 or MRP 4, might be \nmodified if they are co-administered.  Unless clearly necessary, concomitant use of these medicinal \nproducts which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not recommended, but if such use is \nunavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2).  Tenofovir disoproxil should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal impairment \nand should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy. \n \nBone effects \nViread may cause a reduction in BMD.  The effects of tenofovir disoproxil-associated changes in \nBMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown (see section 5.1). \n \nIf bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with an \nendocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. \n \nLiver disease \nTenofovir and tenofovir disoproxil are not metabolised by liver enzymes.  A pharmacokinetic study \nhas been performed in non-HIV infected adult patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment.  \nNo significant pharmacokinetic alteration has been observed in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis \nFlares on treatment: Spontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are \ncharacterised by transient increases in serum ALT.  After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may \nincrease in some patients (see section 4.8).  In patients with compensated liver disease, these increases \nin serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or \nhepatic decompensation.  Patients with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation \nfollowing hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. \n \nFlares after treatment discontinuation: Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been reported in \npatients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy.  Post-treatment exacerbations are usually \nassociated with rising HBV DNA, and the majority appears to be self-limited.  However, severe \nexacerbations, including fatalities, have been reported.  Hepatic function should be monitored at \nrepeated intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after \ndiscontinuation of hepatitis B therapy.  If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be \nwarranted.  In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not \nrecommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. \n \nLiver flares are especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated liver disease. \n \nCo-infection with hepatitis C or D: There are no data on the efficacy of tenofovir in patients \nco-infected with hepatitis C or D virus. \n \nCo-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B: Due to the risk of development of HIV resistance, tenofovir \ndisoproxil should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients.  Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active \nhepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART) and should be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is \nevidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must \n\n\n\n7 \n\nbe considered.  However, it should be noted that increases of ALT can be part of HBV clearance \nduring therapy with tenofovir, see above Exacerbations of hepatitis. \n \nUse with certain hepatitis C virus antiviral agents \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, \nespecially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).  The safety of tenofovir disoproxil in the setting of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established.  The potential risks and benefits associated with \nco-administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with tenofovir disoproxil given in conjunction with a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, particularly in patients at \nincreased risk of renal dysfunction.  Patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported, particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nExcipients \n \nViread 123 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate.  Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should \nnot take this medicine. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nBased on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the \npotential for CYP450-mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir \ndisoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nDidanosine \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and \nTable 1). \n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products \nSince tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with \nmedicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport \nproteins hOAT 1, hOAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir \nand/or the co-administered medicinal products. \n \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, \nfoscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). \n \nGiven that tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when it is \nco-administered with tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nOther interactions \nInteractions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below \n(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, and once daily \nas “q.d.”). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 1: Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\n(dose in mg) \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, \n\nCmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with 245 mg \n\ntenofovir disoproxil  \nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntiretrovirals \nProtease inhibitors \nAtazanavir/Ritonavir \n(300 q.d./100 q.d.) \n\nAtazanavir: \nAUC: ↓ 25% \nCmax: ↓ 28% \nCmin: ↓ 26% \nTenofovir: \nAUC: ↑ 37% \nCmax: ↑ 34% \nCmin: ↑ 29% \n\nNo dose adjustment is \nrecommended.

Rarely, pancreatitis and \nlactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, \nhave been reported.  \nCo-administration of tenofovir \ndisoproxil and didanosine at a \ndose of 400 mg daily has been \nassociated with a significant \ndecrease in CD4 cell count, \npossibly due to an intracellular \ninteraction increasing \nphosphorylated (i.e. active) \ndidanosine.  A decreased dosage \nof 250 mg didanosine \nco-administered with tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy has been \nassociated with reports of high \nrates of virological failure within \nseveral tested combinations for the \ntreatment of HIV-1 infection. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\n(dose in mg) \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, \n\nCmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with 245 mg \n\ntenofovir disoproxil  \nAdefovir dipivoxil AUC: ↔ \n\nCmax: ↔ \nTenofovir disoproxil should not be \nadministered concurrently with \nadefovir dipivoxil \n(see section 4.4). \n\nHepatitis C virus antiviral agents \nLedipasvir/Sofosbuvir \n(90 mg/400 mg q.d.) + \nAtazanavir/Ritonavir \n(300 mg q.d./100 mg q.d.) + \nEmtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil  \n(200 mg/245 mg q.d.)1 \n\nLedipasvir: \nAUC: ↑ 96% \nCmax: ↑ 68% \nCmin: ↑ 118% \n \nSofosbuvir: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n \nGS-3310072: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \nCmin: ↑ 42% \n \nAtazanavir: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \nCmin: ↑ 63% \n \nRitonavir: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \nCmin: ↑ 45% \n \nEmtricitabine: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \nCmin: ↔ \n \nTenofovir: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmax: ↑ 47% \nCmin: ↑ 47% \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations \nof tenofovir resulting from \nco-administration of tenofovir \ndisoproxil, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir \nand atazanavir/ritonavir may \nincrease adverse reactions related \nto tenofovir disoproxil, including \nrenal disorders.

Animal studies do not \nindicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The use of tenofovir disoproxil may be considered \nduring pregnancy, if necessary. \n \nIn the literature, exposure to tenofovir disoproxil in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to \nreduce the risk of HBV transmission from mother to infant if tenofovir disoproxil is given to mothers, \nin addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine in infants.  \n\nIn three controlled clinical trials, a total of 327 pregnant women with chronic HBV infection were \nadministered tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg) once daily from 28 to 32 weeks gestation through 1 to 2 \nmonths postpartum; women and their infants were followed for up to 12 months after delivery.  No \nsafety signal has emerged from these data. \n\nBreast-feeding \nTenofovir has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the \neffects of tenofovir in newborns/infants.  Therefore Viread should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nAs a general rule, it is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants in order \nto avoid transmission of HIV to the infant. \n \nFertility \nThere are limited clinical data with respect to the effect of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility.  Animal \nstudies do not indicate harmful effects of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, \npatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil, rare events of renal impairment, \nrenal failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \nsometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have been reported.  \nMonitoring of renal function is recommended for patients receiving Viread (see section 4.4). \n \nHIV-1: Approximately one third of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions following \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  These reactions \nare usually mild to moderate gastrointestinal events.  Approximately 1% of tenofovir \ndisoproxil-treated adult patients discontinued treatment due to the gastrointestinal events. \n \n \nHepatitis B: Approximately one quarter of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions \nfollowing treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, most of which are mild.  In clinical trials of \nHBV infected patients, the most frequently occurring adverse reaction to tenofovir disoproxil was \nnausea (5.4%). \n \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients on treatment as well as in patients who \nhave discontinued hepatitis B therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nAssessment of adverse reactions for tenofovir disoproxil is based on safety data from clinical studies \nand post-marketing experience.  All adverse reactions are presented in Table 2. \n \nHIV-1 clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on \nexperience in two studies in 653 treatment-experienced adult patients receiving treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil (n = 443) or placebo (n = 210) in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts for 24 weeks and also in a double-blind comparative controlled study in which 600 \ntreatment-naïve adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 299) or \nstavudine (n = 301) in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz for 144 weeks. \n \nHepatitis B clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HBV clinical study data is \nprimarily based on experience in two double-blind comparative controlled studies in which 641 adult \npatients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg  daily (n = 426) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily (n = 215) for 48 weeks.  The \nadverse reactions observed with continued treatment for 384 weeks were consistent with the safety \nprofile of tenofovir disoproxil.  After an initial decline of approximately -4.9 ml/min (using \nCockcroft-Gault equation) or -3.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (using modification of diet in renal disease \n[MDRD] equation) after the first 4 weeks of treatment, the rate of annual decline post baseline of renal \nfunction reported in tenofovir disoproxil treated patients was -1.41 ml/min per year (using \nCockcroft-Gault equation) and -0.74 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (using MDRD equation). \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPatients with decompensated liver disease: The safety profile of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with \ndecompensated liver disease was assessed in a double-blind active controlled study \n(GS-US-174-0108) in which adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or entecavir (n = 22) for 48 weeks. \n \nIn the tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse \nevent; 9% of patients experienced a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl through week 48; there were no statistically significant \ndifferences between the combined tenofovir-containing arms and the entecavir arm.  After 168 weeks, \n16% (7/45) of the tenofovir disoproxil group, 4% (2/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup, and 14% (3/22) of the entecavir group experienced tolerability failure.  Thirteen percent (6/45) \nof the tenofovir disoproxil group, 13% (6/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group, and \n9% (2/22) of the entecavir group had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nAt week 168, in this population of patients with decompensated liver disease, the rate of death was of \n13% (6/45) in the tenofovir disoproxil group, 11% (5/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup and 14% (3/22) in the entecavir group.  The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was 18% (8/45) in \nthe tenofovir disoproxil group, 7% (3/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group and 9% \n(2/22) in the entecavir group. \n \nSubjects with a high baseline CPT score were at higher risk of developing serious adverse events \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B: No new adverse reactions to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified from a randomised, double-blind study (GS-US-174-0121) in which 280 \nlamivudine-resistant patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 141) or \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (n = 139) for 240 weeks. \n \nThe adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment are listed below by \nbody system organ class and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil based on \nclinical study and post-marketing experience \n \nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common: hypophosphataemia1 \nUncommon: hypokalaemia1 \nRare: lactic acidosis \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common: dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \nCommon: flatulence \nUncommon: pancreatitis \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nCommon: increased transaminases \nRare: hepatic steatosis, hepatitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common: rash \nRare: angioedema \n\n\n\n23 \n\nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nUncommon: rhabdomyolysis1, muscular weakness1 \n\nRare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures)\n1, \n\n2, myopathy1 \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nUncommon: increased creatinine, proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \n\nRare: acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, nephritis (including acute interstitial nephritis)2, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common: asthenia \n1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally \nassociated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical \ntrials or the tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program.  The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and \nthe expanded access program (n = 7,319). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: \nRenal impairment \nAs Viread may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8 Summary of the safety profile).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after \ntenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did \nnot completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of renal \nimpairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients \nreceiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete \nrecovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \nLactic acidosis \nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with \nother antiretrovirals.  Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver \ndisease, or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased \nrisk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal \noutcomes. \n \nHIV-1: \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nHepatitis B: \nExacerbations of hepatitis during treatment \nIn studies with nucleoside-naïve patients, on-treatment ALT elevations > 10 times ULN (upper limit \nof normal) and > 2 times baseline occurred in 2.6% of tenofovir disoproxil-treated patients.  ALT \nelevations had a median time to onset of 8 weeks, resolved with continued treatment, and, in a \n\n\n\n24 \n\nmajority of cases, were associated with a ≥ 2 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load that preceded or \ncoincided with the ALT elevation.  Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HBV infected patients, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred \nafter discontinuation of HBV therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1 \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomised trials (studies GS-US-104-0321 and \nGS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 years) who received \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1).  The adverse reactions observed in paediatric \npatients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those observed in \nclinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary of adverse \nreactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected adolescents, the \nBMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed \nin subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects \nwho switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on \ntheir stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \n(median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse \nevents.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings clinically consistent with proximal renal \ntubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil therapy.  Seven patients had estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Among them, 3 patients \nexperienced a clinically meaningful decline in estimated GFR which improved after discontinuation of \ntenofovir disoproxil. \n \nChronic hepatitis B \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on a randomised study (Study GS-US-174-0115) in \n106 adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B receiving treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks and on a randomised study \n(Study GS-US-174-0144) in 89 patients with chronic hepatitis B (2 to  < 12 years of age) receiving \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) for 48 weeks.  The adverse reactions \nobserved in paediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with \nthose observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary \nof adverse reactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been observed in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age.  \nThe BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those \nobserved in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nOther special population(s) \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HIV infected patients co-infected with HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatitis have \noccurred after discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see sections 4.8 and 5.3), \nand standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \nManagement \nTenofovir can be removed by haemodialysis; the median haemodialysis clearance of tenofovir is \n134 ml/min.  It is not known whether tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AF07 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate is the fumarate salt of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil.  Tenofovir \ndisoproxil is absorbed and converted to the active substance tenofovir, which is a nucleoside \nmonophosphate (nucleotide) analogue.  Tenofovir is then converted to the active metabolite, tenofovir \ndiphosphate, an obligate chain terminator, by constitutively expressed cellular enzymes.  Tenofovir \ndiphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in activated and 50 hours in resting peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and \nthe HBV polymerase by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate \nand, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination.  Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak \ninhibitor of cellular polymerases α, β, and γ.  At concentrations of up to 300 µmol/l, tenofovir has also \nshown no effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or the production of lactic acid in in vitro \nassays. \n \nData pertaining to HIV \nHIV antiviral activity in vitro: The concentration of tenofovir required for 50% inhibition (EC50) of the \nwild-type laboratory strain HIV-1IIIB is 1-6 µmol/l in lymphoid cell lines and 1.1 µmol/l against \nprimary HIV-1 subtype B isolates in PBMCs.  Tenofovir is also active against HIV-1 subtypes A, C, \nD, E, F, G, and O and against HIVBaL in primary monocyte/macrophage cells.  Tenofovir shows \nactivity in vitro against HIV-2, with an EC50 of 4.9 µmol/l in MT-4 cells. \n \nResistance: Strains of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir and a K65R mutation in reverse \ntranscriptase have been selected in vitro and in some patients (see Clinical efficacy and safety).  \nTenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with strains harbouring \nthe K65R mutation (see section 4.4).  In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase \nhas been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. \n \nClinical studies in treatment-experienced patients have assessed the anti-HIV activity of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg against strains of HIV-1 with resistance to nucleoside inhibitors.  The results \nindicate that patients whose HIV expressed 3 or more thymidine-analogue associated mutations \n(TAMs) that included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced \nresponse to tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg therapy. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n26 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe effects of tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults \nhave been demonstrated in trials of 48 weeks and 144 weeks duration, respectively. \n \nIn study GS-99-907, 550 treatment-experienced adult patients were treated with placebo or tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg for 24 weeks.  The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 427 cells/mm3, the mean \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 3.4 log10 copies/ml (78% of patients had a viral load of \n< 5,000 copies/ml) and the mean duration of prior HIV treatment was 5.4 years.  Baseline genotypic \nanalysis of HIV isolates from 253 patients revealed that 94% of patients had HIV-1 resistance \nmutations associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 58% had mutations associated \nwith protease inhibitors and 48% had mutations associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. \n \nAt week 24 the time-weighted average change from baseline in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \n(DAVG24) was -0.03 log10 copies/ml and -0.61 log10 copies/ml for the placebo and tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg recipients (p < 0.0001).  A statistically significant difference in favour of tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg was seen in the time-weighted average change from baseline at week 24 (DAVG24) for CD4 \ncount (+13 cells/mm3 for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus -11 cells/mm3 for placebo, \np-value = 0.0008).  The antiviral response to tenofovir disoproxil was durable through 48 weeks \n(DAVG48 was -0.57 log10 copies/ml, proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 or \n50 copies/ml was 41% and 18% respectively).  Eight (2%) tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg treated patients \ndeveloped the K65R mutation within the first 48 weeks. \n \nThe 144-week, double-blind, active controlled phase of study GS-99-903 evaluated the efficacy and \nsafety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus stavudine when used in combination with lamivudine and \nefavirenz in HIV-1 infected adult patients naïve to antiretroviral therapy.  The mean baseline CD4 cell \ncount was 279 cells/mm3, the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.91 log10 copies/ml, 19% of \npatients had symptomatic HIV-1 infection and 18% had AIDS.  Patients were stratified by baseline \nHIV-1 RNA and CD4 count.  Forty-three percent of patients had baseline viral loads \n> 100,000 copies/ml and 39% had CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/ml. \n \nBy intent to treat analysis (missing data and switch in antiretroviral therapy (ART) considered as \nfailure), the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml at \n48 weeks of treatment was 80% and 76% respectively in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mgarm, \ncompared to 84% and 80% in the stavudine arm.  At 144 weeks, the proportion of patients with \nHIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml was 71% and 68% respectively in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mgarm, compared to 64% and 63% in the stavudine arm. \n \nThe average change from baseline for HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count at 48 weeks of treatment was \nsimilar in both treatment groups (-3.09 and -3.09 log10 copies/ml; +169 and 167 cells/mm3 in the \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mgand stavudine groups, respectively).  At 144 weeks of treatment, the \naverage change from baseline remained similar in both treatment groups (-3.07 and \n-3.03 log10 copies/ml; +263 and +283 cells/mm3 in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mgand stavudine \ngroups, respectively).  A consistent response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mgwas seen \nregardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count. \n \nThe K65R mutation occurred in a slightly higher percentage of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than the active control group (2.7% versus 0.7%).  Efavirenz or lamivudine resistance either \npreceded or was coincident with the development of K65R in all cases.  Eight patients had HIV that \nexpressed K65R in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, 7 of these occurred during the first 48 weeks \nof treatment and the last one at week 96.  No further K65R development was observed up to \nweek 144.  One patient in the tenofovir disoproxil arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus.  \nFrom both the genotypic and phenotypic analyses there was no evidence for other pathways of \nresistance to tenofovir. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nData pertaining to HBV \n HBV antiviral activity in vitro: The in vitro antiviral activity of tenofovir against HBV was assessed \nin the HepG2 2.2.15 cell line.  The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.14 to 1.5 µmol/l, \nwith CC50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) values > 100 µmol/l. \n \nResistance: No HBV mutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil resistance have been identified \n(see Clinical efficacy and safety).  In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, \nrtL180M, and rtM204I/V mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine showed a \nsusceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild-type virus.  HBV strains \nexpressing the rtL180M, rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V and rtM250V mutations associated with \nresistance to entecavir showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of wild-\ntype virus.  HBV strains expressing the adefovir-associated resistance mutations rtA181V and \nrtN236T showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild-type virus.  \nViruses containing the rtA181T mutation remained susceptible to tenofovir with EC50 values 1.5-fold \nthat of wild-type virus. \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe demonstration of benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in compensated and decompensated disease is \nbased on virological, biochemical and serological responses in adults with HBeAg positive and \nHBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B.  Treated patients included those who were treatment-naïve, \nlamivudine-experienced, adefovir dipivoxil-experienced and patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir \ndipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  Benefit has also been demonstrated based on histological \nresponses in compensated patients. \n \nExperience in patients with compensated liver disease at 48 weeks (studies GS-US-174-0102 and \nGS-US-174-0103) \nResults through 48 weeks from two randomised, phase 3 double-blind studies comparing tenofovir \ndisoproxil to adefovir dipivoxil in adult patients with compensated liver disease are presented in \nTable 3 below.  Study GS-US-174-0103 was conducted in 266 (randomised and treated) \nHBeAg positive patients while study GS-US-174-0102 was conducted in 375 (randomised and treated) \npatients negative for HBeAg and positive for HBeAb. \n \nIn both of these studies tenofovir disoproxil was significantly superior to adefovir dipivoxil for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint of complete response (defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis).  Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was also associated with significantly greater \nproportions of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, when compared to adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg \ntreatment.  Both treatments produced similar results with regard to histological response (defined as \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis) at week 48 (see Table 3 below). \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0103 a significantly greater proportion of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than in the adefovir dipivoxil group had normalised ALT and achieved HBsAg loss at week 48 \n(see Table 3 below). \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nTable 3: Efficacy parameters in compensated HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients at \nweek 48 \n \n Study 174-0102 (HBeAg negative) Study 174-0103 (HBeAg positive) \nParameter Tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg  \nn = 250 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \n\nn = 125 \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg  \n\nn = 176 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \nn = 90 \n\nComplete \nresponse (%)a \n\n71* 49 67* 12 \n\nHistology     \nHistological response \n(%)b \n\n72 \n \n\n69 74 68 \n\nMedian HBV DNA \nreduction from \nbaselinec \n(log10 copies/ml) \n\n-4.7* -4.0 -6.4* -3.7 \n\nHBV DNA (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \n(< 69 IU/ml) \n\n \n93* \n\n \n63 \n\n \n76* \n\n \n13 \n\nALT (%) \nNormalised ALTd \n\n \n76 \n\n \n77 \n\n \n68* \n\n \n54 \n\nSerology (%) \nHBeAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n \nn/a \n\n \nn/a \n\n \n22/21 \n\n \n18/18 \n\nHBsAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n0/0 0/0 3*/1 0/0 \n\n* p-value versus adefovir dipivoxil < 0.05. \na Complete response defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at \nleast 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nb Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nc Median change from baseline HBV DNA merely reflects the difference between baseline HBV DNA and the limit of \ndetection (LOD) of the assay. \nd The population used for analysis of ALT normalisation included only patients with ALT above ULN at baseline. \nn/a = not applicable. \n \nTenofovir disoproxil was associated with significantly greater proportions of patients with \nundetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche Cobas \nTaqman HBV assay), when compared to adefovir dipivoxil (study GS-US-174-0102; 91%, 56% and \nstudy GS-US-174-0103; 69%, 9%), respectively. \n \nResponse to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleoside-experienced (n = 51) \nand nucleoside-naïve (n = 375) patients and in patients with normal ALT (n = 21) and abnormal ALT \n(n = 405) at baseline when studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were combined.  \nForty-nine of the 51 nucleoside-experienced patients were previously treated with lamivudine.  \nSeventy-three percent of nucleoside-experienced and 69% of nucleoside-naïve patients achieved \ncomplete response to treatment; 90% of nucleoside-experienced and 88% of nucleoside-naïve patients \nachieved HBV DNA suppression < 400 copies/ml.

Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  was associated \nwith a mean change in serum HBV DNA from baseline, in the patients for whom there was 48-week \ndata, of -5.74 log10 copies/ml (n = 18).  In addition, 61% of patients had normal ALT at week 48. \n \nExperience in patients with persistent viral replication (study GS-US-174-0106) \nThe efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  plus 200 mg \nemtricitabine has been evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study (study GS-US-174-0106), in \nHBeAg positive and HBeAg negative adult patients who had persistent viraemia \n(HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 copies/ml) while receiving adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg for more than 24 weeks.  At \nbaseline, 57% of patients randomised to tenofovir disoproxil versus 60% of patients randomised to \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment group had previously been treated with lamivudine.  \nOverall at week 24, treatment with tenofovir disoproxil resulted in 66% (35/53) of patients with \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (< 69 IU/ml) versus 69% (36/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.672).  In addition 55% (29/53) of patients treated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil had undetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of \nthe Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV assay) versus 60% (31/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.504).  Comparisons between treatment groups beyond week 24 are difficult \n\n\n\n31 \n\nto interpret since investigators had the option to intensify treatment to open-label emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil.  Long-term studies to evaluate the benefit/risk of bitherapy with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil in HBV monoinfected patients are ongoing. \n \nExperience in patients with decompensated liver disease at 48 weeks (study GS-US-174-0108) \nStudy GS-US-174-0108 is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled study evaluating the safety \nand efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), and \nentecavir (n = 22), in patients with decompensated liver disease.  In the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \narm, patients had a mean CPT score of 7.2, mean HBV DNA of 5.8 log10 copies/ml and mean serum \nALT of 61 U/l at baseline.  Forty-two percent (19/45) of patients had at least 6 months of prior \nlamivudine experience, 20% (9/45) of patients had prior adefovir dipivoxil experience and 9 of \n45 patients (20%) had lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  The \nco-primary safety endpoints were discontinuation due to an adverse event and confirmed increase in \nserum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nIn patients with CPT scores ≤ 9, 74% (29/39) of tenofovir disoproxil, and 94% (33/35) of \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment groups achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml after \n48 weeks of treatment. \n \nOverall, the data derived from this study are too limited to draw any definitive conclusions on the \ncomparison of emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil versus tenofovir disoproxil, (see Table 7 below). \n \nTable 7: Safety and efficacy parameters in decompensated patients at week 48 \n \n Study 174-0108 \nParameter Tenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEmtricitabine 200 mg/ \ntenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEntecavir \n(0.5 mg or 1 mg) \n\nn = 22 \n\nTolerability failure \n(permanent \ndiscontinuation of study \ndrug due to a treatment \nemergent AE) \nn (%)a \n\n3 (7%) 2 (4%) 2 (9%) \n\nConfirmed increase in \nserum creatinine \n≥ 0.5 mg/dl from \nbaseline or confirmed \nserum phosphate of \n< 2 mg/dl \nn (%)b \n\n4 (9%) 3 (7%) 1 (5%) \n\nHBV DNA n (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \nn (%) \n\n31/44 (70%) 36/41 (88%) 16/22 (73%) \n\nALT n (%) \nNormal ALT \n\n25/44 (57%) 31/41 (76%) 12/22 (55%) \n\n≥ 2 point decrease in \nCPT from baseline \nn (%) \n\n7/27 (26%) 12/25 (48%) 5/12 (42%) \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in CPT score \n\n-0.8 -0.9 -1.3 \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in MELD score \n\n-1.8 -2.3 -2.6 \n\na p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 0.622, \nb p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 1.000. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nExperience beyond 48 weeks in study GS-US-174-0108 \nUsing a noncompleter/switch = failure analysis, 50% (21/42) of subjects receiving tenofovir \ndisoproxil, 76% (28/37) of subjects receiving emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil and 52% (11/21) \nof subjects receiving entecavir achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 168. \n \nExperience in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV at 240 weeks (study GS-US-174-0121) \nThe efficacy and safety of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind \nstudy (GS-US-174-0121) in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n = 280) with \ncompensated liver disease, viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 IU/ml), and genotypic evidence of \nlamivudine resistance (rtM204I/V +/- rtL180M).  Only five had adefovir-associated resistance \nmutations at baseline.  One hundred forty-one and 139 adult subjects were randomised to a tenofovir \ndisoproxil and emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, respectively.  Baseline \ndemographics were similar between the two treatment arms: At baseline, 52.5% of subjects were \nHBeAg negative, 47.5% were HBeAg positive, mean HBV DNA level was 6.5 log10 copies/ml, and \nmean ALT was 79 U/l, respectively. \n \nAfter 240 weeks of treatment, 117 of 141 subjects (83%) randomised to tenofovir disoproxil had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 51 of 79 subjects (65%) had ALT normalisation.  After 240 weeks of \ntreatment with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 115 of 139 subjects (83%) had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 59 of 83 subjects (71%) had ALT normalisation.  Among the \nHBeAg positive subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil, 16 of 65 subjects (25%) experienced \nHBeAg loss, and 8 of 65 subjects (12%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through week 240.

Genotypic data \nfrom paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 6/8 patients with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified in these isolates.  Genotypic analysis was conducted for 5 subjects in the \ntenofovir disoproxil arm post week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil resistance were detected in any subject. \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0121, 141 patients with lamivudine resistance substitutions at baseline received \ntenofovir disoproxil for up to 240 weeks.  Cumulatively, there were 4 patients who experienced a \nviremic episode (HBV DNA>400 copies/ml) at their last timepoint on TDF.  Among them, sequence \n\n\n\n33 \n\ndata from paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 2 of 4 patients.  No amino \nacid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0115), 52 patients (including 6 patients with lamivudine resistance \nmutations at baseline) initially received blinded tenofovir disoproxil for up to 72 weeks and then \n51/52 patients switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil (TDF-TDF group).  Genotypic evaluations \nwere performed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 6), \nweek 72 (n = 5), week 96 (n = 4), week 144 (n = 2), and week 192 (n = 3).  Fifty-four patients \n(including 2 patients with lamivudine resistance mutations at baseline) initially received blinded \nplacebo treatment for 72 weeks, and 52/54 patients followed with tenofovir disoproxil (PLB-TDF \ngroup).  Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 96 (n = 17), week 144 (n = 7), and week 192 (n = 8).  No amino acid \nsubstitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0144), genotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV \nisolates from patients who received tenofovir disoproxil were available for 9 of 10 patients who had \nplasma HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml. No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to \ntenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates by week 48. \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years \nof age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an \noptimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of \ntenofovir disoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at \nweek 24.  However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult \ndata and comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine \nBMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, \nrespectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and \n-0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the \ntenofovir disoproxil and placebo groups, respectively.  The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group compared to the placebo group.  At week 48, six adolescents in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group and one adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD \nloss (defined as > 4% loss).  Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil, BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, \nvirologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either \nreplace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original \nregimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.  At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA \nconcentrations < 400 copies/ml.  The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained \n< 400 copies/ml at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group.  When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment \ngroup had HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/ml at week 48. \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In patients who received treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and \n-0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean \nchanges at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, \nand -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or \nzidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar \nbetween the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  \nTotal body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine \nor zidovudine treatment group.  One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or \n\n\n\n34 \n\nzidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  \nBMD Z-scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who \nwere treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks.  BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and \nweight. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \ndiscontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings \nclinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil \ntherapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). \n \nChronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients \naged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, elevated serum ALT \n(≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 months] were treated with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks.  Subjects must have been naïve \nto tenofovir disoproxil, but could have received interferon based regimens (> 6 months prior to \nscreening) or any other non-tenofovir disoproxil containing oral anti-HBV nucleoside/nucleotide \ntherapy (> 16 weeks prior to screening).  At week 72, overall 88% (46/52) of patients in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment group and 0% (0/54) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-four percent (26/35) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had \nnormalised ALT at week 72 compared to 31% (13/42) in the placebo group.  Response to treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleos(t)ide-naïve (n = 20) and nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced (n = 32) patients, including lamivudine-resistant patients (n = 6).  Ninety-five percent of \nnucleos(t)ide-naïve patients, 84% of nucleos(t)ide-experienced patients, and 83% of lamivudine-\nresistant patients achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 72.  Thirty-one of the 32 nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced patients had prior lamivudine experience.  At week 72, 96% (27/28) of immune-active \npatients (HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, serum ALT > 1.5 x ULN) in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 0% (0/32) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-five \npercent (21/28) of immune-active patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normal ALT at \nweek 72 compared to 34% (11/32) in the placebo group. \n \nAfter 72 weeks of blinded randomized treatment, each subject could switch to open-label tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment up to week 192.  After week 72, virologic suppression was maintained for those \nreceiving double-blind tenofovir disoproxil followed by open-label tenofovir disoproxil (TDF-TDF \ngroup): 86.5% (45/52) of subjects in the TDF-TDF group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at \nweek 192.  Among the subjects who received placebo during the double-blind period, the proportion \nof subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL rose sharply after they began treatment with open-label \nTDF (PLB-TDF group): 74.1% (40/54) of subjects in the PLB-TDF group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml at week 192.  The proportion of subjects with ALT normalization at week 192 in the \nTDF-TDF group was 75.8% (25/33) among those who were HBeAg positive at baseline and 100.0% \n(2 of 2 subjects) among those who were HBeAg negative at baseline.  Similar percentages of subjects \nin the TDF-TDF and PLB-TDF groups (37.5% and 41.7%, respectively) experienced seroconversion \nto anti-HBe through week 192. \n \nBone Mineral Density (BMD) data from Study GS-US-174-0115 are summarized in Table 8: \n \nTable 8: Bone Mineral Density Evaluation at Baseline, Week 72 and 192 \n \n\n Baseline Week 72 Week 192 TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF \nLumbar spine mean \n(SD) BMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.42  \n(0.762) \n\n-0.26  \n(0.806) \n\n-0.49  \n(0.852)  \n\n-0.23 \n(0.893)  \n\n-0.37 \n(0.946)  \n\n-0.44 \n(0.920)  \n\nLumbar spine mean \n(SD) change from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA -0.06  (0.320) \n0.10  \n\n(0.378) \n0.02  \n\n(0.548) \n-0.10 \n\n(0.543) \n\nWhole body mean \n(SD) BMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.19  \n(1.110) \n\n−0.23 \n(0.859) \n\n−0.36 \n (1.077) \n\n−0.12 \n(0.916) \n\n−0.38 \n(0.934) \n\n−0.42 \n (0.942) \n\nWhole body mean NA NA −0.16 0.09 -0.16 -0.19  \n\n\n\n35 \n\n Baseline Week 72 Week 192 TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF \n(SD) change from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\n(0.355) (0.349) (0.521) (0.504) \n\nLumbar spine BMD at \nleast 6% decreaseb NA NA \n\n1.9% \n(1 subject) 0% \n\n3.8% \n(2 subjects) \n\n3.7% \n(2 subjects) \n\nWhole body BMD at \nleast 6% decreaseb NA NA 0% 0% 0% \n\n1.9% \n(1 subject) \n\nLumbar spine BMD \nmean % increase NA NA 5.14% 8.08% 10.05% 11.21% \n\nWhole body BMD \nmean % increase NA NA 3.07% 5.39% 6.09% 7.22% \n\nNA = Not Applicable \na BMD Z-scores not adjusted for height and weight \nb Primary safety endpoint through week 72 \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0144, 89 HBeAg-negative and -positive patients aged 2 to < 12 years with \nchronic hepatitis B were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 245 mg \n(n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) once daily for 48 weeks. Subjects must have been naïve to tenofovir \ndisoproxil, with HBV DNA > 105 copies/mL (~ 4.2 log10 IU/mL) and ALT >1.5 × the upper \nlimit of normal (ULN) at screening. At week 48, 77% (46 of 60) of patients in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment group and 7% (2 of 29) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL). Sixty-six percent (38 of 58) of patients in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil group had normalized ALT at week 48 compared with 15% (4 of 27) in the placebo \ngroup.  Twenty-five percent (14 of 56) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group and 24% (7 of 29) \nof patients in the placebo group achieved HBeAg seroconversion at Week 48.Response to treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects with \n76% (38/50) of treatment-naïve and 80% (8/10) of treatment-experienced subjects achieving HBV \nDNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/ml) at Week 48. Response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was \nalso similar in subjects who were HBeAg-negative compared with those who were HBeAg-positive at \nbaseline with 77% (43/56) HBeAg-positive and 75.0% (3/4) HBeAg-negative subjects achieving HBV \nDNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL) at Week 48. The distribution of HBV genotypes at baseline was \nsimilar between the TDF and Placebo groups. The majority of subjects were either genotypes C \n(43.8%) or D (41.6%) with a lower and similar frequency of genotypes A and B (6.7% each). Only 1 \nsubject randomized to the TDF group was genotype E at baseline. In general, treatment responses to \ntenofovir disoproxil were similar for genotypes A, B, C and E [75-100% of subjects achieved HBV \nDNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL) at Week 48] with a lower response rate in subjects with genotype \nD infection (55%). \n\nBone Mineral Density (BMD) data from Study GS-US-174-0144 are summarized in Table 9: \n\n \nTable 9: Bone Mineral Density Evaluation at Baseline and Week 48 \n \n\n Baseline Week 48 TDF PLB TDF PLB \nLumbar spine mean \n(SD) BMD Z-scorea \n\n0.02  \n(0.977) \n\n-0.29  \n(1.229) \n\n-0.11 \n(0.983) \n\n-0.11 \n(1.234) \n\nLumbar spine mean \n(SD) change from \nbaseline BMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA -0.12  (0.411) \n0.14 \n\n(0.330) \n\nWhole body mean (SD) \nBMD Z-scorea \n\n0.11 \n(0.743) \n\n−0.05 \n(1.497) \n\n-0.34 \n(0.939) \n\n0.20 \n(1.299) \n\nWhole body mean (SD) \nchange from baseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA −0.18 (0.334) \n0.22 \n\n(0.446) \n\nLumbar spine BMD at NA NA 18.3% 6.9% \n\n\n\n36 \n\n Baseline Week 48 TDF PLB TDF PLB \nleast 4% decreaseb (11 subjects) (2 subjects) \nWhole body BMD at \nleast 4% decrease NA NA \n\n6.7% \n(4 subjects) 0% \n\nLumbar spine BMD \nmean % increaseb NA NA 3.8% 7.6% \n\nWhole body BMD mean \n% increase NA NA 4.5% 8.9% \n\nNA = Not Applicable \na BMD Z-scores only available for a limited set of subjects with matched reference data \nb Secondary endpoint through week 48 \n \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nViread in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in HIV and chronic hepatitis B (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTenofovir disoproxil is a water soluble ester prodrug which is rapidly converted in vivo to tenofovir \nand formaldehyde. \n \nTenofovir is converted intracellularly to tenofovir monophosphate and to the active component, \ntenofovir diphosphate. \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil to HIV infected patients, tenofovir disoproxil is \nrapidly absorbed and converted to tenofovir.  Administration of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil \nwith a meal to HIV infected patients resulted in mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values of \n326 (36.6%) ng/ml, 3,324 (41.2%) ng·h/ml and 64.4 (39.4%) ng/ml, respectively.  Maximum tenofovir \nconcentrations are observed in serum within one hour of dosing in the fasted state and within two \nhours when taken with food.  The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted \npatients was approximately 25%.  Administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a high fat meal \nenhanced the oral bioavailability, with an increase in tenofovir AUC by approximately 40% and Cmax \nby approximately 14%.  Following the first dose of tenofovir disoproxil in fed patients, the median \nCmax in serum ranged from 213 to 375 ng/ml.  However, administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a \nlight meal did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration the steady-state volume of distribution of tenofovir was \nestimated to be approximately 800 ml/kg.  After oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir \nis distributed to most tissues with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidney, liver and the \nintestinal contents (preclinical studies).  In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum \nprotein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to \n25 µg/ml. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the \nCYP450 enzymes.  Moreover, at concentrations substantially higher (approximately 300-fold) than \nthose observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major \nhuman CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2E1, or CYP1A1/2).  Tenofovir disoproxil at a concentration of 100 µmol/l had no effect on any \nof the CYP450 isoforms, except CYP1A1/2, where a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction \nin metabolism of CYP1A1/2 substrate was observed.  Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically \nsignificant interactions involving tenofovir disoproxil and medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 \nwould occur. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nElimination \nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system \nwith approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous \nadministration.  Total clearance has been estimated to be approximately 230 ml/h/kg (approximately \n300 ml/min).  Renal clearance has been estimated to be approximately 160 ml/h/kg (approximately \n210 ml/min), which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.  This indicates that active tubular \nsecretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir.  Following oral administration the \nterminal half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. \n \nStudies have established the pathway of active tubular secretion of tenofovir to be influx into proximal \ntubule cell by the human organic anion transporters (hOAT) 1 and 3 and efflux into the urine by the \nmultidrug resistant protein 4 (MRP 4). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were independent of tenofovir disoproxil dose over the dose range \n75 to 600 mg and were not affected by repeated dosing at any dose level. \n \nGender \nLimited data on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in women indicate no major gender effect. \n \nEthnicity \nPharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in different ethnic groups. \n \nPaediatric population \nSteady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 8 HIV-1 infected adolescent patients \n(aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg and in 23 HIV-1 infected children aged \n2 to < 12 years (see Table 10 below).  Tenofovir exposure achieved in these paediatric patients \nreceiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or 6.5 mg/kg body weight tenofovir \ndisoproxil up to a maximum dose of 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving \nonce-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n \nTable 10: Mean (± SD) tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters by age groups for paediatric \npatients \n \n\nDose and formulation 245 mg film-coated tablet \n12 to < 18 years (n = 8) \n\n6.5 mg/kg granules \n2 to < 12 years (n = 23) \n\nCmax (μg/ml) 0.38 ± 0.13 0.24 ± 0.13 \nAUCtau (μg·h/ml) 3.39 ± 1.22 2.59 ± 1.06 \n\n \nChronic hepatitis B: Steady-state tenofovir exposure in HBV infected adolescent patients \n(12 to < 18 years of age) receiving an oral daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was similar to \nexposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n \nTenofovir exposure in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age receiving an oral daily \ndose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg of body weight (tablet or granules) up to a maximum dose of \n245 mg  was similar to exposures achieved in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age \nreceiving a once daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in children under 2 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose of \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult patients with varying degrees of \nrenal impairment defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function \nwhen CrCl > 80 ml/min; mild with CrCl = 50-79 ml/min; moderate with CrCl = 30-49 ml/min and \nsevere with CrCl = 10-29 ml/min).  Compared with patients with normal renal function, the mean \n\n\n\n38 \n\n(%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng·h/ml in subjects with CrCl > 80 ml/min to \nrespectively 3,064 (30%) ng·h/ml, 6,009 (42%) ng·h/ml and 15,985 (45%) ng·h/ml in patients with \nmild, moderate and severe renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in non-haemodialysis adult patients with creatinine clearance \n< 10 ml/min and in patients with ESRD managed by peritoneal or other forms of dialysis have not \nbeen studied. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in paediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied.  \nNo data are available to make dose recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV, non-HBV  infected adult \npatients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) \nclassification.  Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic \nimpairment suggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects.  The mean (%CV) \ntenofovir Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/ml and 2,050 (50.8%) ng·h/ml, respectively, \nin normal subjects compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/ml and 2,310 (43.5%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/ml and 2,740 (44.0%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment. \n \nIntracellular pharmacokinetics \nIn non-proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the half-life of tenofovir \ndiphosphate was found to be approximately 50 hours, whereas the half-life in phytohaemagglutinin-\nstimulated PBMCs was found to be approximately 10 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety pharmacology studies reveal no special hazard for humans.  Findings in repeated \ndose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical \nexposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a \ndecrease in serum phosphate concentration.  Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) \nand reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs).  The bone toxicity in young adult rats and \ndogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred \nin juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the \nexposure in patients).  Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-\nrelated decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in BMD. \n \nGenotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results \nin one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat \nhepatocytes.  However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n \nOral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an \nextremely high dose in mice.  These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. \n \nReproductive studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal \nparameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in peri-\npostnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \nThe active substance tenofovir disoproxil and its main transformation products are persistent in the \nenvironment. \n \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nViread 163 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 163 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate). \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach tablet contains 109 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nWhite, round-shaped, film-coated tablets, 10.7 mm in diameter, debossed on one side with “GSI” and \non the other side with “200”. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHIV-1 infection \nViread 163 mg film-coated tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts for the treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, with NRTI resistance or toxicities \nprecluding the use of first line agents, aged 6 to < 12 years who weigh from 22 kg to less than 28 kg. \n \nThe choice of Viread to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be based \non individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. \n \nHepatitis B infection \nViread 163 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in paediatric \npatients aged 6 to < 12 years who weigh from 22 kg to less than 28 kg, with: \n \n• compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication \n\nand persistently elevated serum ALT levels, or histological evidence of moderate to severe \ninflammation and/or fibrosis.  With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in paediatric \npatients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection and/or \ntreatment of chronic hepatitis B. \n \nPosology \n \nHIV-1 and Chronic hepatitis B \nThe recommended dose for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in paediatric \npatients aged 6 to < 12 years weighing 22 kg to < 28 kg who are able to swallow film-coated tablets is \none 163 mg tablet once daily taken orally with food. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nPlease refer to the Summaries of Product Characteristics for Viread 123 mg and 204 mg film-coated \ntablets for the treatment of HIV-1 infect ion and chronic hepatitis B in paediatric patients aged \n6 to < 12 years weighing 17 kg to < 22 kg and 28 kg to < 35 kg, respectively. \n \nViread is also available as 33 mg/g granules for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis \nB in paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years who weigh < 17 kg or who are unable to swallow \nfilm-coated tablets.  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Viread 33 mg/g \ngranules. \n \nThe decision to treat paediatric patients should be based on careful consideration of individual patient \nneeds and with reference to current paediatric treatment guidelines including the value of baseline \nhistological information.  The benefits of long-term virologic suppression with continued therapy must \nbe weighed against the risk of prolonged treatment, including the emergence of resistant hepatitis B \nvirus and the uncertainties as regards the long term impact of bone and renal toxicity (see section 4.4). \n \nSerum ALT should be persistently elevated for at least 6 months prior to treatment of paediatric \npatients with compensated liver disease due to HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B; and for at least 12 \nmonths in patients with HBeAg negative disease. \n \nDuration of therapy in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis B \n \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown.  Treatment discontinuation may be considered as \nfollows: \n \n- In HBeAg positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least \n\n12 months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe detection \non two consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) is confirmed or until \nHBs seroconversion or there is loss of efficacy (see section 4.4).  Serum ALT and HBV DNA \nlevels should be followed regularly after treatment discontinuation to detect any late virological \nrelapse. \n\n \n- In HBeAg negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until \n\nHBs seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy.  Treatment discontinuation may \nalso be considered after stable virological suppression is achieved (i.e. for at least 3 years) \nprovided serum ALT and HBV DNA levels are followed regularly after treatment \ndiscontinuation to detect any late virological relapse.  With prolonged treatment for more than \n2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected therapy \nremains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \nMissed dose \nIf a patient misses a dose of Viread within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Viread with food as soon as possible and resume their normal dosing schedule.  If a patient \nmisses a dose of Viread by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for their next dose, the patient \nshould not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Viread, another tablet should be taken.  If the patient \nvomits more than 1 hour after taking Viread they do not need to take another dose. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nIf Viread 163 mg film-coated tablets are discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B \nvirus (HBV), these patients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected children or children with \nchronic hepatitis B under 2 years of age have not been established.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nViread 163 mg film-coated tablets should be taken once daily, orally with food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nHIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV infected patients before initiating tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy (see below Co-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B). \n \nHIV-1 \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nHepatitis B \nPatients must be advised that tenofovir disoproxil has not been proven to prevent the risk of \ntransmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.  Appropriate \nprecautions must continue to be used. \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \n\ntenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n- Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see Section 4.5).   \n \nTriple therapy with nucleosides/nucleotides \nThere have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early \nstage in HIV patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well \nas with lamivudine and didanosine as a once-daily regimen. \n \nRenal and bone effects in adult population \nRenal effects \nTenofovir is principally eliminated via the kidney.  Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated \ncreatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been \nreported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil in clinical practice (see section 4.8). \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal safety with tenofovir has only been studied to a very limited degree in adult patients with \nimpaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min). \n \nBone effects \nIn HIV infected patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil \nwith stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve adult patients, \nsmall decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment \ngroups.  Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly \n\n\n\n44 \n\ngreater in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks.  Decreases in BMD of hip were \nsignificantly greater in this group until 96 weeks.  However, there was no increased risk of fractures or \nevidence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks. \n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen \nin patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \ninhibitor.  Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are \nat a high risk for fractures. \n \nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \ntubulopathy (see section 4.8). \n \nRenal and bone effects in paediatric population \nThere are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity.  Moreover, the \nreversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is \nrecommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide \nthe appropriate monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and \nconsider the need for supplementation. \n \nRenal effects \nRenal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in \nHIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nRenal monitoring \nIt is recommended that renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) is assessed in all \npatients prior to initiating therapy with tenofovir disoproxil and that it is also monitored after two to \nfour weeks of treatment, after three months of treatment and every three to six months thereafter in \npatients without renal risk factors.  In patients at risk for renal impairment, a more frequent monitoring \nof renal function is required. \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving \ntenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements \nof blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal \ntubulopathy).  If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist \nshould be obtained to consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil treatment.  Interrupting treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function \nwhen no other cause has been identified. \n \nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, \nvancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2).  If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil and nephrotoxic \nagents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. \n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors \nfor renal dysfunction.  If tenofovir disoproxil is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should \nbe monitored adequately. \n \nA higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil in \ncombination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor.  A close monitoring of renal \nfunction is required in these patients (see section 4.5).  In patients with renal risk factors, the \nco-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully \nevaluated. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nTenofovir disoproxil has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which \nare secreted by the same renal pathway, including the transport proteins human organic anion \ntransporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product).  These \nrenal transport proteins may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of \ntenofovir and cidofovir.  Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products, which are \nsecreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 or MRP 4, might be \nmodified if they are co-administered.  Unless clearly necessary, concomitant use of these medicinal \nproducts which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not recommended, but if such use is \nunavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2).  Tenofovir disoproxil should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal impairment \nand should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy. \n \nBone effects \nViread may cause a reduction in BMD.  The effects of tenofovir disoproxil-associated changes in \nBMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown (see section 5.1). \n \nIf bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with an \nendocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. \n \nLiver disease \nTenofovir and tenofovir disoproxil are not metabolised by liver enzymes.  A pharmacokinetic study \nhas been performed in non-HIV infected adult patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment.  \nNo significant pharmacokinetic alteration has been observed in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis \nFlares on treatment: Spontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are \ncharacterised by transient increases in serum ALT.  After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may \nincrease in some patients (see section 4.8).  In patients with compensated liver disease, these increases \nin serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or \nhepatic decompensation.  Patients with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation \nfollowing hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. \n \nFlares after treatment discontinuation: Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been reported in \npatients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy.  Post-treatment exacerbations are usually \nassociated with rising HBV DNA, and the majority appears to be self-limited.  However, severe \nexacerbations, including fatalities, have been reported.  Hepatic function should be monitored at \nrepeated intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after \ndiscontinuation of hepatitis B therapy.  If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be \nwarranted.  In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not \nrecommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. \n \nLiver flares are especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated liver disease. \n \nCo-infection with hepatitis C or D: There are no data on the efficacy of tenofovir in patients \nco-infected with hepatitis C or D virus. \n \nCo-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B: Due to the risk of development of HIV resistance, tenofovir \ndisoproxil should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients.  Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active \nhepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART) and should be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is \nevidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must \n\n\n\n46 \n\nbe considered.  However, it should be noted that increases of ALT can be part of HBV clearance \nduring therapy with tenofovir, see above Exacerbations of hepatitis. \n \nUse with certain hepatitis C virus antiviral agents \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, \nespecially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).  The safety of tenofovir disoproxil in the setting of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established.  The potential risks and benefits associated with \nco-administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with tenofovir disoproxil given in conjunction with a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, particularly in patients at \nincreased risk of renal dysfunction.  Patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported, particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nExcipients \n \nViread 163 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate.   Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should \nnot take this medicine. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nBased on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the \npotential for CYP450-mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir \ndisoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nDidanosine \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and \nTable 1). \n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products \nSince tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with \nmedicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport \nproteins hOAT 1, hOAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir \nand/or the co-administered medicinal products. \n \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, \nfoscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). \n \nGiven that tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when it is \nco-administered with tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nOther interactions \nInteractions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below \n(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, and once daily \nas “q.d.”). \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nTable 1: Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\n(dose in mg) \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, Cmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation \nconcerning \n\nco-administration with \n245 mg tenofovir disoproxil  \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntiretrovirals \nProtease inhibitors \nAtazanavir/Ritonavir \n(300 q.d./100 q.d.) \n\nAtazanavir: \nAUC: ↓ 25% \nCmax: ↓ 28% \nCmin: ↓ 26% \nTenofovir: \nAUC: ↑ 37% \nCmax: ↑ 34% \nCmin: ↑ 29% \n\nNo dose adjustment is \nrecommended.

Rarely, \npancreatitis and lactic \nacidosis, sometimes fatal, \nhave been reported.  \nCo-administration of \ntenofovir disoproxil and \ndidanosine at a dose of \n400 mg daily has been \nassociated with a significant \ndecrease in CD4 cell count, \npossibly due to an \nintracellular interaction \nincreasing phosphorylated \n(i.e. active) didanosine.

Animal studies do not \nindicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The use of tenofovir disoproxil may be considered \nduring pregnancy, if necessary. \n \nIn the literature, exposure to tenofovir disoproxil in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to \nreduce the risk of HBV transmission from mother to infant if tenofovir disoproxil is given to mothers, \nin addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine in infants.  \n\nIn three controlled clinical trials, a total of 327 pregnant women with chronic HBV infection were \nadministered tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg) once daily from 28 to 32 weeks gestation through 1 to 2 \nmonths postpartum; women and their infants were followed for up to 12 months after delivery.  No \nsafety signal has emerged from these data. \n\nBreast-feeding \nTenofovir has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the \neffects of tenofovir in newborns/infants.  Therefore Viread should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \nAs a general rule, it is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants in order \nto avoid transmission of HIV to the infant. \n \nFertility \nThere are limited clinical data with respect to the effect of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility.  Animal \nstudies do not indicate harmful effects of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, \npatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil, rare events of renal impairment, \nrenal failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \nsometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have been reported.  \nMonitoring of renal function is recommended for patients receiving Viread (see section 4.4). \n \nHIV-1: Approximately one third of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions following \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  These reactions \nare usually mild to moderate gastrointestinal events.  Approximately 1% of tenofovir \ndisoproxil-treated adult patients discontinued treatment due to the gastrointestinal events. \n \n \nHepatitis B: Approximately one quarter of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions \nfollowing treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, most of which are mild.  In clinical trials of \nHBV infected patients, the most frequently occurring adverse reaction to tenofovir disoproxil was \nnausea (5.4%). \n \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients on treatment as well as in patients who \nhave discontinued hepatitis B therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nHIV-1 clinical studies:  Assessment of adverse reactions for tenofovir disoproxil is based on safety \ndata from clinical studies and post-marketing experience.  All adverse reactions are presented in \nTable 2. \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on experience in two studies \nin 653 treatment-experienced adult patients receiving treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 443) or \nplacebo (n = 210) in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for 24 weeks and also in \na double-blind comparative controlled study in which 600 treatment-naïve adult patients received \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 299) or stavudine (n = 301) in combination with \nlamivudine and efavirenz for 144 weeks. \n \nHepatitis B clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HBV clinical study data is \nprimarily based on experience in two double-blind comparative controlled studies in which 641 adult \npatients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg  daily (n = 426) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily (n = 215) for 48 weeks.  The \nadverse reactions observed with continued treatment for 384 weeks were consistent with the safety \nprofile of tenofovir disoproxil.  After an initial decline of approximately -4.9 ml/min (using \nCockcroft-Gault equation) or -3.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (using modification of diet in renal disease \n[MDRD] equation) after the first 4 weeks of treatment, the rate of annual decline post baseline of renal \n\n\n\n62 \n\nfunction reported in tenofovir disoproxil treated patients was -1.41 ml/min per year (using \nCockcroft-Gault equation) and -0.74 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (using MDRD equation). \n \nPatients with decompensated liver disease: The safety profile of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with \ndecompensated liver disease was assessed in a double-blind active controlled study \n(GS-US-174-0108) in which adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or entecavir (n = 22) for 48 weeks. \n \nIn the tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse \nevent; 9% of patients experienced a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl through week 48; there were no statistically significant \ndifferences between the combined tenofovir-containing arms and the entecavir arm.  After 168 weeks, \n16% (7/45) of the tenofovir disoproxil group, 4% (2/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup, and 14% (3/22) of the entecavir group experienced tolerability failure.  Thirteen percent (6/45) \nof the tenofovir disoproxil group, 13% (6/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group, and \n9% (2/22) of the entecavir group had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nAt week 168, in this population of patients with decompensated liver disease, the rate of death was of \n13% (6/45) in the tenofovir disoproxil group, 11% (5/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup and 14% (3/22) in the entecavir group.  The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was 18% (8/45) in \nthe tenofovir disoproxil group, 7% (3/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group and 9% \n(2/22) in the entecavir group. \n \nSubjects with a high baseline CPT score were at higher risk of developing serious adverse events \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B: No new adverse reactions to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified from a randomised, double-blind study (GS-US-174-0121) in which 280 \nlamivudine-resistant patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 141) or \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (n = 139) for 240 weeks. \n \nThe adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment are listed below by \nbody system organ class and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil based on \nclinical study and post-marketing experience \n \nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common: hypophosphataemia1 \nUncommon: hypokalaemia1 \nRare: lactic acidosis \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common: dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \nCommon: flatulence \nUncommon: pancreatitis \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nCommon: increased transaminases \nRare: hepatic steatosis, hepatitis \n\n\n\n63 \n\nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common: rash \nRare: angioedema \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nUncommon: rhabdomyolysis1, muscular weakness1 \n\nRare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures)\n1, \n\n2, myopathy1 \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nUncommon: increased creatinine, proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \n\nRare: acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, nephritis (including acute interstitial nephritis)2, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common: asthenia \n1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally \nassociated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical \ntrials or the tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program.  The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and \nthe expanded access program (n = 7,319). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: \nRenal impairment \nAs Viread may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8 Summary of the safety profile).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after \ntenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did \nnot completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of renal \nimpairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients \nreceiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete \nrecovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \nLactic acidosis \nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with \nother antiretrovirals.  Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver \ndisease, or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased \nrisk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal \noutcomes. \n \nHIV-1: \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally \nacknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The \nfrequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).  \n \nHepatitis B: \nExacerbations of hepatitis during treatment \nIn studies with nucleoside-naïve patients, on-treatment ALT elevations > 10 times ULN (upper limit \nof normal) and > 2 times baseline occurred in 2.6% of tenofovir disoproxil-treated patients.  ALT \nelevations had a median time to onset of 8 weeks, resolved with continued treatment, and, in a \nmajority of cases, were associated with a ≥ 2 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load that preceded or \ncoincided with the ALT elevation.  Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HBV infected patients, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred \nafter discontinuation of HBV therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1 \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomised trials (studies GS-US-104-0321 and \nGS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 years) who received \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1).  The adverse reactions observed in paediatric \npatients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those observed in \nclinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary of adverse \nreactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected adolescents, the \nBMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed \nin subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects \nwho switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on \ntheir stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \n(median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse \nevents.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings clinically consistent with proximal renal \ntubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil therapy.  Seven patients had estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Among them, 3 patients \nexperienced a clinically meaningful decline in estimated GFR which improved after discontinuation of \ntenofovir disoproxil. \n \nChronic hepatitis B \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on a randomised study (Study GS-US-174-0115) in \n106 adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B receiving treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks and on a randomised study \n(Study GS-US-174-0144) in 89 patients with chronic hepatitis B (2 to  < 12 years of age) receiving \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) for 48 weeks.  The adverse reactions \nobserved in paediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with \nthose observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary \nof adverse reactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been observed in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age.  \nThe BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those \nobserved in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nOther special population(s) \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HIV infected patients co-infected with HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatitis have \noccurred after discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see sections 4.8 and 5.3), \nand standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \nManagement \nTenofovir can be removed by haemodialysis; the median haemodialysis clearance of tenofovir is \n134 ml/min.  It is not known whether tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AF07 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate is the fumarate salt of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil.  Tenofovir \ndisoproxil is absorbed and converted to the active substance tenofovir, which is a nucleoside \nmonophosphate (nucleotide) analogue.  Tenofovir is then converted to the active metabolite, tenofovir \ndiphosphate, an obligate chain terminator, by constitutively expressed cellular enzymes.  Tenofovir \ndiphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in activated and 50 hours in resting peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and \nthe HBV polymerase by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate \nand, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination.  Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak \ninhibitor of cellular polymerases α, β, and γ.  At concentrations of up to 300 µmol/l, tenofovir has also \nshown no effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or the production of lactic acid in in vitro \nassays. \n \nData pertaining to HIV \nHIV antiviral activity in vitro: The concentration of tenofovir required for 50% inhibition (EC50) of the \nwild-type laboratory strain HIV-1IIIB is 1-6 µmol/l in lymphoid cell lines and 1.1 µmol/l against \nprimary HIV-1 subtype B isolates in PBMCs.  Tenofovir is also active against HIV-1 subtypes A, C, \nD, E, F, G, and O and against HIVBaL in primary monocyte/macrophage cells.  Tenofovir shows \nactivity in vitro against HIV-2, with an EC50 of 4.9 µmol/l in MT-4 cells. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n66 \n\nResistance: Strains of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir and a K65R mutation in reverse \ntranscriptase have been selected in vitro and in some patients (see Clinical efficacy and safety).  \nTenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with strains harbouring \nthe K65R mutation (see section 4.4).  In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase \nhas been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. \n \nClinical studies in treatment-experienced patients have assessed the anti-HIV activity of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg against strains of HIV-1 with resistance to nucleoside inhibitors.  The results \nindicate that patients whose HIV expressed 3 or more thymidine-analogue associated mutations \n(TAMs) that included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced \nresponse to tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg therapy. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe effects of tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults \nhave been demonstrated in trials of 48 weeks and 144 weeks duration, respectively. \n \nIn study GS-99-907, 550 treatment-experienced adult patients were treated with placebo or tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg for 24 weeks.  The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 427 cells/mm3, the mean \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 3.4 log10 copies/ml (78% of patients had a viral load of \n< 5,000 copies/ml) and the mean duration of prior HIV treatment was 5.4 years.  Baseline genotypic \nanalysis of HIV isolates from 253 patients revealed that 94% of patients had HIV-1 resistance \nmutations associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 58% had mutations associated \nwith protease inhibitors and 48% had mutations associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. \n \nAt week 24 the time-weighted average change from baseline in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \n(DAVG24) was -0.03 log10 copies/ml and -0.61 log10 copies/ml for the placebo and tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg recipients (p < 0.0001).  A statistically significant difference in favour of tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg was seen in the time-weighted average change from baseline at week 24 (DAVG24) for CD4 \ncount (+13 cells/mm3 for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus -11 cells/mm3 for placebo, \np-value = 0.0008).  The antiviral response to tenofovir disoproxil was durable through 48 weeks \n(DAVG48 was -0.57 log10 copies/ml, proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 or \n50 copies/ml was 41% and 18% respectively).  Eight (2%) tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg treated patients \ndeveloped the K65R mutation within the first 48 weeks. \n \nThe 144-week, double-blind, active controlled phase of study GS-99-903 evaluated the efficacy and \nsafety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus stavudine when used in combination with lamivudine and \nefavirenz in HIV-1 infected adult patients naïve to antiretroviral therapy.  The mean baseline CD4 cell \ncount was 279 cells/mm3, the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.91 log10 copies/ml, 19% of \npatients had symptomatic HIV-1 infection and 18% had AIDS.  Patients were stratified by baseline \nHIV-1 RNA and CD4 count.  Forty-three percent of patients had baseline viral loads \n> 100,000 copies/ml and 39% had CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/ml. \n \nBy intent to treat analysis (missing data and switch in antiretroviral therapy (ART) considered as \nfailure), the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml at \n48 weeks of treatment was 80% and 76% respectively in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, \ncompared to 84% and 80% in the stavudine arm.  At 144 weeks, the proportion of patients with \nHIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml was 71% and 68% respectively in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg arm, compared to 64% and 63% in the stavudine arm. \n \nThe average change from baseline for HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count at 48 weeks of treatment was \nsimilar in both treatment groups (-3.09 and -3.09 log10 copies/ml; +169 and 167 cells/mm3 in the \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine groups, respectively).  At 144 weeks of treatment, the \naverage change from baseline remained similar in both treatment groups (-3.07 and \n-3.03 log10 copies/ml; +263 and +283 cells/mm3 in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine \ngroups, respectively).  A consistent response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was seen \nregardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \nThe K65R mutation occurred in a slightly higher percentage of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than the active control group (2.7% versus 0.7%).  Efavirenz or lamivudine resistance either \npreceded or was coincident with the development of K65R in all cases.  Eight patients had HIV that \nexpressed K65R in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, 7 of these occurred during the first 48 weeks \nof treatment and the last one at week 96.  No further K65R development was observed up to \nweek 144.  One patient in the tenofovir disoproxil arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus.  \nFrom both the genotypic and phenotypic analyses there was no evidence for other pathways of \nresistance to tenofovir. \n \nData pertaining to HBV \n HBV antiviral activity in vitro: The in vitro antiviral activity of tenofovir against HBV was assessed \nin the HepG2 2.2.15 cell line.  The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.14 to 1.5 µmol/l, \nwith CC50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) values > 100 µmol/l. \n \nResistance: No HBV mutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil resistance have been identified \n(see Clinical efficacy and safety).  In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, \nrtL180M, and rtM204I/V mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine showed a \nsusceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild-type virus.  HBV strains \nexpressing the rtL180M, rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V and rtM250V mutations associated with \nresistance to entecavir showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of wild-\ntype virus.  HBV strains expressing the adefovir-associated resistance mutations rtA181V and \nrtN236T showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild-type virus.  \nViruses containing the rtA181T mutation remained susceptible to tenofovir with EC50 values 1.5-fold \nthat of wild-type virus. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe demonstration of benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in compensated and decompensated disease is \nbased on virological, biochemical and serological responses in adults with HBeAg positive and \nHBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B.  Treated patients included those who were treatment-naïve, \nlamivudine-experienced, adefovir dipivoxil-experienced and patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir \ndipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  Benefit has also been demonstrated based on histological \nresponses in compensated patients. \n \nExperience in patients with compensated liver disease at 48 weeks (studies GS-US-174-0102 and \nGS-US-174-0103) \nResults through 48 weeks from two randomised, phase 3 double-blind studies comparing tenofovir \ndisoproxil to adefovir dipivoxil in adult patients with compensated liver disease are presented in \nTable 3 below.  Study GS-US-174-0103 was conducted in 266 (randomised and treated) \nHBeAg positive patients while study GS-US-174-0102 was conducted in 375 (randomised and treated) \npatients negative for HBeAg and positive for HBeAb. \n \nIn both of these studies tenofovir disoproxil was significantly superior to adefovir dipivoxil for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint of complete response (defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis).  Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was also associated with significantly greater \nproportions of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, when compared to adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg \ntreatment.  Both treatments produced similar results with regard to histological response (defined as \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis) at week 48 (see Table 3 below). \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0103 a significantly greater proportion of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than in the adefovir dipivoxil group had normalised ALT and achieved HBsAg loss at week 48 \n(see Table 3 below). \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nTable 3: Efficacy parameters in compensated HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients at \nweek 48 \n \n Study 174-0102 (HBeAg negative) Study 174-0103 (HBeAg positive) \nParameter Tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg  \nn = 250 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \n\nn = 125 \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg  \n\nn = 176 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \nn = 90 \n\nComplete \nresponse (%)a \n\n71* 49 67* 12 \n\nHistology     \nHistological response \n(%)b \n\n72 \n \n\n69 74 68 \n\nMedian HBV DNA \nreduction from \nbaselinec \n(log10 copies/ml) \n\n-4.7* -4.0 -6.4* -3.7 \n\nHBV DNA (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \n(< 69 IU/ml) \n\n \n93* \n\n \n63 \n\n \n76* \n\n \n13 \n\nALT (%) \nNormalised ALTd \n\n \n76 \n\n \n77 \n\n \n68* \n\n \n54 \n\nSerology (%) \nHBeAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n \nn/a \n\n \nn/a \n\n \n22/21 \n\n \n18/18 \n\nHBsAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n0/0 0/0 3*/1 0/0 \n\n* p-value versus adefovir dipivoxil < 0.05. \na Complete response defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at \nleast 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nb Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nc Median change from baseline HBV DNA merely reflects the difference between baseline HBV DNA and the limit of \ndetection (LOD) of the assay. \nd The population used for analysis of ALT normalisation included only patients with ALT above ULN at baseline. \nn/a = not applicable. \n \nTenofovir disoproxil was associated with significantly greater proportions of patients with \nundetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche Cobas \nTaqman HBV assay), when compared to adefovir dipivoxil (study GS-US-174-0102; 91%, 56% and \nstudy GS-US-174-0103; 69%, 9%), respectively. \n \nResponse to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleoside-experienced (n = 51) \nand nucleoside-naïve (n = 375) patients and in patients with normal ALT (n = 21) and abnormal ALT \n(n = 405) at baseline when studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were combined.  \nForty-nine of the 51 nucleoside-experienced patients were previously treated with lamivudine.  \nSeventy-three percent of nucleoside-experienced and 69% of nucleoside-naïve patients achieved \ncomplete response to treatment; 90% of nucleoside-experienced and 88% of nucleoside-naïve patients \nachieved HBV DNA suppression < 400 copies/ml.

Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  was associated \nwith a mean change in serum HBV DNA from baseline, in the patients for whom there was 48-week \ndata, of -5.74 log10 copies/ml (n = 18).  In addition, 61% of patients had normal ALT at week 48. \n \nExperience in patients with persistent viral replication (study GS-US-174-0106) \nThe efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  plus 200 mg \nemtricitabine has been evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study (study GS-US-174-0106), in \nHBeAg positive and HBeAg negative adult patients who had persistent viraemia \n(HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 copies/ml) while receiving adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg for more than 24 weeks.  At \nbaseline, 57% of patients randomised to tenofovir disoproxil versus 60% of patients randomised to \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment group had previously been treated with lamivudine.  \nOverall at week 24, treatment with tenofovir disoproxil resulted in 66% (35/53) of patients with \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (< 69 IU/ml) versus 69% (36/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.672).  In addition 55% (29/53) of patients treated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil had undetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of \nthe Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV assay) versus 60% (31/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.504).  Comparisons between treatment groups beyond week 24 are difficult \n\n\n\n71 \n\nto interpret since investigators had the option to intensify treatment to open-label emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil.  Long-term studies to evaluate the benefit/risk of bitherapy with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil in HBV monoinfected patients are ongoing. \n \nExperience in patients with decompensated liver disease at 48 weeks (study GS-US-174-0108) \nStudy GS-US-174-0108 is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled study evaluating the safety \nand efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), and \nentecavir (n = 22), in patients with decompensated liver disease.  In the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \narm, patients had a mean CPT score of 7.2, mean HBV DNA of 5.8 log10 copies/ml and mean serum \nALT of 61 U/l at baseline.  Forty-two percent (19/45) of patients had at least 6 months of prior \nlamivudine experience, 20% (9/45) of patients had prior adefovir dipivoxil experience and 9 of \n45 patients (20%) had lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  The \nco-primary safety endpoints were discontinuation due to an adverse event and confirmed increase in \nserum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nIn patients with CPT scores ≤ 9, 74% (29/39) of tenofovir disoproxil, and 94% (33/35) of \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment groups achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml after \n48 weeks of treatment. \n \nOverall, the data derived from this study are too limited to draw any definitive conclusions on the \ncomparison of emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil versus tenofovir disoproxil, (see Table 7 below). \n \nTable 7: Safety and efficacy parameters in decompensated patients at week 48 \n \n Study 174-0108 \nParameter Tenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEmtricitabine 200 mg/ \ntenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEntecavir \n(0.5 mg or 1 mg) \n\nn = 22 \n\nTolerability failure \n(permanent \ndiscontinuation of study \ndrug due to a treatment \nemergent AE) \nn (%)a \n\n3 (7%) 2 (4%) 2 (9%) \n\nConfirmed increase in \nserum creatinine \n≥ 0.5 mg/dl from \nbaseline or confirmed \nserum phosphate of \n< 2 mg/dl \nn (%)b \n\n4 (9%) 3 (7%) 1 (5%) \n\nHBV DNA n (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \nn (%) \n\n31/44 (70%) 36/41 (88%) 16/22 (73%) \n\nALT n (%) \nNormal ALT \n\n25/44 (57%) 31/41 (76%) 12/22 (55%) \n\n≥ 2 point decrease in \nCPT from baseline \nn (%) \n\n7/27 (26%) 12/25 (48%) 5/12 (42%) \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in CPT score \n\n-0.8 -0.9 -1.3 \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in MELD score \n\n-1.8 -2.3 -2.6 \n\na p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 0.622, \nb p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 1.000. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nExperience beyond 48 weeks in study GS-US-174-0108 \nUsing a noncompleter/switch = failure analysis, 50% (21/42) of subjects receiving tenofovir \ndisoproxil, 76% (28/37) of subjects receiving emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil and 52% (11/21) \nof subjects receiving entecavir achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 168. \n \nExperience in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV at 240 weeks (study GS-US-174-0121) \nThe efficacy and safety of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind \nstudy (GS-US-174-0121) in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n = 280) with \ncompensated liver disease, viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 IU/ml), and genotypic evidence of \nlamivudine resistance (rtM204I/V +/- rtL180M).  Only five had adefovir-associated resistance \nmutations at baseline.  One hundred forty-one and 139 adult subjects were randomised to a tenofovir \ndisoproxil and emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, respectively.  Baseline \ndemographics were similar between the two treatment arms: At baseline, 52.5% of subjects were \nHBeAg negative, 47.5% were HBeAg positive, mean HBV DNA level was 6.5 log10 copies/ml, and \nmean ALT was 79 U/l, respectively. \n \nAfter 240 weeks of treatment, 117 of 141 subjects (83%) randomised to tenofovir disoproxil had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 51 of 79 subjects (65%) had ALT normalisation.  After 240 weeks of \ntreatment with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 115 of 139 subjects (83%) had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 59 of 83 subjects (71%) had ALT normalisation.  Among the \nHBeAg positive subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil, 16 of 65 subjects (25%) experienced \nHBeAg loss, and 8 of 65 subjects (12%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through week 240.  In \nthe HBeAg positive subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 13 of 68 subjects \n(19%) experienced HBeAg loss, and 7 of 68 subjects (10%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion \nthrough week 240.  Two subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss by \nWeek 240, but not seroconversion to anti-HBs.  Five subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss, with 2 of these 5 subjects experiencing seroconversion \nto anti-HBs. \n \nClinical resistance \nFour hundred and twenty-six HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 250) and HBeAg positive \n(GS-US-174-0103, n = 176) patients initially randomised to double-blind tenofovir disoproxil \ntreatment and then switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic \nchanges in HBV polymerase from baseline.  Genotypic evaluations performed on all patients with \nHBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 39), 96 (n = 24), 144 (n = 6), 192 (n = 5), 240 (n = 4), 288 \n(n = 6) and 384 (n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no mutations associated with \ntenofovir disoproxil resistance have developed. \n \nTwo hundred and fifteen HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 125) and HBeAg positive \n(GS-US-174-0103, n = 90) patients initially randomised to double-blind adefovir dipivoxil treatment \nand then switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic changes \nin HBV polymerase from baseline.  Genotypic evaluations performed on all patients with \nHBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 16), 96 (n = 5), 144 (n = 1), 192 (n = 2), 240 (n = 1), 288 \n(n = 1) and 384 (n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no mutations associated with \ntenofovir disoproxil resistance have developed. \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0108, 45 patients (including 9 patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil \nresistance mutations at baseline) received tenofovir disoproxil for up to 168 weeks.  Genotypic data \nfrom paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 6/8 patients with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified in these isolates.  Genotypic analysis was conducted for 5 subjects in the \ntenofovir disoproxil arm post week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil resistance were detected in any subject. \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0121, 141 patients with lamivudine resistance substitutions at baseline received \ntenofovir disoproxil for up to 240 weeks.  Cumulatively, there were 4 patients who experienced a \nviremic episode (HBV DNA>400 copies/ml) at their last timepoint on TDF.  Among them, sequence \n\n\n\n73 \n\ndata from paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 2 of 4 patients.  No amino \nacid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0115), 52 patients (including 6 patients with lamivudine resistance \nmutations at baseline) initially received blinded tenofovir disoproxil for up to 72 weeks and then \n51/52 patients switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil (TDF-TDF group).  Genotypic evaluations \nwere performed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 6), \nweek 72 (n = 5), week 96 (n = 4), week 144 (n = 2), and week 192 (n = 3).  Fifty-four patients \n(including 2 patients with lamivudine resistance mutations at baseline) initially received blinded \nplacebo treatment for 72 weeks, and 52/54 patients followed with tenofovir disoproxil (PLB-TDF \ngroup).  Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 96 (n = 17), week 144 (n = 7), and week 192 (n = 8).  No amino acid \nsubstitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0144), genotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV \nisolates from patients who received tenofovir disoproxil were available for 9 of 10 patients who had \nplasma HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml. No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to \ntenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates by week 48. \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1:  In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years \nof age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an \noptimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of \ntenofovir disoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at \nweek 24.  However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult \ndata and comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine \nBMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, \nrespectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and \n-0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the \ntenofovir disoproxil and placebo groups, respectively.  The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group compared to the placebo group.  At week 48, six adolescents in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group and one adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD \nloss (defined as > 4% loss).  Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil, BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, \nvirologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either \nreplace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original \nregimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.  At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA \nconcentrations < 400 copies/ml.  The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained \n< 400 copies/ml at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group.  When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment \ngroup had HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/ml at week 48. \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In patients who received treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and \n-0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean \nchanges at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, \nand -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or \nzidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar \nbetween the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  \nTotal body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine \nor zidovudine treatment group.  One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or \n\n\n\n74 \n\nzidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  \nBMD Z-scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who \nwere treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks.  BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and \nweight. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \ndiscontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings \nclinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil \ntherapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). \n \nChronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients \naged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, elevated serum ALT \n(≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 months] were treated with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks.  Subjects must have been naïve \nto tenofovir disoproxil, but could have received interferon based regimens (> 6 months prior to \nscreening) or any other non-tenofovir disoproxil containing oral anti-HBV nucleoside/nucleotide \ntherapy (> 16 weeks prior to screening).  At week 72, overall 88% (46/52) of patients in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment group and 0% (0/54) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-four percent (26/35) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had \nnormalised ALT at week 72 compared to 31% (13/42) in the placebo group.  Response to treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleos(t)ide-naïve (n = 20) and nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced (n = 32) patients, including lamivudine-resistant patients (n = 6).  Ninety-five percent of \nnucleos(t)ide-naïve patients, 84% of nucleos(t)ide-experienced patients, and 83% of lamivudine-\nresistant patients achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 72.  Thirty-one of the 32 nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced patients had prior lamivudine experience.  At week 72, 96% (27/28) of immune-active \npatients (HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, serum ALT > 1.5 x ULN) in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 0% (0/32) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-five \npercent (21/28) of immune-active patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normal ALT at \nweek 72 compared to 34% (11/32) in the placebo group. \n \nAfter 72 weeks of blinded randomized treatment, each subject could switch to open-label tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment up to week 192.  After week 72, virologic suppression was maintained for those \nreceiving double-blind tenofovir disoproxil followed by open-label tenofovir disoproxil (TDF-TDF \ngroup): 86.5% (45/52) of subjects in the TDF-TDF group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at \nweek 192.  Among the subjects who received placebo during the double-blind period, the proportion \nof subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL rose sharply after they began treatment with open-label \nTDF (PLB-TDF group): 74.1% (40/54) of subjects in the PLB-TDF group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml at week 192.  The proportion of subjects with ALT normalization at week 192 in the \nTDF-TDF group was 75.8% (25/33) among those who were HBeAg positive at baseline and 100.0% \n(2 of 2 subjects) among those who were HBeAg negative at baseline.  Similar percentages of subjects \nin the TDF-TDF and PLB-TDF groups (37.5% and 41.7%, respectively) experienced seroconversion \nto anti-HBe through week 192. \n \nBone Mineral Density (BMD) data from Study GS-US-174-0115 are summarized in Table 8: \n \nTable 8: Bone Mineral Density Evaluation at Baseline, Week 72 and 192 \n \n\n Baseline Week 72 Week 192 TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF \nLumbar spine mean \n(SD) BMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.42  \n(0.762) \n\n-0.26  \n(0.806) \n\n-0.49  \n(0.852)  \n\n-0.23 \n(0.893)  \n\n-0.37 \n(0.946)  \n\n-0.44 \n(0.920)  \n\nLumbar spine mean \n(SD) change from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA -0.06  (0.320) \n0.10  \n\n(0.378) \n0.02  \n\n(0.548) \n-0.10 \n\n(0.543) \n\nWhole body mean \n(SD) BMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.19  \n(1.110) \n\n−0.23 \n(0.859) \n\n−0.36 \n (1.077) \n\n−0.12 \n(0.916) \n\n−0.38 \n(0.934) \n\n−0.42 \n (0.942) \n\nWhole body mean NA NA −0.16 0.09 -0.16 -0.19  \n\n\n\n75 \n\n Baseline Week 72 Week 192 TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF \n(SD) change from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\n(0.355) (0.349) (0.521) (0.504) \n\nLumbar spine BMD at \nleast 6% decreaseb NA NA \n\n1.9% \n(1 subject) 0% \n\n3.8% \n(2 subjects) \n\n3.7% \n(2 subjects) \n\nWhole body BMD at \nleast 6% decreaseb NA NA 0% 0% 0% \n\n1.9% \n(1 subject) \n\nLumbar spine BMD \nmean % increase NA NA 5.14% 8.08% 10.05% 11.21% \n\nWhole body BMD \nmean % increase NA NA 3.07% 5.39% 6.09% 7.22% \n\nNA = Not Applicable \na BMD Z-scores not adjusted for height and weight \nb Primary safety endpoint through week 72 \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0144, 89 HBeAg-negative and -positive patients aged 2 to < 12 years with \nchronic hepatitis B were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 245 mg \n(n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) once daily for 48 weeks. Subjects must have been naïve to tenofovir \ndisoproxil, with HBV DNA > 105 copies/mL (~ 4.2 log10 IU/mL) and ALT >1.5 × the upper limit of \nnormal (ULN) at screening.  At Week 48, 77% (46 of 60) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ntreatment group and 7% (2 of 29) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL \n(69 IU/mL). Sixty-six percent (38 of 58) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normalized \nALT at week 48 compared with 15% (4 of 27) in the placebo group.  Twenty-five percent(14 of 56) of \npatients in the tenofovir disoproxil group and 24% (7 of 29) of patients in the placebo group  achieved \nHBeAg seroconversion at Week 48. \n\nResponse to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in treatment-naïve and treatment-\nexperienced subjects with 76% (38/50) of treatment-naïve and 80% (8/10) of treatment-experienced \nsubjects achieving HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/ml) at Week 48. Response to treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil was also similar in subjects who were HBeAg-negative compared with those who \nwere HBeAg-positive at baseline with 77% (43/56) HBeAg-positive and 75.0% (3/4) HBeAg-negative \nsubjects achieving HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL) at Week 48. The distribution of HBV \ngenotypes at baseline was similar between the TDF and Placebo groups.

Administration of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil \nwith a meal to HIV infected patients resulted in mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values of \n326 (36.6%) ng/ml, 3,324 (41.2%) ng·h/ml and 64.4 (39.4%) ng/ml, respectively.  Maximum tenofovir \nconcentrations are observed in serum within one hour of dosing in the fasted state and within two \nhours when taken with food.  The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted \npatients was approximately 25%.  Administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a high fat meal \nenhanced the oral bioavailability, with an increase in tenofovir AUC by approximately 40% and Cmax \nby approximately 14%.  Following the first dose of tenofovir disoproxil in fed patients, the median \nCmax in serum ranged from 213 to 375 ng/ml.  However, administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a \nlight meal did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration the steady-state volume of distribution of tenofovir was \nestimated to be approximately 800 ml/kg.  After oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir \nis distributed to most tissues with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidney, liver and the \nintestinal contents (preclinical studies).  In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum \nprotein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to \n25 µg/ml. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the \nCYP450 enzymes.  Moreover, at concentrations substantially higher (approximately 300-fold) than \nthose observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major \nhuman CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2E1, or CYP1A1/2).  Tenofovir disoproxil at a concentration of 100 µmol/l had no effect on any \nof the CYP450 isoforms, except CYP1A1/2, where a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction \nin metabolism of CYP1A1/2 substrate was observed.  Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically \nsignificant interactions involving tenofovir disoproxil and medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 \nwould occur. \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nElimination \nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system \nwith approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous \nadministration.  Total clearance has been estimated to be approximately 230 ml/h/kg (approximately \n300 ml/min).  Renal clearance has been estimated to be approximately 160 ml/h/kg (approximately \n210 ml/min), which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.  This indicates that active tubular \nsecretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir.  Following oral administration the \nterminal half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. \n \nStudies have established the pathway of active tubular secretion of tenofovir to be influx into proximal \ntubule cell by the human organic anion transporters (hOAT) 1 and 3 and efflux into the urine by the \nmultidrug resistant protein 4 (MRP 4). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were independent of tenofovir disoproxil dose over the dose range \n75 to 600 mg and were not affected by repeated dosing at any dose level. \n \nGender \nLimited data on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in women indicate no major gender effect. \n \nEthnicity \nPharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in different ethnic groups. \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1:  Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 8 HIV-1 infected adolescent \npatients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg and in 23 HIV-1 infected children aged \n2 to < 12 years (see Table 10 below).  Tenofovir exposure achieved in these paediatric patients \nreceiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or 6.5 mg/kg body weight tenofovir \ndisoproxil up to a maximum dose of 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving \nonce-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n \nTable 10: Mean (± SD) tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters by age groups for paediatric \npatients \n \n\nDose and formulation 245 mg film-coated tablet \n12 to < 18 years (n = 8) \n\n6.5 mg/kg granules \n2 to < 12 years (n = 23) \n\nCmax (μg/ml) 0.38 ± 0.13 0.24 ± 0.13 \nAUCtau (μg·h/ml) 3.39 ± 1.22 2.59 ± 1.06 \n\n \nChronic hepatitis B: Steady-state tenofovir exposure in HBV infected adolescent patients \n(12 to < 18 years of age) receiving an oral daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  was similar to \nexposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg . \n \nTenofovir exposure in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age receiving an oral daily \ndose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg of body weight (tablet or granules) up to a maximum dose of \n245 mg  was similar to exposures achieved in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age \nreceiving a once daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg . \n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in children under 2 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose of \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult patients with varying degrees of \nrenal impairment defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function \nwhen CrCl > 80 ml/min; mild with CrCl = 50-79 ml/min; moderate with CrCl = 30-49 ml/min and \nsevere with CrCl = 10-29 ml/min).  Compared with patients with normal renal function, the mean \n\n\n\n78 \n\n(%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng·h/ml in subjects with CrCl > 80 ml/min to \nrespectively 3,064 (30%) ng·h/ml, 6,009 (42%) ng·h/ml and 15,985 (45%) ng·h/ml in patients with \nmild, moderate and severe renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in non-haemodialysis adult patients with creatinine clearance \n< 10 ml/min and in patients with ESRD managed by peritoneal or other forms of dialysis have not \nbeen studied. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in paediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied.  \nNo data are available to make dose recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult \npatients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) \nclassification.  Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic \nimpairment suggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects.  The mean (%CV) \ntenofovir Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/ml and 2,050 (50.8%) ng·h/ml, respectively, \nin normal subjects compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/ml and 2,310 (43.5%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/ml and 2,740 (44.0%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment. \n \nIntracellular pharmacokinetics \nIn non-proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the half-life of tenofovir \ndiphosphate was found to be approximately 50 hours, whereas the half-life in phytohaemagglutinin-\nstimulated PBMCs was found to be approximately 10 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety pharmacology studies reveal no special hazard for humans.  Findings in repeated \ndose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical \nexposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a \ndecrease in serum phosphate concentration.  Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) \nand reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs).  The bone toxicity in young adult rats and \ndogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred \nin juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the \nexposure in patients).  Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-\nrelated decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in BMD. \n \nGenotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results \nin one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat \nhepatocytes.  However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n \nOral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an \nextremely high dose in mice.  These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. \n \nReproductive studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal \nparameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in peri-\npostnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \nThe active substance tenofovir disoproxil and its main transformation products are persistent in the \nenvironment. \n \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nWhite, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablets, of dimensions 15.4 mm x 7.3 mm, debossed on one side \nwith “GSI” and on the other side with “250”. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHIV-1 infection \nViread 204 mg film-coated tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts for the treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, with NRTI resistance or toxicities \nprecluding the use of first line agents, aged 6 to < 12 years who weigh from 28 kg to less than 35 kg. \n \nThe choice of Viread to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be based \non individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. \n \nHepatitis B infection \nViread 204 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in paediatric \npatients aged 6 to < 12 years who weigh from 28 kg to less than 35 kg, with: \n \n• compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication \n\nand persistently elevated serum ALT levels or histological evidence of moderate to severe \ninflammation and/or fibrosis.  With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in paediatric \npatients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection and/or \ntreatment of chronic hepatitis B. \n \nPosology \n \nHIV-1 and Chronic hepatitis B \nThe recommended dose for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in paediatric \npatients aged 6 to < 12 years weighing 28 kg to < 35 kg who are able to swallow film-coated tablets is \none 204 mg tablet once daily taken orally with food. \n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nPlease refer to the Summaries of Product Characteristics for Viread 123 mg and 163 mg film-coated \ntablets for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in paediatric patients aged \n6 to < 12 years weighing 17 kg to < 22 kg and 22 kg to < 28 kg, respectively. \n \nViread is also available as 33 mg/g granules for use in the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic \nhepatitis B in paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years who weigh < 17 kg or who are unable to \nswallow film-coated tablets.  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Viread \n33 mg/g granules. \n \nThe decision to treat paediatric patients should be based on careful consideration of individual patient \nneeds and with reference to current paediatric treatment guidelines including the value of baseline \nhistological information.  The benefits of long-term virologic suppression with continued therapy must \nbe weighed against the risk of prolonged treatment, including the emergence of resistant hepatitis B \nvirus and the uncertainties as regards the long term impact of bone and renal toxicity (see section 4.4). \n \nSerum ALT should be persistently elevated for at least 6 months prior to treatment of paediatric \npatients with compensated liver disease due to HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B; and for at least 12 \nmonths in patients with HBeAg negative disease. \n \nDuration of therapy in paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis B \n \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown.  Treatment discontinuation may be considered as \nfollows: \n \n- In HBeAg positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least \n\n12 months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe detection \non two consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) is confirmed or until \nHBs seroconversion or there is loss of efficacy (see section 4.4).  Serum ALT and HBV DNA \nlevels should be followed regularly after treatment discontinuation to detect any late virological \nrelapse. \n\n \n- In HBeAg negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until \n\nHBs seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy.  Treatment discontinuation may \nalso be considered after stable virological suppression is achieved (i.e. for at least 3 years) \nprovided serum ALT and HBV DNA levels are followed regularly after treatment \ndiscontinuation to detect any late virological relapse.  With prolonged treatment for more than \n2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected therapy \nremains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \nMissed dose \nIf a patient misses a dose of Viread within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Viread with food as soon as possible and resume their normal dosing schedule.  If a patient \nmisses a dose of Viread by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for their next dose, the patient \nshould not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Viread, another tablet should be taken.  If the patient \nvomits more than 1 hour after taking Viread they do not need to take another dose. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nIf Viread 204 mg film-coated tablets are discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B \nvirus (HBV), these patients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected children or children with \nchronic hepatitis B under 2 years of age have not been established.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nViread 204 mg film-coated tablets should be taken once daily, orally with food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nHIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV infected patients before initiating tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy (see below Co-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B). \n \nHIV-1 \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nHepatitis B \nPatients must be advised that tenofovir disoproxil has not been proven to prevent the risk of \ntransmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.  Appropriate \nprecautions must continue to be used. \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \n\ntenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n- Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see Section 4.5).   \n \nTriple therapy with nucleosides/nucleotides \nThere have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early \nstage in HIV patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well \nas with lamivudine and didanosine as a once-daily regimen. \n \nRenal and bone effects in adult population \nRenal effects \nTenofovir is principally eliminated via the kidney.  Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated \ncreatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been \nreported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil in clinical practice (see section 4.8). \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal safety with tenofovir has only been studied to a very limited degree in adult patients with \nimpaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min). \n \nBone effects \nIn HIV infected patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil \nwith stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve adult patients, \nsmall decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment \ngroups.  Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly \n\n\n\n84 \n\ngreater in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks.  Decreases in BMD of hip were \nsignificantly greater in this group until 96 weeks.  However, there was no increased risk of fractures or \nevidence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks. \n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen \nin patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \ninhibitor.  Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are \nat a high risk for fractures. \n \nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \ntubulopathy (see section 4.8). \n \nRenal and bone effects in paediatric population \nThere are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity.  Moreover, the \nreversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is \nrecommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide \nthe appropriate monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and \nconsider the need for supplementation. \n \nRenal effects \nRenal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in \nHIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nRenal monitoring \nIt is recommended that renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) is assessed in all \npatients prior to initiating therapy with tenofovir disoproxil and that it is also monitored after two to \nfour weeks of treatment, after three months of treatment and every three to six months thereafter in \npatients without renal risk factors.  In patients at risk for renal impairment, a more frequent monitoring \nof renal function is required. \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving \ntenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements \nof blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal \ntubulopathy).  If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist \nshould be obtained to consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil treatment.  Interrupting treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function \nwhen no other cause has been identified. \n \nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, \nvancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2).  If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil and nephrotoxic \nagents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. \n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors \nfor renal dysfunction.  If tenofovir disoproxil is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should \nbe monitored adequately. \n \nA higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil in \ncombination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor.  A close monitoring of renal \nfunction is required in these patients (see section 4.5).  In patients with renal risk factors, the \nco-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully \nevaluated. \n \n\n\n\n85 \n\nTenofovir disoproxil has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which \nare secreted by the same renal pathway, including the transport proteins human organic anion \ntransporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product).  These \nrenal transport proteins may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of \ntenofovir and cidofovir.  Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products, which are \nsecreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 or MRP 4, might be \nmodified if they are co-administered.  Unless clearly necessary, concomitant use of these medicinal \nproducts which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not recommended, but if such use is \nunavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2).  Tenofovir disoproxil should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal impairment \nand should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy. \n \nBone effects \nViread may cause a reduction in BMD.  The effects of tenofovir disoproxil-associated changes in \nBMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown (see section 5.1). \n \nIf bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with an \nendocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. \n \n \nLiver disease \nTenofovir and tenofovir disoproxil are not metabolised by liver enzymes.  A pharmacokinetic study \nhas been performed in non-HIV infected adult patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment.  \nNo significant pharmacokinetic alteration has been observed in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis \nFlares on treatment: Spontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are \ncharacterised by transient increases in serum ALT.  After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may \nincrease in some patients (see section 4.8).  In patients with compensated liver disease, these increases \nin serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or \nhepatic decompensation.  Patients with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation \nfollowing hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. \n \nFlares after treatment discontinuation: Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been reported in \npatients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy.  Post-treatment exacerbations are usually \nassociated with rising HBV DNA, and the majority appears to be self-limited.  However, severe \nexacerbations, including fatalities, have been reported.  Hepatic function should be monitored at \nrepeated intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after \ndiscontinuation of hepatitis B therapy.  If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be \nwarranted.  In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not \nrecommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. \n \nLiver flares are especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated liver disease. \n \nCo-infection with hepatitis C or D: There are no data on the efficacy of tenofovir in patients \nco-infected with hepatitis C or D virus. \n \nCo-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B: Due to the risk of development of HIV resistance, tenofovir \ndisoproxil should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients.  Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active \nhepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART) and should be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is \nevidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must \n\n\n\n86 \n\nbe considered.  However, it should be noted that increases of ALT can be part of HBV clearance \nduring therapy with tenofovir, see above Exacerbations of hepatitis. \n \nUse with certain hepatitis C virus antiviral agents \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, \nespecially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).  The safety of tenofovir disoproxil in the setting of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established.  The potential risks and benefits associated with \nco-administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with tenofovir disoproxil given in conjunction with a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, particularly in patients at \nincreased risk of renal dysfunction.  Patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported, particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nExcipients \n \nViread 204 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate.  Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should \nnot take this medicine. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nBased on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the \npotential for CYP450-mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir \ndisoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nDidanosine \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and \nTable 1). \n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products \nSince tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with \nmedicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport \nproteins hOAT 1, hOAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir \nand/or the co-administered medicinal products. \n \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, \nfoscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). \n \nGiven that tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when it is \nco-administered with tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nOther interactions \nInteractions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below \n(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, and once daily \nas “q.d.”). \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\nTable 1: Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\n(dose in mg) \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, Cmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation \nconcerning \n\nco-administration with \n245 mg tenofovir disoproxil  \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntiretrovirals \nProtease inhibitors \nAtazanavir/Ritonavir \n(300 q.d./100 q.d.) \n\nAtazanavir: \nAUC: ↓ 25% \nCmax: ↓ 28% \nCmin: ↓ 26% \nTenofovir: \nAUC: ↑ 37% \nCmax: ↑ 34% \nCmin: ↑ 29% \n\nNo dose adjustment is \nrecommended.

Animal studies do not \nindicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The use of tenofovir disoproxil may be considered \nduring pregnancy, if necessary. \n \nIn the literature, exposure to tenofovir disoproxil in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to \nreduce the risk of HBV transmission from mother to infant if tenofovir disoproxil is given to mothers, \nin addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine in infants.  \n\nIn three controlled clinical trials, a total of 327 pregnant women with chronic HBV infection were \nadministered tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg) once daily from 28 to 32 weeks gestation through 1 to 2 \nmonths postpartum; women and their infants were followed for up to 12 months after delivery.  No \nsafety signal has emerged from these data. \n\nBreast-feeding \nTenofovir has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the \neffects of tenofovir in newborns/infants.  Therefore Viread should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \nAs a general rule, it is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants in order \nto avoid transmission of HIV to the infant. \n \nFertility \nThere are limited clinical data with respect to the effect of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility.  Animal \nstudies do not indicate harmful effects of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, \npatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil, rare events of renal impairment, \nrenal failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \nsometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have been reported.  \nMonitoring of renal function is recommended for patients receiving Viread (see section 4.4). \n \nHIV-1: Approximately one third of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions following \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  These reactions \nare usually mild to moderate gastrointestinal events.  Approximately 1% of tenofovir \ndisoproxil-treated adult patients discontinued treatment due to the gastrointestinal events. \n \nHepatitis B: Approximately one quarter of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions \nfollowing treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, most of which are mild.  In clinical trials of \nHBV infected patients, the most frequently occurring adverse reaction to tenofovir disoproxil was \nnausea (5.4%). \n \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients on treatment as well as in patients who \nhave discontinued hepatitis B therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nAssessment of adverse reactions for tenofovir disoproxil is based on safety data from clinical studies \nand post-marketing experience.  All adverse reactions are presented in Table 2. \n \nHIV-1 clinical studies:  Assessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on \nexperience in two studies in 653 treatment-experienced adult patients receiving treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil (n = 443) or placebo (n = 210) in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts for 24 weeks and also in a double-blind comparative controlled study in which 600 \ntreatment-naïve adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 299) or \nstavudine (n = 301) in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz for 144 weeks. \n \nHepatitis B clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HBV clinical study data is \nprimarily based on experience in two double-blind comparative controlled studies in which 641 adult \npatients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg  daily (n = 426) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily (n = 215) for 48 weeks.  The \nadverse reactions observed with continued treatment for 384 weeks were consistent with the safety \nprofile of tenofovir disoproxil.  After an initial decline of approximately -4.9 ml/min (using \nCockcroft-Gault equation) or -3.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (using modification of diet in renal disease \n[MDRD] equation) after the first 4 weeks of treatment, the rate of annual decline post baseline of renal \nfunction reported in tenofovir disoproxil treated patients was -1.41 ml/min per year (using \nCockcroft-Gault equation) and -0.74 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (using MDRD equation). \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\nPatients with decompensated liver disease: The safety profile of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with \ndecompensated liver disease was assessed in a double-blind active controlled study \n(GS-US-174-0108) in which adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or entecavir (n = 22) for 48 weeks. \n \nIn the tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse \nevent; 9% of patients experienced a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl through week 48; there were no statistically significant \ndifferences between the combined tenofovir-containing arms and the entecavir arm.  After 168 weeks, \n16% (7/45) of the tenofovir disoproxil group, 4% (2/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup, and 14% (3/22) of the entecavir group experienced tolerability failure.  Thirteen percent (6/45) \nof the tenofovir disoproxil group, 13% (6/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group, and \n9% (2/22) of the entecavir group had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nAt week 168, in this population of patients with decompensated liver disease, the rate of death was of \n13% (6/45) in the tenofovir disoproxil group, 11% (5/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup and 14% (3/22) in the entecavir group.  The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was 18% (8/45) in \nthe tenofovir disoproxil group, 7% (3/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group and 9% \n(2/22) in the entecavir group. \n \nSubjects with a high baseline CPT score were at higher risk of developing serious adverse events \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B: No new adverse reactions to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified from a randomised, double-blind study (GS-US-174-0121) in which 280 \nlamivudine-resistant patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 141) or \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (n = 139) for 240 weeks. \n \nThe adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment are listed below by \nbody system organ class and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil based on \nclinical study and post-marketing experience \n \nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common: hypophosphataemia1 \nUncommon: hypokalaemia1 \nRare: lactic acidosis \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common: dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \nCommon: flatulence \nUncommon: pancreatitis \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nCommon: increased transaminases \nRare: hepatic steatosis, hepatitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common: rash \nRare: angioedema \n\n\n\n103 \n\nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nUncommon: rhabdomyolysis1, muscular weakness1 \n\nRare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures)\n1, \n\n2, myopathy1 \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nUncommon: increased creatinine, proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \n\nRare: acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, nephritis (including acute interstitial nephritis)2, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common: asthenia \n1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally \nassociated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical \ntrials or the tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program.  The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and \nthe expanded access program (n = 7,319). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: \nRenal impairment \nAs Viread may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8 Summary of the safety profile).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after \ntenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did \nnot completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of renal \nimpairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients \nreceiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete \nrecovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \nLactic acidosis \nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with \nother antiretrovirals.  Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver \ndisease, or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased \nrisk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal \noutcomes. \n \nHIV-1: \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nHepatitis B: \nExacerbations of hepatitis during treatment \nIn studies with nucleoside-naïve patients, on-treatment ALT elevations > 10 times ULN (upper limit \nof normal) and > 2 times baseline occurred in 2.6% of tenofovir disoproxil-treated patients.  ALT \nelevations had a median time to onset of 8 weeks, resolved with continued treatment, and, in a \n\n\n\n104 \n\nmajority of cases, were associated with a ≥ 2 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load that preceded or \ncoincided with the ALT elevation.  Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HBV infected patients, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred \nafter discontinuation of HBV therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1: \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomised trials (studies GS-US-104-0321 and \nGS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 years) who received \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1).  The adverse reactions observed in paediatric \npatients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those observed in \nclinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary of adverse \nreactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected adolescents, the \nBMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed \nin subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects \nwho switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on \ntheir stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \n(median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse \nevents.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings clinically consistent with proximal renal \ntubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil therapy.  Seven patients had estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Among them, 3 patients \nexperienced a clinically meaningful decline in estimated GFR which improved after discontinuation of \ntenofovir disoproxil. \n \nChronic hepatitis B \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on one randomised study (Study GS-US-174-0115) in \n106 adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B receiving treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks and another randomized study \n(study GS-US-174-0144) in 89 patients with chronic hepatitis B (2 to  < 12 years of age) receiving \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) for 48 weeks.  The adverse reactions \nobserved in paediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with \nthose observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary \nof adverse reactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been observed in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age.  \nThe BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those \nobserved in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nOther special population(s) \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HIV infected patients co-infected with HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatitis have \noccurred after discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n105 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see sections 4.8 and 5.3), \nand standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \nManagement \nTenofovir can be removed by haemodialysis; the median haemodialysis clearance of tenofovir is \n134 ml/min.  It is not known whether tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AF07 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate is the fumarate salt of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil.  Tenofovir \ndisoproxil is absorbed and converted to the active substance tenofovir, which is a nucleoside \nmonophosphate (nucleotide) analogue.  Tenofovir is then converted to the active metabolite, tenofovir \ndiphosphate, an obligate chain terminator, by constitutively expressed cellular enzymes.  Tenofovir \ndiphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in activated and 50 hours in resting peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and \nthe HBV polymerase by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate \nand, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination.  Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak \ninhibitor of cellular polymerases α, β, and γ.  At concentrations of up to 300 µmol/l, tenofovir has also \nshown no effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or the production of lactic acid in in vitro \nassays. \n \nData pertaining to HIV \nHIV antiviral activity in vitro: The concentration of tenofovir required for 50% inhibition (EC50) of the \nwild-type laboratory strain HIV-1IIIB is 1-6 µmol/l in lymphoid cell lines and 1.1 µmol/l against \nprimary HIV-1 subtype B isolates in PBMCs.  Tenofovir is also active against HIV-1 subtypes A, C, \nD, E, F, G, and O and against HIVBaL in primary monocyte/macrophage cells.  Tenofovir shows \nactivity in vitro against HIV-2, with an EC50 of 4.9 µmol/l in MT-4 cells. \n \nResistance: Strains of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir and a K65R mutation in reverse \ntranscriptase have been selected in vitro and in some patients (see Clinical efficacy and safety).  \nTenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with strains harbouring \nthe K65R mutation (see section 4.4).  In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase \nhas been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. \n \nClinical studies in treatment-experienced patients have assessed the anti-HIV activity of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg against strains of HIV-1 with resistance to nucleoside inhibitors.  The results \nindicate that patients whose HIV expressed 3 or more thymidine-analogue associated mutations \n(TAMs) that included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced \nresponse to tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg therapy. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n106 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe effects of tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults \nhave been demonstrated in trials of 48 weeks and 144 weeks duration, respectively. \n \nIn study GS-99-907, 550 treatment-experienced adult patients were treated with placebo or tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg for 24 weeks.  The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 427 cells/mm3, the mean \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 3.4 log10 copies/ml (78% of patients had a viral load of \n< 5,000 copies/ml) and the mean duration of prior HIV treatment was 5.4 years.  Baseline genotypic \nanalysis of HIV isolates from 253 patients revealed that 94% of patients had HIV-1 resistance \nmutations associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 58% had mutations associated \nwith protease inhibitors and 48% had mutations associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. \n \nAt week 24 the time-weighted average change from baseline in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \n(DAVG24) was -0.03 log10 copies/ml and -0.61 log10 copies/ml for the placebo and tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg recipients (p < 0.0001).  A statistically significant difference in favour of tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg was seen in the time-weighted average change from baseline at week 24 (DAVG24) for CD4 \ncount (+13 cells/mm3 for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus -11 cells/mm3 for placebo, \np-value = 0.0008).  The antiviral response to tenofovir disoproxil was durable through 48 weeks \n(DAVG48 was -0.57 log10 copies/ml, proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 or \n50 copies/ml was 41% and 18% respectively).  Eight (2%) tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg treated patients \ndeveloped the K65R mutation within the first 48 weeks. \n \nThe 144-week, double-blind, active controlled phase of study GS-99-903 evaluated the efficacy and \nsafety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus stavudine when used in combination with lamivudine and \nefavirenz in HIV-1 infected adult patients naïve to antiretroviral therapy.  The mean baseline CD4 cell \ncount was 279 cells/mm3, the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.91 log10 copies/ml, 19% of \npatients had symptomatic HIV-1 infection and 18% had AIDS.  Patients were stratified by baseline \nHIV-1 RNA and CD4 count.  Forty-three percent of patients had baseline viral loads \n> 100,000 copies/ml and 39% had CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/ml. \n \nBy intent to treat analysis (missing data and switch in antiretroviral therapy (ART) considered as \nfailure), the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml at \n48 weeks of treatment was 80% and 76% respectively in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, \ncompared to 84% and 80% in the stavudine arm.  At 144 weeks, the proportion of patients with \nHIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml was 71% and 68% respectively in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg arm, compared to 64% and 63% in the stavudine arm. \n \nThe average change from baseline for HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count at 48 weeks of treatment was \nsimilar in both treatment groups (-3.09 and -3.09 log10 copies/ml; +169 and 167 cells/mm3 in the \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine groups, respectively).  At 144 weeks of treatment, the \naverage change from baseline remained similar in both treatment groups (-3.07 and \n-3.03 log10 copies/ml; +263 and +283 cells/mm3 in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine \ngroups, respectively).  A consistent response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was seen \nregardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count. \n \nThe K65R mutation occurred in a slightly higher percentage of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than the active control group (2.7% versus 0.7%).  Efavirenz or lamivudine resistance either \npreceded or was coincident with the development of K65R in all cases.  Eight patients had HIV that \nexpressed K65R in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, 7 of these occurred during the first 48 weeks \nof treatment and the last one at week 96.  No further K65R development was observed up to \nweek 144.  One patient in the tenofovir disoproxil arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus.  \nFrom both the genotypic and phenotypic analyses there was no evidence for other pathways of \nresistance to tenofovir. \n \n\n\n\n107 \n\nData pertaining to HBV \n HBV antiviral activity in vitro: The in vitro antiviral activity of tenofovir against HBV was assessed \nin the HepG2 2.2.15 cell line.  The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.14 to 1.5 µmol/l, \nwith CC50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) values > 100 µmol/l. \n \nResistance: No HBV mutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil resistance have been identified \n(see Clinical efficacy and safety).  In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, \nrtL180M, and rtM204I/V mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine showed a \nsusceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild-type virus.  HBV strains \nexpressing the rtL180M, rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V and rtM250V mutations associated with \nresistance to entecavir showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of wild-\ntype virus.  HBV strains expressing the adefovir-associated resistance mutations rtA181V and \nrtN236T showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild-type virus.  \nViruses containing the rtA181T mutation remained susceptible to tenofovir with EC50 values 1.5-fold \nthat of wild-type virus. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe demonstration of benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in compensated and decompensated disease is \nbased on virological, biochemical and serological responses in adults with HBeAg positive and \nHBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B.  Treated patients included those who were treatment-naïve, \nlamivudine-experienced, adefovir dipivoxil-experienced and patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir \ndipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  Benefit has also been demonstrated based on histological \nresponses in compensated patients. \n \nExperience in patients with compensated liver disease at 48 weeks (studies GS-US-174-0102 and \nGS-US-174-0103) \nResults through 48 weeks from two randomised, phase 3 double-blind studies comparing tenofovir \ndisoproxil to adefovir dipivoxil in adult patients with compensated liver disease are presented in \nTable 3 below.  Study GS-US-174-0103 was conducted in 266 (randomised and treated) \nHBeAg positive patients while study GS-US-174-0102 was conducted in 375 (randomised and treated) \npatients negative for HBeAg and positive for HBeAb. \n \nIn both of these studies tenofovir disoproxil was significantly superior to adefovir dipivoxil for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint of complete response (defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis).  Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was also associated with significantly greater \nproportions of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, when compared to adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg \ntreatment.  Both treatments produced similar results with regard to histological response (defined as \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis) at week 48 (see Table 3 below). \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0103 a significantly greater proportion of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than in the adefovir dipivoxil group had normalised ALT and achieved HBsAg loss at week 48 \n(see Table 3 below). \n \n\n\n\n108 \n\nTable 3: Efficacy parameters in compensated HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients at \nweek 48 \n \n Study 174-0102 (HBeAg negative) Study 174-0103 (HBeAg positive) \nParameter Tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg \nn = 250 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \n\nn = 125 \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg \n\nn = 176 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \nn = 90 \n\nComplete \nresponse (%)a \n\n71* 49 67* 12 \n\nHistology     \nHistological response \n(%)b \n\n72 \n \n\n69 74 68 \n\nMedian HBV DNA \nreduction from \nbaselinec \n(log10 copies/ml) \n\n-4.7* -4.0 -6.4* -3.7 \n\nHBV DNA (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \n(< 69 IU/ml) \n\n \n93* \n\n \n63 \n\n \n76* \n\n \n13 \n\nALT (%) \nNormalised ALTd \n\n \n76 \n\n \n77 \n\n \n68* \n\n \n54 \n\nSerology (%) \nHBeAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n \nn/a \n\n \nn/a \n\n \n22/21 \n\n \n18/18 \n\nHBsAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n0/0 0/0 3*/1 0/0 \n\n* p-value versus adefovir dipivoxil < 0.05. \na Complete response defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at \nleast 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nb Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nc Median change from baseline HBV DNA merely reflects the difference between baseline HBV DNA and the limit of \ndetection (LOD) of the assay. \nd The population used for analysis of ALT normalisation included only patients with ALT above ULN at baseline. \nn/a = not applicable. \n \nTenofovir disoproxil was associated with significantly greater proportions of patients with \nundetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche Cobas \nTaqman HBV assay), when compared to adefovir dipivoxil (study GS-US-174-0102; 91%, 56% and \nstudy GS-US-174-0103; 69%, 9%), respectively. \n \nResponse to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleoside-experienced (n = 51) \nand nucleoside-naïve (n = 375) patients and in patients with normal ALT (n = 21) and abnormal ALT \n(n = 405) at baseline when studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were combined.  \nForty-nine of the 51 nucleoside-experienced patients were previously treated with lamivudine.  \nSeventy-three percent of nucleoside-experienced and 69% of nucleoside-naïve patients achieved \ncomplete response to treatment; 90% of nucleoside-experienced and 88% of nucleoside-naïve patients \nachieved HBV DNA suppression < 400 copies/ml.

Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  was associated \nwith a mean change in serum HBV DNA from baseline, in the patients for whom there was 48-week \ndata, of -5.74 log10 copies/ml (n = 18).  In addition, 61% of patients had normal ALT at week 48. \n \nExperience in patients with persistent viral replication (study GS-US-174-0106) \nThe efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  plus 200 mg \nemtricitabine has been evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study (study GS-US-174-0106), in \nHBeAg positive and HBeAg negative adult patients who had persistent viraemia \n(HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 copies/ml) while receiving adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg for more than 24 weeks.  At \nbaseline, 57% of patients randomised to tenofovir disoproxil versus 60% of patients randomised to \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment group had previously been treated with lamivudine.  \nOverall at week 24, treatment with tenofovir disoproxil resulted in 66% (35/53) of patients with \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (< 69 IU/ml) versus 69% (36/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.672).  In addition 55% (29/53) of patients treated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil had undetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of \nthe Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV assay) versus 60% (31/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.504).  Comparisons between treatment groups beyond week 24 are difficult \n\n\n\n111 \n\nto interpret since investigators had the option to intensify treatment to open-label emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil.  Long-term studies to evaluate the benefit/risk of bitherapy with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil in HBV monoinfected patients are ongoing. \n \nExperience in patients with decompensated liver disease at 48 weeks (study GS-US-174-0108) \nStudy GS-US-174-0108 is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled study evaluating the safety \nand efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), and \nentecavir (n = 22), in patients with decompensated liver disease.  In the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \narm, patients had a mean CPT score of 7.2, mean HBV DNA of 5.8 log10 copies/ml and mean serum \nALT of 61 U/l at baseline.  Forty-two percent (19/45) of patients had at least 6 months of prior \nlamivudine experience, 20% (9/45) of patients had prior adefovir dipivoxil experience and 9 of \n45 patients (20%) had lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  The \nco-primary safety endpoints were discontinuation due to an adverse event and confirmed increase in \nserum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nIn patients with CPT scores ≤ 9, 74% (29/39) of tenofovir disoproxil, and 94% (33/35) of \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment groups achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml after \n48 weeks of treatment. \n \nOverall, the data derived from this study are too limited to draw any definitive conclusions on the \ncomparison of emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil versus tenofovir disoproxil, (see Table 7 below). \n \nTable 7: Safety and efficacy parameters in decompensated patients at week 48 \n \n Study 174-0108 \nParameter Tenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEmtricitabine 200 mg/ \ntenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEntecavir \n(0.5 mg or 1 mg) \n\nn = 22 \n\nTolerability failure \n(permanent \ndiscontinuation of study \ndrug due to a treatment \nemergent AE) \nn (%)a \n\n3 (7%) 2 (4%) 2 (9%) \n\nConfirmed increase in \nserum creatinine \n≥ 0.5 mg/dl from \nbaseline or confirmed \nserum phosphate of \n< 2 mg/dl \nn (%)b \n\n4 (9%) 3 (7%) 1 (5%) \n\nHBV DNA n (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \nn (%) \n\n31/44 (70%) 36/41 (88%) 16/22 (73%) \n\nALT n (%) \nNormal ALT \n\n25/44 (57%) 31/41 (76%) 12/22 (55%) \n\n≥ 2 point decrease in \nCPT from baseline \nn (%) \n\n7/27 (26%) 12/25 (48%) 5/12 (42%) \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in CPT score \n\n-0.8 -0.9 -1.3 \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in MELD score \n\n-1.8 -2.3 -2.6 \n\na p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 0.622, \nb p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 1.000. \n \n\n\n\n112 \n\nExperience beyond 48 weeks in study GS-US-174-0108 \nUsing a noncompleter/switch = failure analysis, 50% (21/42) of subjects receiving tenofovir \ndisoproxil, 76% (28/37) of subjects receiving emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil and 52% (11/21) \nof subjects receiving entecavir achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 168. \n \nExperience in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV at 240 weeks (study GS-US-174-0121) \nThe efficacy and safety of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind \nstudy (GS-US-174-0121) in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n = 280) with \ncompensated liver disease, viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 IU/ml), and genotypic evidence of \nlamivudine resistance (rtM204I/V +/- rtL180M).  Only five had adefovir-associated resistance \nmutations at baseline.  One hundred forty-one and 139 adult subjects were randomised to a tenofovir \ndisoproxil and emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, respectively.  Baseline \ndemographics were similar between the two treatment arms: At baseline, 52.5% of subjects were \nHBeAg negative, 47.5% were HBeAg positive, mean HBV DNA level was 6.5 log10 copies/ml, and \nmean ALT was 79 U/l, respectively. \n \nAfter 240 weeks of treatment, 117 of 141 subjects (83%) randomised to tenofovir disoproxil had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 51 of 79 subjects (65%) had ALT normalisation.  After 240 weeks of \ntreatment with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 115 of 139 subjects (83%) had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 59 of 83 subjects (71%) had ALT normalisation.  Among the \nHBeAg positive subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil, 16 of 65 subjects (25%) experienced \nHBeAg loss, and 8 of 65 subjects (12%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through week 240.  In \nthe HBeAg positive subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 13 of 68 subjects \n(19%) experienced HBeAg loss, and 7 of 68 subjects (10%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion \nthrough week 240.  Two subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss by \nWeek 240, but not seroconversion to anti-HBs.  Five subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss, with 2 of these 5 subjects experiencing seroconversion \nto anti-HBs. \n \nClinical resistance \nFour hundred and twenty-six HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 250) and HBeAg positive \n(GS-US-174-0103, n = 176) patients initially randomised to double-blind tenofovir disoproxil \ntreatment and then switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic \nchanges in HBV polymerase from baseline.  Genotypic evaluations performed on all patients with \nHBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 39), 96 (n = 24), 144 (n = 6), 192 (n = 5), 240 (n = 4), 288 \n(n = 6) and 384 (n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no mutations associated with \ntenofovir disoproxil resistance have developed. \n \nTwo hundred and fifteen HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 125) and HBeAg positive \n(GS-US-174-0103, n = 90) patients initially randomised to double-blind adefovir dipivoxil treatment \nand then switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic changes \nin HBV polymerase from baseline.  Genotypic evaluations performed on all patients with \nHBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 16), 96 (n = 5), 144 (n = 1), 192 (n = 2), 240 (n = 1), 288 \n(n = 1) and 384 (n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no mutations associated with \ntenofovir disoproxil resistance have developed. \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0108, 45 patients (including 9 patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil \nresistance mutations at baseline) received tenofovir disoproxil for up to 168 weeks.  Genotypic data \nfrom paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 6/8 patients with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified in these isolates.  Genotypic analysis was conducted for 5 subjects in the \ntenofovir disoproxil arm post week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil resistance were detected in any subject. \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0121, 141 patients with lamivudine resistance substitutions at baseline received \ntenofovir disoproxil for up to 240 weeks.  Cumulatively, there were 4 patients who experienced a \nviremic episode (HBV DNA>400 copies/ml) at their last timepoint on TDF.  Among them, sequence \n\n\n\n113 \n\ndata from paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 2 of 4 patients.  No amino \nacid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0115), 52 patients (including 6 patients with lamivudine resistance \nmutations at baseline) initially received blinded tenofovir disoproxil for up to 72 weeks and then \n51/52 patients switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil (TDF-TDF group).  Genotypic evaluations \nwere performed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 6), \nweek 72 (n = 5), week 96 (n = 4), week 144 (n = 2), and week 192 (n = 3).  Fifty-four patients \n(including 2 patients with lamivudine resistance mutations at baseline) initially received blinded \nplacebo treatment for 72 weeks, and 52/54 patients followed with tenofovir disoproxil (PLB-TDF \ngroup).  Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 96 (n = 17), week 144 (n = 7), and week 192 (n = 8).  No amino acid \nsubstitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0144), genotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV \nisolates from patients who received tenofovir disoproxil were available for 9 of 10 patients who had \nplasma HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml. No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to \ntenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates by week 48. \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years \nof age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an \noptimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of \ntenofovir disoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at \nweek 24.  However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult \ndata and comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine \nBMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, \nrespectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and \n-0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the \ntenofovir disoproxil and placebo groups, respectively.  The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group compared to the placebo group.  At week 48, six adolescents in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group and one adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD \nloss (defined as > 4% loss).  Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil, BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, \nvirologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either \nreplace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original \nregimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.  At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA \nconcentrations < 400 copies/ml.  The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained \n< 400 copies/ml at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group.  When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment \ngroup had HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/ml at week 48. \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In patients who received treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and \n-0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean \nchanges at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, \nand -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or \nzidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar \nbetween the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  \nTotal body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine \nor zidovudine treatment group.  One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or \n\n\n\n114 \n\nzidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  \nBMD Z-scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who \nwere treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks.  BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and \nweight. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \ndiscontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings \nclinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil \ntherapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). \n \nChronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients \naged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, elevated serum ALT \n(≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 months] were treated with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks.  Subjects must have been naïve \nto tenofovir disoproxil, but could have received interferon based regimens (> 6 months prior to \nscreening) or any other non-tenofovir disoproxil containing oral anti-HBV nucleoside/nucleotide \ntherapy (> 16 weeks prior to screening).  At week 72, overall 88% (46/52) of patients in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment group and 0% (0/54) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-four percent (26/35) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had \nnormalised ALT at week 72 compared to 31% (13/42) in the placebo group.  Response to treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleos(t)ide-naïve (n = 20) and nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced (n = 32) patients, including lamivudine-resistant patients (n = 6).  Ninety-five percent of \nnucleos(t)ide-naïve patients, 84% of nucleos(t)ide-experienced patients, and 83% of lamivudine-\nresistant patients achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 72.  Thirty-one of the 32 nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced patients had prior lamivudine experience.  At week 72, 96% (27/28) of immune-active \npatients (HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, serum ALT > 1.5 x ULN) in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 0% (0/32) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-five \npercent (21/28) of immune-active patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normal ALT at \nweek 72 compared to 34% (11/32) in the placebo group. \n \nAfter 72 weeks of blinded randomized treatment, each subject could switch to open-label tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment up to week 192.  After week 72, virologic suppression was maintained for those \nreceiving double-blind tenofovir disoproxil followed by open-label tenofovir disoproxil (TDF-TDF \ngroup): 86.5% (45/52) of subjects in the TDF-TDF group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at \nweek 192.  Among the subjects who received placebo during the double-blind period, the proportion \nof subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL rose sharply after they began treatment with open-label \nTDF (PLB-TDF group): 74.1% (40/54) of subjects in the PLB-TDF group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml at week 192.  The proportion of subjects with ALT normalization at week 192 in the \nTDF-TDF group was 75.8% (25/33) among those who were HBeAg positive at baseline and 100.0% \n(2 of 2 subjects) among those who were HBeAg negative at baseline.  Similar percentages of subjects \nin the TDF-TDF and PLB-TDF groups (37.5% and 41.7%, respectively) experienced seroconversion \nto anti-HBe through week 192. \n \nBone Mineral Density (BMD) data from Study GS-US-174-0115 are summarized in Table 8: \n \nTable 8: Bone Mineral Density Evaluation at Baseline, Week 72 and 192 \n \n\n Baseline Week 72 Week 192 TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF \nLumbar spine mean \n(SD) BMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.42  \n(0.762) \n\n-0.26  \n(0.806) \n\n-0.49  \n(0.852)  \n\n-0.23 \n(0.893)  \n\n-0.37 \n(0.946)  \n\n-0.44 \n(0.920)  \n\nLumbar spine mean \n(SD) change from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA -0.06  (0.320) \n0.10  \n\n(0.378) \n0.02  \n\n(0.548) \n-0.10 \n\n(0.543) \n\nWhole body mean \n(SD) BMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.19  \n(1.110) \n\n−0.23 \n(0.859) \n\n−0.36 \n (1.077) \n\n−0.12 \n(0.916) \n\n−0.38 \n(0.934) \n\n−0.42 \n (0.942) \n\nWhole body mean NA NA −0.16 0.09 -0.16 -0.19  \n\n\n\n115 \n\n Baseline Week 72 Week 192 TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF TDF-TDF PLB-TDF \n(SD) change from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\n(0.355) (0.349) (0.521) (0.504) \n\nLumbar spine BMD at \nleast 6% decreaseb NA NA \n\n1.9% \n(1 subject) 0% \n\n3.8% \n(2 subjects) \n\n3.7% \n(2 subjects) \n\nWhole body BMD at \nleast 6% decreaseb NA NA 0% 0% 0% \n\n1.9% \n(1 subject) \n\nLumbar spine BMD \nmean % increase NA NA 5.14% 8.08% 10.05% 11.21% \n\nWhole body BMD \nmean % increase NA NA 3.07% 5.39% 6.09% 7.22% \n\nNA = Not Applicable \na BMD Z-scores not adjusted for height and weight \nb Primary safety endpoint through week 72 \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0144, 89 HBeAg-negative and -positive patients aged 2 to < 12 years with \nchronic hepatitis B were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 245 mg \n(n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) once daily for 48 weeks. Subjects must have been naïve to tenofovir \ndisoproxil, with HBV DNA > 105 copies/mL (~ 4.2 log10 IU/mL) and ALT >1.5 × the upper limit of \nnormal (ULN) at screening.  At Week 48, 77% (46 of 60) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ntreatment group and 7% (2 of 29) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL \n(69 IU/mL). Sixty-six percent (38 of 58) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normalized \nALT at week 48 compared with 15% (4 of 27) in the placebo group. Twenty-five percent (14 of 56) of \npatients in the tenofovir disoproxil group and 24% (7 of 29) of patients in the placebo group achieved \nHBeAg seroconversion at Week 48. \n\nResponse to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in treatment-naïve and treatment-\nexperienced subjects with 76% (38/50) of treatment-naïve and 80% (8/10) of treatment-experienced \nsubjects achieving HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/ml) at Week 48. Response to treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil was also similar in subjects who were HBeAg-negative compared with those who \nwere HBeAg-positive at baseline with 77% (43/56) HBeAg-positive and 75.0% (3/4) HBeAg-negative \nsubjects achieving HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL) at Week 48. The distribution of HBV \ngenotypes at baseline was similar between the TDF and Placebo groups.

Administration of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil \nwith a meal to HIV infected patients resulted in mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values of \n326 (36.6%) ng/ml, 3,324 (41.2%) ng·h/ml and 64.4 (39.4%) ng/ml, respectively.  Maximum tenofovir \nconcentrations are observed in serum within one hour of dosing in the fasted state and within two \nhours when taken with food.  The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted \npatients was approximately 25%.  Administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a high fat meal \nenhanced the oral bioavailability, with an increase in tenofovir AUC by approximately 40% and Cmax \nby approximately 14%.  Following the first dose of tenofovir disoproxil in fed patients, the median \nCmax in serum ranged from 213 to 375 ng/ml.  However, administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a \nlight meal did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration the steady-state volume of distribution of tenofovir was \nestimated to be approximately 800 ml/kg.  After oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir \nis distributed to most tissues with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidney, liver and the \nintestinal contents (preclinical studies).  In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum \nprotein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to \n25 µg/ml. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the \nCYP450 enzymes.  Moreover, at concentrations substantially higher (approximately 300-fold) than \nthose observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major \nhuman CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2E1, or CYP1A1/2).  Tenofovir disoproxil at a concentration of 100 µmol/l had no effect on any \nof the CYP450 isoforms, except CYP1A1/2, where a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction \nin metabolism of CYP1A1/2 substrate was observed.  Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically \nsignificant interactions involving tenofovir disoproxil and medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 \nwould occur. \n \n\n\n\n117 \n\nElimination \nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system \nwith approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous \nadministration.  Total clearance has been estimated to be approximately 230 ml/h/kg (approximately \n300 ml/min).  Renal clearance has been estimated to be approximately 160 ml/h/kg (approximately \n210 ml/min), which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.  This indicates that active tubular \nsecretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir.  Following oral administration the \nterminal half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. \n \nStudies have established the pathway of active tubular secretion of tenofovir to be influx into proximal \ntubule cell by the human organic anion transporters (hOAT) 1 and 3 and efflux into the urine by the \nmultidrug resistant protein 4 (MRP 4). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were independent of tenofovir disoproxil dose over the dose range \n75 to 600 mg and were not affected by repeated dosing at any dose level. \n \nGender \nLimited data on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in women indicate no major gender effect. \n \nEthnicity \nPharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in different ethnic groups. \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1:  Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 8 HIV-1 infected adolescent \npatients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg and in 23 HIV-1 infected children aged \n2 to < 12 years (see Table 10 below).  Tenofovir exposure achieved in these paediatric patients \nreceiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or 6.5 mg/kg body weight tenofovir \ndisoproxil up to a maximum dose of 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving \nonce-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n \nTable 10: Mean (± SD) tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters by age groups for paediatric \npatients \n \n\nDose and formulation 245 mg film-coated tablet \n12 to < 18 years (n = 8) \n\n6.5 mg/kg granules \n2 to < 12 years (n = 23) \n\nCmax (μg/ml) 0.38 ± 0.13 0.24 ± 0.13 \nAUCtau (μg·h/ml) 3.39 ± 1.22 2.59 ± 1.06 \n\n \nChronic hepatitis B: Steady-state tenofovir exposure in HBV infected adolescent patients \n(12 to < 18 years of age) receiving an oral daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was similar to \nexposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg . \n \nTenofovir exposure in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age receiving an oral daily \ndose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg of body weight (tablet or granules) up to a maximum dose of \n245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age \nreceiving a once daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in children under 2 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose of \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult patients with varying degrees of \nrenal impairment defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function \nwhen CrCl > 80 ml/min; mild with CrCl = 50-79 ml/min; moderate with CrCl = 30-49 ml/min and \nsevere with CrCl = 10-29 ml/min).  Compared with patients with normal renal function, the mean \n\n\n\n118 \n\n(%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng·h/ml in subjects with CrCl > 80 ml/min to \nrespectively 3,064 (30%) ng·h/ml, 6,009 (42%) ng·h/ml and 15,985 (45%) ng·h/ml in patients with \nmild, moderate and severe renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in non-haemodialysis adult patients with creatinine clearance \n< 10 ml/min and in patients with ESRD managed by peritoneal or other forms of dialysis have not \nbeen studied. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in paediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied.  \nNo data are available to make dose recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult \npatients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) \nclassification.  Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic \nimpairment suggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects.  The mean (%CV) \ntenofovir Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/ml and 2,050 (50.8%) ng·h/ml, respectively, \nin normal subjects compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/ml and 2,310 (43.5%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/ml and 2,740 (44.0%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment. \n \nIntracellular pharmacokinetics \nIn non-proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the half-life of tenofovir \ndiphosphate was found to be approximately 50 hours, whereas the half-life in phytohaemagglutinin-\nstimulated PBMCs was found to be approximately 10 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety pharmacology studies reveal no special hazard for humans.  Findings in repeated \ndose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical \nexposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a \ndecrease in serum phosphate concentration.  Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) \nand reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs).  The bone toxicity in young adult rats and \ndogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred \nin juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the \nexposure in patients).  Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-\nrelated decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in BMD. \n \nGenotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results \nin one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat \nhepatocytes.  However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n \nOral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an \nextremely high dose in mice.  These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. \n \nReproductive studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal \nparameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in peri-\npostnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \nThe active substance tenofovir disoproxil and its main transformation products are persistent in the \nenvironment. \n \n \n\n\n\n119 \n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate). \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach tablet contains 164 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nLight blue, almond-shaped, film-coated tablets, of dimensions 16.8 mm x 10.3 mm, debossed on one \nside with “GILEAD” and “4331” and on the other side with “300”. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHIV-1 infection \nViread 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults. \n \nIn adults, the demonstration of the benefit of Viread in HIV-1 infection is based on results of one \nstudy in treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) and \nstudies in which Viread was added to stable background therapy (mainly tritherapy) in antiretroviral \npre-treated patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the majority of \npatients having < 5,000 copies/ml). \n \nViread 245 mg film-coated tablets are also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adolescents, \nwith NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents, aged 12 to < 18 years. \n \nThe choice of Viread to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be based \non individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. \n \nHepatitis B infection \nViread 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with: \n \n• compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum \n\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or \nfibrosis (see section 5.1). \n\n \n• evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n• decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nViread 245 mg film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adolescents \n12 to < 18 years of age with: \n \n\n\n\n122 \n\n• compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication \nand persistently elevated serum ALT levels, or histological evidence of moderate to severe \ninflammation and/or fibrosis.  With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in paediatric \npatients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection and/or \ntreatment of chronic hepatitis B. \n \nPosology \n \nHIV-1 and Chronic hepatitis B \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 35 kg: \nThe recommended dose of Viread for the treatment of HIV or for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B \nis 245 mg (one tablet) once daily taken orally with food. \n \nViread is also available as 33 mg/g granules for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and \nchronic hepatitis B in adults or adolescents for whom a solid dosage form is not appropriate. \n \nThe decision to treat paediatric patients (adolescents) should be based on careful consideration of \nindividual patient needs and with reference to current paediatric treatment guidelines including the \nvalue of baseline histological information.  The benefits of long-term virologic suppression with \ncontinued therapy must be weighed against the risk of prolonged treatment, including the emergence \nof resistant hepatitis B virus and the uncertainties as regards the long term impact of bone and renal \ntoxicity (see section 4.4). \n \nSerum ALT should be persistently elevated for at least 6 months prior to treatment of paediatric \npatients with compensated liver disease due to HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B; and for at least 12 \nmonths in patients with HBeAg negative disease. \n \nDuration of therapy in adult and adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis B \n \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown.  Treatment discontinuation may be considered as \nfollows: \n \n- In HBeAg positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least \n\n12 months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe detection \non two consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) is confirmed or until \nHBs seroconversion or there is loss of efficacy (see section 4.4).  Serum ALT and HBV DNA \nlevels should be followed regularly after treatment discontinuation to detect any late virological \nrelapse. \n\n \n- In HBeAg negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until \n\nHBs seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy.  Treatment discontinuation may \nalso be considered after stable virological suppression is achieved (i.e. for at least 3 years) \nprovided serum ALT and HBV DNA levels are followed regularly after treatment \ndiscontinuation to detect any late virological relapse.  With prolonged treatment for more than \n2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected therapy \nremains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \nIn adult patients with decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment cessation is not \nrecommended. \n \nPaediatric population \nViread is also available as granules for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in \npaediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years and as reduced tablet strengths for the treatment of \n\n\n\n123 \n\nHIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in paediatric patients aged 6 to < 12 years (see section 5.1).  \nPlease refer to the Summaries of Product Characteristics for Viread 33 mg/g granules and Viread \n123 mg, 163 mg and 204 mg film-coated tablets. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected children or children with \nchronic hepatitis B under 2 years of age have not been established.  No data are available. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a patient misses a dose of Viread within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Viread with food as soon as possible and resume their normal dosing schedule.  If a patient \nmisses a dose of Viread by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for their next dose, the patient \nshould not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Viread, another tablet should be taken.  If the patient \nvomits more than 1 hour after taking Viread they do not need to take another dose. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nNo data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years \n(see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nTenofovir is eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to tenofovir increases in patients with \nrenal dysfunction. \n \nAdults \nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in adult patients with \nmoderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) and long-term safety data \nhas not been evaluated for mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min).  Therefore, in \nadult patients with renal impairment tenofovir disoproxil should only be used if the potential benefits \nof treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks.  Administration of Viread 33 mg/g \ngranules to provide a reduced daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil is recommended for adult patients \nwith creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, including haemodialysis patients.  Please refer to the Summary \nof Product Characteristics for Viread 33 mg/g granules. \n \nMild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min) \nLimited data from clinical studies support once daily dosing of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil in patients \nwith mild renal impairment. \n \nModerate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) \nFor patients unable to take the granule formulation of tenofovir disoproxil, prolonged dose intervals \nusing the 245 mg film-coated tablets may be used.  Administration of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil \nevery 48 hours can be used based on modelling of single-dose pharmacokinetic data in HIV negative \nand non-HBV infected subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, including end-stage renal \ndisease requiring haemodialysis, but has not been confirmed in clinical studies.  Therefore, clinical \nresponse to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). \n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and haemodialysis patients \nFor patients unable to take the granule formulation of tenofovir disoproxil and with no alternative \ntreatment available, prolonged dose intervals using the 245 mg film-coated tablets may be used as \nfollows: \n \nSevere renal impairment: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil may be administered every 72-96 hours (dosing \ntwice a week). \n \n\n\n\n124 \n\nHaemodialysis patients: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil may be administered every 7 days following \ncompletion of a haemodialysis session*. \n \nThese dose interval adjustments have not been confirmed in clinical studies.  Simulations suggest that \nthe prolonged dose interval using Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets is not optimal and could result in \nincreased toxicity and possibly inadequate response.  Therefore, clinical response to treatment and \nrenal function should be closely monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n* Generally, once weekly dosing assuming three haemodialysis sessions per week, each of \napproximately 4 hours duration or after 12 hours cumulative haemodialysis. \n \nNo dosing recommendations can be given for non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine clearance \n< 10 ml/min. \n \nPaediatrics \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIf Viread is discontinued in patients with chronic hepatitis B with or without HIV co-infection, these \npatients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \nViread tablets should be taken once daily, orally with food. \n \nA granules formulation of tenofovir disoproxil is available for patients having difficulty in swallowing \nfilm-coated tablets.  However, in exceptional circumstances Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets can be \nadministered following disintegration of the tablet in at least 100 ml of water, orange juice or grape \njuice. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nHIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV infected patients before initiating tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy (see below Co-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B). \n \nHIV-1 \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nHepatitis B \nPatients must be advised that tenofovir disoproxil has not been proven to prevent the risk of \ntransmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.  Appropriate \nprecautions must continue to be used. \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \n\ntenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n- Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see Section 4.5).   \n\n\n\n125 \n\n \nTriple therapy with nucleosides/nucleotides \nThere have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early \nstage in HIV patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well \nas with lamivudine and didanosine as a once-daily regimen. \n \nRenal and bone effects in adult population \nRenal effects \nTenofovir is principally eliminated via the kidney.  Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated \ncreatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been \nreported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil in clinical practice (see section 4.8). \n \nRenal monitoring \nIt is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy with \ntenofovir disoproxil and renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) is also monitored \nafter two to four weeks of treatment, after three months of treatment and every three to six months \nthereafter in patients without renal risk factors.  In patients at risk for renal impairment, a more \nfrequent monitoring of renal function is required. \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 ml/min in \nany adult patient receiving tenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one \nweek, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations \n(see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).  Consideration should also be given to interrupting treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil in adult patients with creatinine clearance decreased to < 50 ml/min or \ndecreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl (0.32 mmol/l).  Interrupting treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other \ncause has been identified. \n \nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, \nvancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2).  If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil and nephrotoxic \nagents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. \n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors \nfor renal dysfunction.  If tenofovir disoproxil is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should \nbe monitored adequately. \n \nA higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil in \ncombination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor.  A close monitoring of renal \nfunction is required in these patients (see section 4.5).  In patients with renal risk factors, the \nco-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully \nevaluated. \n \nTenofovir disoproxil has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which \nare secreted by the same renal pathway, including the transport proteins human organic anion \ntransporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product).  These \nrenal transport proteins may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of \ntenofovir and cidofovir.  Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products, which are \nsecreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 or MRP 4, might be \nmodified if they are co-administered.  Unless clearly necessary, concomitant use of these medicinal \nproducts which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not recommended, but if such use is \nunavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n126 \n\nRenal impairment \nRenal safety with tenofovir disoproxil has only been studied to a very limited degree in adult patients \nwith impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min). \n \nAdult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, including haemodialysis patients: \nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with impaired renal \nfunction.  Therefore, tenofovir disoproxil should only be used if the potential benefits of treatment are \nconsidered to outweigh the potential risks.  In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) and in patients who require haemodialysis use of tenofovir disoproxil is not \nrecommended.  If no alternative treatment is available, the dosing interval must be adjusted and renal \nfunction should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nBone effects \nIn HIV infected patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil \nwith stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve adult patients, \nsmall decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment \ngroups.  Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly \ngreater in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks.  Decreases in BMD of hip were \nsignificantly greater in this group until 96 weeks.  However, there was no increased risk of fractures or \nevidence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks. \n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen \nin patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \ninhibitor.  Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are \nat a high risk for fractures. \n \nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \ntubulopathy (see section 4.8). \n \nIf bone abnormalities are suspected or detected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. \n \nRenal and bone effects in paediatric population \nThere are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity.  Moreover, the \nreversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is \nrecommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide \nthe appropriate monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and \nconsider the need for supplementation. \n \nRenal effects \nRenal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in \nHIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nRenal monitoring \nRenal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to treatment, and \nmonitored during treatment as in adults (see above). \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving \ntenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements \nof blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal \ntubulopathy).  If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist \nshould be obtained to consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil treatment.  Interrupting treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function \nwhen no other cause has been identified. \n \n\n\n\n127 \n\nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \nThe same recommendations apply as in adults (see above). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2).  Tenofovir disoproxil should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal impairment \nand should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy. \n \nBone effects \nViread may cause a reduction in BMD.  The effects of tenofovir disoproxil-associated changes in \nBMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown (see section 5.1). \n \nIf bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with an \nendocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. \n \nLiver disease \nSafety and efficacy data are very limited in liver transplant patients. \n \nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HBV infected patients with \ndecompensated liver disease and who have a Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score > 9.  These patients \nmay be at higher risk of experiencing serious hepatic or renal adverse reactions.  Therefore, \nhepatobiliary and renal parameters should be closely monitored in this patient population. \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis \nFlares on treatment: Spontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are \ncharacterised by transient increases in serum ALT.  After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may \nincrease in some patients (see section 4.8).  In patients with compensated liver disease, these increases \nin serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or \nhepatic decompensation.  Patients with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation \nfollowing hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. \n \nFlares after treatment discontinuation: Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been reported in \npatients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy.  Post-treatment exacerbations are usually \nassociated with rising HBV DNA, and the majority appears to be self-limited.  However, severe \nexacerbations, including fatalities, have been reported.  Hepatic function should be monitored at \nrepeated intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after \ndiscontinuation of hepatitis B therapy.  If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be \nwarranted.  In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not \nrecommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. \n \nLiver flares are especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated liver disease. \n \nCo-infection with hepatitis C or D: There are no data on the efficacy of tenofovir in patients \nco-infected with hepatitis C or D virus. \n \nCo-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B: Due to the risk of development of HIV resistance, tenofovir \ndisoproxil should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients.  Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active \nhepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART) and should be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is \nevidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must \nbe considered.  However, it should be noted that increases of ALT can be part of HBV clearance \nduring therapy with tenofovir, see above Exacerbations of hepatitis. \n \n\n\n\n128 \n\nUse with certain hepatitis C virus antiviral agents \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, \nespecially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).  The safety of tenofovir disoproxil in the setting of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established.  The potential risks and benefits associated with \nco-administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with tenofovir disoproxil given in conjunction with a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, particularly in patients at \nincreased risk of renal dysfunction.  Patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported, particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n\n\n\n129 \n\nElderly \nTenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more \nlikely to have decreased renal function; therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly \npatients with tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nExcipients \n \nViread 245 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate.  Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should \nnot take this medicine. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nBased on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the \npotential for CYP450-mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir \ndisoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nDidanosine \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and \nTable 1). \n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products \nSince tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with \nmedicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport \nproteins hOAT 1, hOAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir \nand/or the co-administered medicinal products. \n \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, \nfoscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). \n \nGiven that tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when it is \nco-administered with tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nOther interactions \nInteractions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below \n(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, and once daily \nas “q.d.”). \n \n\n\n\n130 \n\nTable 1: Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\n(dose in mg) \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, Cmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation \nconcerning \n\nco-administration with \n245 mg tenofovir disoproxil  \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntiretrovirals \nProtease inhibitors \nAtazanavir/Ritonavir \n(300 q.d./100 q.d.) \n\nAtazanavir: \nAUC: ↓ 25% \nCmax: ↓ 28% \nCmin: ↓ 26% \nTenofovir: \nAUC: ↑ 37% \nCmax: ↑ 34% \nCmin: ↑ 29% \n\nNo dose adjustment is \nrecommended.

Animal studies do not \nindicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The use of tenofovir disoproxil may be considered \nduring pregnancy, if necessary. \n \nIn the literature, exposure to tenofovir disoproxil in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to \nreduce the risk of HBV transmission from mother to infant if tenofovir disoproxil is given to mothers, \nin addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine in infants.  \n\nIn three controlled clinical trials, a total of 327 pregnant women with chronic HBV infection were \nadministered tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg) once daily from 28 to 32 weeks gestation through 1 to 2 \nmonths postpartum; women and their infants were followed for up to 12 months after delivery.  No \nsafety signal has emerged from these data. \n\nBreast-feeding \nTenofovir has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the \neffects of tenofovir in newborns/infants.  Therefore Viread should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \nAs a general rule, it is recommended that HIV and HBV infected women do not breast-feed their \ninfants in order to avoid transmission of HIV and HBV to the infant. \n \nFertility \nThere are limited clinical data with respect to the effect of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility.  Animal \nstudies do not indicate harmful effects of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, \npatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil, rare events of renal impairment, \nrenal failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \nsometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have been reported.  \nMonitoring of renal function is recommended for patients receiving Viread (see section 4.4). \n \nHIV-1: Approximately one third of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions following \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  These reactions \nare usually mild to moderate gastrointestinal events.  Approximately 1% of tenofovir \ndisoproxil-treated adult patients discontinued treatment due to the gastrointestinal events. \n \nHepatitis B: Approximately one quarter of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions \nfollowing treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, most of which are mild.  In clinical trials of \nHBV infected patients, the most frequently occurring adverse reaction to tenofovir disoproxil was \nnausea (5.4%). \n \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients on treatment as well as in patients who \nhave discontinued hepatitis B therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nAssessment of adverse reactions for tenofovir disoproxil is based on safety data from clinical studies \nand post-marketing experience.  All adverse reactions are presented in Table 2. \n \nHIV-1 clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on \nexperience in two studies in 653 treatment-experienced patients receiving treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil (n = 443) or placebo (n = 210) in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products \nfor 24 weeks and also in a double-blind comparative controlled study in which 600 treatment-naïve \npatients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 299) or stavudine (n = 301) in \ncombination with lamivudine and efavirenz for 144 weeks. \n \nHepatitis B clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HBV clinical study data is \nprimarily based on experience in two double-blind comparative controlled studies in which 641 adult \npatients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg daily (n = 426) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily (n = 215) for 48 weeks.  The \nadverse reactions observed with continued treatment for 384 weeks were consistent with the safety \nprofile of tenofovir disoproxil.  After an initial decline of approximately -4.9 ml/min (using \nCockcroft-Gault equation) or -3.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (using modification of diet in renal disease \n[MDRD] equation) after the first 4 weeks of treatment, the rate of annual decline post baseline of renal \nfunction reported in tenofovir disoproxil treated patients was -1.41 ml/min per year (using \nCockcroft-Gault equation) and -0.74 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (using MDRD equation). \n \n\n\n\n144 \n\nPatients with decompensated liver disease: The safety profile of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with \ndecompensated liver disease was assessed in a double-blind active controlled study \n(GS-US-174-0108) in which adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or entecavir (n = 22) for 48 weeks. \n \nIn the tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse \nevent; 9% of patients experienced a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl through week 48; there were no statistically significant \ndifferences between the combined tenofovir-containing arms and the entecavir arm.  After 168 weeks, \n16% (7/45) of the tenofovir disoproxil group, 4% (2/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup, and 14% (3/22) of the entecavir group experienced tolerability failure.  Thirteen percent (6/45) \nof the tenofovir disoproxil group, 13% (6/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group, and \n9% (2/22) of the entecavir group had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nAt week 168, in this population of patients with decompensated liver disease, the rate of death was of \n13% (6/45) in the tenofovir disoproxil group, 11% (5/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup and 14% (3/22) in the entecavir group.  The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was 18% (8/45) in \nthe tenofovir disoproxil group, 7% (3/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group and 9% \n(2/22) in the entecavir group. \n \nSubjects with a high baseline CPT score were at higher risk of developing serious adverse events \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B: No new adverse reactions to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified from a randomised, double-blind study (GS-US-174-0121) in which 280 \nlamivudine-resistant patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 141) or \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (n = 139) for 240 weeks. \n \nThe adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment are listed below by \nbody system organ class and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil based on \nclinical study and post-marketing experience \n \nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common: hypophosphataemia1 \nUncommon: hypokalaemia1 \nRare: lactic acidosis \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common: Dizziness \nCommon: Headache \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \nCommon: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, flatulence \nUncommon: Pancreatitis \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nCommon: increased transaminases \nRare: hepatic steatosis, hepatitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common: Rash \nRare: Angioedema \n\n\n\n145 \n\nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nUncommon: rhabdomyolysis1, muscular weakness1 \n\nRare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures)\n1, \n\n2, myopathy1 \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nUncommon: increased creatinine, proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \n\nRare: acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, nephritis (including acute interstitial nephritis)2, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common: Asthenia \nCommon: Fatigue \n1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally \nassociated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical \ntrials or the tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program.  The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and \nthe expanded access program (n = 7,319). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: \nRenal impairment \nAs Viread may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8 Summary of the safety profile).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after \ntenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did \nnot completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of renal \nimpairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients \nreceiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete \nrecovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \nLactic acidosis \nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with \nother antiretrovirals.  Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver \ndisease, or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased \nrisk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal \noutcomes. \n \nHIV-1: \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nHepatitis B: \nExacerbations of hepatitis during treatment \nIn studies with nucleoside-naïve patients, on-treatment ALT elevations > 10 times ULN (upper limit \nof normal) and > 2 times baseline occurred in 2.6% of tenofovir disoproxil-treated patients.  ALT \n\n\n\n146 \n\nelevations had a median time to onset of 8 weeks, resolved with continued treatment, and, in a \nmajority of cases, were associated with a ≥ 2 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load that preceded or \ncoincided with the ALT elevation.  Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HBV infected patients, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred \nafter discontinuation of HBV therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1 \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomised trials (studies GS-US-104-0321 and \nGS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 years) who received \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1).  The adverse reactions observed in paediatric \npatients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those observed in \nclinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary of adverse \nreactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected adolescents, the \nBMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed \nin subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects \nwho switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on \ntheir stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \n(median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse \nevents.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings clinically consistent with proximal renal \ntubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil therapy.  Seven patients had estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Among them, 3 patients \nexperienced a clinically meaningful decline in estimated GFR which improved after discontinuation of \ntenofovir disoproxil. \n \nChronic hepatitis B \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on a randomised study (study GS-US-174-0115) in \n106 adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B receiving treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks and a randomised study (Study \nGS-US-174-0144) in 89 patients with chronic hepatitis B (2 to  < 12 years of age) receiving treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil (n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) for 48 weeks.  The adverse reactions observed in \npaediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those \nobserved in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary of \nadverse reactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been observed in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age.  \nThe BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those \nobserved in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nOther special population(s) \nElderly \nTenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more \nlikely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly \npatients with tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nSince tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended \nin adult patients with renal impairment treated with Viread (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).  The use of \n\n\n\n147 \n\ntenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see sections 4.8 and 5.3), \nand standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \nManagement \nTenofovir can be removed by haemodialysis; the median haemodialysis clearance of tenofovir is \n134 ml/min.  It is not known whether tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AF07 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate is the fumarate salt of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil.  Tenofovir \ndisoproxil is absorbed and converted to the active substance tenofovir, which is a nucleoside \nmonophosphate (nucleotide) analogue.  Tenofovir is then converted to the active metabolite, tenofovir \ndiphosphate, an obligate chain terminator, by constitutively expressed cellular enzymes.  Tenofovir \ndiphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in activated and 50 hours in resting peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and \nthe HBV polymerase by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate \nand, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination.  Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak \ninhibitor of cellular polymerases α, β, and γ.  At concentrations of up to 300 µmol/l, tenofovir has also \nshown no effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or the production of lactic acid in in vitro \nassays. \n \nData pertaining to HIV \nHIV antiviral activity in vitro: The concentration of tenofovir required for 50% inhibition (EC50) of the \nwild-type laboratory strain HIV-1IIIB is 1-6 µmol/l in lymphoid cell lines and 1.1 µmol/l against \nprimary HIV-1 subtype B isolates in PBMCs.  Tenofovir is also active against HIV-1 subtypes A, C, \nD, E, F, G, and O and against HIVBaL in primary monocyte/macrophage cells.  Tenofovir shows \nactivity in vitro against HIV-2, with an EC50 of 4.9 µmol/l in MT-4 cells. \n \nResistance: Strains of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir and a K65R mutation in reverse \ntranscriptase have been selected in vitro and in some patients (see Clinical efficacy and safety).  \nTenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with strains harbouring \nthe K65R mutation (see section 4.4).  In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase \nhas been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. \n \nClinical studies in treatment-experienced patients have assessed the anti-HIV activity of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg against strains of HIV-1 with resistance to nucleoside inhibitors.  The results \nindicate that patients whose HIV expressed 3 or more thymidine-analogue associated mutations \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n148 \n\n(TAMs) that included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced \nresponse to tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg therapy. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe effects of tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults \nhave been demonstrated in trials of 48 weeks and 144 weeks duration, respectively. \n \nIn study GS-99-907, 550 treatment-experienced adult patients were treated with placebo or tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg for 24 weeks.  The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 427 cells/mm3, the mean \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 3.4 log10 copies/ml (78% of patients had a viral load of \n< 5,000 copies/ml) and the mean duration of prior HIV treatment was 5.4 years.  Baseline genotypic \nanalysis of HIV isolates from 253 patients revealed that 94% of patients had HIV-1 resistance \nmutations associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 58% had mutations associated \nwith protease inhibitors and 48% had mutations associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. \n \nAt week 24 the time-weighted average change from baseline in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \n(DAVG24) was -0.03 log10 copies/ml and -0.61 log10 copies/ml for the placebo and tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg recipients (p < 0.0001).  A statistically significant difference in favour of tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg was seen in the time-weighted average change from baseline at week 24 (DAVG24) for CD4 \ncount (+13 cells/mm3 for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus -11 cells/mm3 for placebo, \np-value = 0.0008).  The antiviral response to tenofovir disoproxil was durable through 48 weeks \n(DAVG48 was -0.57 log10 copies/ml, proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 or \n50 copies/ml was 41% and 18% respectively).  Eight (2%) tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg treated patients \ndeveloped the K65R mutation within the first 48 weeks. \n \nThe 144-week, double-blind, active controlled phase of study GS-99-903 evaluated the efficacy and \nsafety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus stavudine when used in combination with lamivudine and \nefavirenz in HIV-1 infected adult patients naïve to antiretroviral therapy.  The mean baseline CD4 cell \ncount was 279 cells/mm3, the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.91 log10 copies/ml, 19% of \npatients had symptomatic HIV-1 infection and 18% had AIDS.  Patients were stratified by baseline \nHIV-1 RNA and CD4 count.  Forty-three percent of patients had baseline viral loads \n> 100,000 copies/ml and 39% had CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/ml. \n \nBy intent to treat analysis (missing data and switch in antiretroviral therapy (ART) considered as \nfailure), the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml at \n48 weeks of treatment was 80% and 76% respectively in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, \ncompared to 84% and 80% in the stavudine arm.  At 144 weeks, the proportion of patients with \nHIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml was 71% and 68% respectively in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg arm, compared to 64% and 63% in the stavudine arm. \n \nThe average change from baseline for HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count at 48 weeks of treatment was \nsimilar in both treatment groups (-3.09 and -3.09 log10 copies/ml; +169 and 167 cells/mm3 in the \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine groups, respectively).  At 144 weeks of treatment, the \naverage change from baseline remained similar in both treatment groups (-3.07 and \n-3.03 log10 copies/ml; +263 and +283 cells/mm3 in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine \ngroups, respectively).  A consistent response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was seen \nregardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count. \n \nThe K65R mutation occurred in a slightly higher percentage of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than the active control group (2.7% versus 0.7%).  Efavirenz or lamivudine resistance either \npreceded or was coincident with the development of K65R in all cases.  Eight patients had HIV that \nexpressed K65R in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, 7 of these occurred during the first 48 weeks \nof treatment and the last one at week 96.  No further K65R development was observed up to \nweek 144.  One patient in the tenofovir disoproxil arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus.  \nFrom both the genotypic and phenotypic analyses there was no evidence for other pathways of \nresistance to tenofovir. \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \nData pertaining to HBV \nHBV antiviral activity in vitro: The in vitro antiviral activity of tenofovir against HBV was assessed in \nthe HepG2 2.2.15 cell line.  The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.14 to 1.5 µmol/l, with \nCC50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) values > 100 µmol/l. \n \nResistance: No HBV mutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil resistance have been identified \n(see Clinical efficacy and safety).  In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, \nrtL180M, and rtM204I/V mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine showed a \nsusceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild-type virus.  HBV strains \nexpressing the rtL180M, rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V and rtM250V mutations associated with \nresistance to entecavir showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of wild-\ntype virus.  HBV strains expressing the adefovir-associated resistance mutations rtA181V and \nrtN236T showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild-type virus.  \nViruses containing the rtA181T mutation remained susceptible to tenofovir with EC50 values 1.5-fold \nthat of wild-type virus. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe demonstration of benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in compensated and decompensated disease is \nbased on virological, biochemical and serological responses in adults with HBeAg positive and \nHBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B.  Treated patients included those who were treatment-naïve, \nlamivudine-experienced, adefovir dipivoxil-experienced and patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir \ndipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  Benefit has also been demonstrated based on histological \nresponses in compensated patients. \n \nExperience in patients with compensated liver disease at 48 weeks (studies GS-US-174-0102 and \nGS-US-174-0103) \nResults through 48 weeks from two randomised, phase 3 double-blind studies comparing tenofovir \ndisoproxil to adefovir dipivoxil in adult patients with compensated liver disease are presented in \nTable 3 below.  Study GS-US-174-0103 was conducted in 266 (randomised and treated) \nHBeAg positive patients while study GS-US-174-0102 was conducted in 375 (randomised and treated) \npatients negative for HBeAg and positive for HBeAb. \n \nIn both of these studies tenofovir disoproxil was significantly superior to adefovir dipivoxil for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint of complete response (defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis).  Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was also associated with significantly greater \nproportions of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, when compared to adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg \ntreatment.  Both treatments produced similar results with regard to histological response (defined as \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis) at week 48 (see Table 3 below). \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0103 a significantly greater proportion of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than in the adefovir dipivoxil group had normalised ALT and achieved HBsAg loss at week 48 \n(see Table 3 below). \n \nTable 3: Efficacy parameters in compensated HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients at \nweek 48 \n \n Study 174-0102 (HBeAg negative) Study 174-0103 (HBeAg positive) \nParameter Tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg  \nn = 250 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \n\nn = 125 \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg  \n\nn = 176 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \nn = 90 \n\nComplete \nresponse (%)a \n\n71* 49 67* 12 \n\nHistology     \nHistological response \n(%)b \n\n72 \n \n\n69 74 68 \n\n\n\n150 \n\n Study 174-0102 (HBeAg negative) Study 174-0103 (HBeAg positive) \nParameter Tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg  \nn = 250 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \n\nn = 125 \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg  \n\nn = 176 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \nn = 90 \n\nMedian HBV DNA \nreduction from \nbaselinec \n(log10 copies/ml) \n\n-4.7* -4.0 -6.4* -3.7 \n\nHBV DNA (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \n(< 69 IU/ml) \n\n \n93* \n\n \n63 \n\n \n76* \n\n \n13 \n\nALT (%) \nNormalised ALTd \n\n \n76 \n\n \n77 \n\n \n68* \n\n \n54 \n\nSerology (%) \nHBeAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n \nn/a \n\n \nn/a \n\n \n22/21 \n\n \n18/18 \n\nHBsAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n0/0 0/0 3*/1 0/0 \n\n* p-value versus adefovir dipivoxil < 0.05. \na Complete response defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at \nleast 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nb Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nc Median change from baseline HBV DNA merely reflects the difference between baseline HBV DNA and the limit of \ndetection (LOD) of the assay. \nd The population used for analysis of ALT normalisation included only patients with ALT above ULN at baseline. \nn/a = not applicable. \n \nTenofovir disoproxil was associated with significantly greater proportions of patients with \nundetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche Cobas \nTaqman HBV assay), when compared to adefovir dipivoxil (study GS-US-174-0102; 91%, 56% and \nstudy GS-US-174-0103; 69%, 9%), respectively. \n \nResponse to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleoside-experienced (n = 51) \nand nucleoside-naïve (n = 375) patients and in patients with normal ALT (n = 21) and abnormal ALT \n(n = 405) at baseline when studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were combined.  \nForty-nine of the 51 nucleoside-experienced patients were previously treated with lamivudine.  \nSeventy-three percent of nucleoside-experienced and 69% of nucleoside-naïve patients achieved \ncomplete response to treatment; 90% of nucleoside-experienced and 88% of nucleoside-naïve patients \nachieved HBV DNA suppression < 400 copies/ml.

Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg  was associated \nwith a mean change in serum HBV DNA from baseline, in the patients for whom there was 48-week \ndata, of -5.74 log10 copies/ml (n = 18).  In addition, 61% of patients had normal ALT at week 48. \n \nExperience in patients with persistent viral replication (study GS-US-174-0106) \nThe efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg plus 200 mg \nemtricitabine has been evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study (study GS-US-174-0106), in \nHBeAg positive and HBeAg negative adult patients who had persistent viraemia \n(HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 copies/ml) while receiving adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg for more than 24 weeks.  At \nbaseline, 57% of patients randomised to tenofovir disoproxil versus 60% of patients randomised to \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment group had previously been treated with lamivudine.  \nOverall at week 24, treatment with tenofovir disoproxil resulted in 66% (35/53) of patients with \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (< 69 IU/ml) versus 69% (36/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.672).  In addition 55% (29/53) of patients treated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil had undetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of \nthe Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV assay) versus 60% (31/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.504).  Comparisons between treatment groups beyond week 24 are difficult \nto interpret since investigators had the option to intensify treatment to open-label emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil.  Long-term studies to evaluate the benefit/risk of bitherapy with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil in HBV monoinfected patients are ongoing. \n \nExperience in patients with decompensated liver disease at 48 weeks (study GS-US-174-0108) \nStudy GS-US-174-0108 is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled study evaluating the safety \nand efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), and \n\n\n\n153 \n\nentecavir (n = 22), in patients with decompensated liver disease.  In the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \narm, patients had a mean CPT score of 7.2, mean HBV DNA of 5.8 log10 copies/ml and mean serum \nALT of 61 U/l at baseline.  Forty-two percent (19/45) of patients had at least 6 months of prior \nlamivudine experience, 20% (9/45) of patients had prior adefovir dipivoxil experience and 9 of \n45 patients (20%) had lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  The \nco-primary safety endpoints were discontinuation due to an adverse event and confirmed increase in \nserum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nIn patients with CPT scores ≤ 9, 74% (29/39) of tenofovir disoproxil, and 94% (33/35) of \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment groups achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml after \n48 weeks of treatment. \n \nOverall, the data derived from this study are too limited to draw any definitive conclusions on the \ncomparison of emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil versus tenofovir disoproxil, (see Table 7 below). \n \nTable 7: Safety and efficacy parameters in decompensated patients at week 48 \n \n Study 174-0108 \nParameter Tenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEmtricitabine 200 mg/ \ntenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEntecavir \n(0.5 mg or 1 mg) \n\nn = 22 \n\nTolerability failure \n(permanent \ndiscontinuation of study \ndrug due to a treatment \nemergent AE) \nn (%)a \n\n3 (7%) 2 (4%) 2 (9%) \n\nConfirmed increase in \nserum creatinine \n≥ 0.5 mg/dl from \nbaseline or confirmed \nserum phosphate of \n< 2 mg/dl \nn (%)b \n\n4 (9%) 3 (7%) 1 (5%) \n\nHBV DNA n (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \nn (%) \n\n31/44 (70%) 36/41 (88%) 16/22 (73%) \n\nALT n (%) \nNormal ALT \n\n25/44 (57%) 31/41 (76%) 12/22 (55%) \n\n≥ 2 point decrease in \nCPT from baseline \nn (%) \n\n7/27 (26%) 12/25 (48%) 5/12 (42%) \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in CPT score \n\n-0.8 -0.9 -1.3 \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in MELD score \n\n-1.8 -2.3 -2.6 \n\na p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 0.622, \nb p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 1.000. \n \nExperience beyond 48 weeks in study GS-US-174-0108 \nUsing a noncompleter/switch = failure analysis, 50% (21/42) of subjects receiving tenofovir \ndisoproxil, 76% (28/37) of subjects receiving emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil and 52% (11/21) \nof subjects receiving entecavir achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 168. \n \nExperience in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV at 240 weeks (study GS-US-174-0121) \nThe efficacy and safety of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind \nstudy (GS-US-174-0121) in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n = 280) with \ncompensated liver disease, viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 IU/ml), and genotypic evidence of \nlamivudine resistance (rtM204I/V +/- rtL180M).  Only five had adefovir-associated resistance \n\n\n\n154 \n\nmutations at baseline.  One hundred forty-one and 139 adult subjects were randomised to a tenofovir \ndisoproxil and emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, respectively.  Baseline \ndemographics were similar between the two treatment arms: At baseline, 52.5% of subjects were \nHBeAg negative, 47.5% were HBeAg positive, mean HBV DNA level was 6.5 log10 copies/ml, and \nmean ALT was 79 U/l, respectively. \n \nAfter 240 weeks of treatment, 117 of 141 subjects (83%) randomised to tenofovir disoproxil had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 51 of 79 subjects (65%) had ALT normalisation.  After 240 weeks of \ntreatment with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 115 of 139 subjects (83%) had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 59 of 83 subjects (71%) had ALT normalisation.  Among the \nHBeAg positive subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil, 16 of 65 subjects (25%) experienced \nHBeAg loss, and 8 of 65 subjects (12%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through week 240.

Two subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss by \nWeek 240, but not seroconversion to anti-HBs.  Five subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss, with 2 of these 5 subjects experiencing seroconversion \nto anti-HBs. \n \nClinical resistance \nFour hundred and twenty-six HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 250) and HBeAg positive \n(GS-US-174-0103, n = 176) patients initially randomised to double-blind tenofovir disoproxil \ntreatment and then switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic \nchanges in HBV polymerase from baseline.  Genotypic evaluations performed on all patients with \nHBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 39), 96 (n = 24), 144 (n = 6), 192 (n = 5), 240 (n = 4), 288 \n(n = 6) and 384 (n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no mutations associated with \ntenofovir disoproxil resistance have developed. \n \nTwo hundred and fifteen HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 125) and HBeAg positive \n(GS-US-174-0103, n = 90) patients initially randomised to double-blind adefovir dipivoxil treatment \nand then switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic changes \nin HBV polymerase from baseline.  Genotypic evaluations performed on all patients with \nHBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 16), 96 (n = 5), 144 (n = 1), 192 (n = 2), 240 (n = 1), 288 \n(n = 1) and 384 (n = 2) of tenofovir disoproxil monotherapy showed that no mutations associated with \ntenofovir disoproxil resistance have developed. \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0108, 45 patients (including 9 patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil \nresistance mutations at baseline) received tenofovir disoproxil for up to 168 weeks.  Genotypic data \nfrom paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 6/8 patients with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified in these isolates.  Genotypic analysis was conducted for 5 subjects in the \ntenofovir disoproxil arm post week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil resistance were detected in any subject. \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0121, 141 patients with lamivudine resistance substitutions at baseline received \ntenofovir disoproxil for up to 240 weeks.  Cumulatively, there were 4 patients who experienced a \nviremic episode (HBV DNA>400 copies/ml) at their last timepoint on tenofovir disoproxil.  Among \nthem, sequence data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 2 of 4 \npatients.  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified \nin these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0115), 52 patients (including 6 patients with lamivudine resistance \nmutations at baseline) initially received blinded tenofovir disoproxil for up to 72 weeks and then \n51/52 patients switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil (tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup).  Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 6), week 72 (n = 5), week 96 (n = 4), week 144 (n = 2), and week 192 \n(n = 3).  Fifty-four patients (including 2 patients with lamivudine resistance mutations at baseline) \n\n\n\n155 \n\ninitially received blinded placebo treatment for 72 weeks, and 52/54 patients followed with tenofovir \ndisoproxil (PLB-tenofovir disoproxil group).  Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients \nwithin this group with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 96 (n = 17), week 144 (n = 7), and \nweek 192 (n = 8).  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were \nidentified in these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0144), genotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV \nisolates from patients who received tenofovir disoproxil were available for 9 of 10 patients who had \nplasma HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml. No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to \ntenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates by week 48. \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years \nof age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an \noptimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of \ntenofovir disoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at \nweek 24.  However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult \ndata and comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine \nBMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, \nrespectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and \n-0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the \ntenofovir disoproxil and placebo groups, respectively.  The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group compared to the placebo group.  At week 48, six adolescents in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group and one adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD \nloss (defined as > 4% loss).  Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil, BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, \nvirologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either \nreplace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original \nregimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.  At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA \nconcentrations < 400 copies/ml.  The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained \n< 400 copies/ml at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group.  When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment \ngroup had HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/ml at week 48. \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In patients who received treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and \n-0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean \nchanges at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, \nand -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or \nzidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar \nbetween the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  \nTotal body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine \nor zidovudine treatment group.  One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or \nzidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  \nBMD Z-scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who \nwere treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks.  BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and \nweight. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \ndiscontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings \n\n\n\n156 \n\nclinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil \ntherapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). \n \nChronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients \naged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, elevated serum ALT \n(≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 months] were treated with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks.  Subjects must have been naïve \nto tenofovir disoproxil, but could have received interferon based regimens (> 6 months prior to \nscreening) or any other non-tenofovir disoproxil containing oral anti-HBV nucleoside/nucleotide \ntherapy (> 16 weeks prior to screening).  At week 72, overall 88% (46/52) of patients in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment group and 0% (0/54) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-four percent (26/35) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had \nnormalised ALT at week 72 compared to 31% (13/42) in the placebo group.  Response to treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleos(t)ide-naïve (n = 20) and nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced (n = 32) patients, including lamivudine-resistant patients (n = 6).  Ninety-five percent of \nnucleos(t)ide-naïve patients, 84% of nucleos(t)ide-experienced patients, and 83% of lamivudine-\nresistant patients achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 72.  Thirty-one of the 32 nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced patients had prior lamivudine experience.  At week 72, 96% (27/28) of immune-active \npatients (HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, serum ALT > 1.5 x ULN) in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 0% (0/32) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-five \npercent (21/28) of immune-active patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normal ALT at \nweek 72 compared to 34% (11/32) in the placebo group. \n \nAfter 72 weeks of blinded randomized treatment, each subject could switch to open-label tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment up to week 192.  After week 72, virologic suppression was maintained for those \nreceiving double-blind tenofovir disoproxil followed by open-label tenofovir disoproxil (tenofovir \ndisoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil group): 86.5% (45/52) of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir \ndisoproxil group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 192.  Among the subjects who received \nplacebo during the double-blind period, the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL \nrose sharply after they began treatment with open-label tenofovir disoproxil (PLB- tenofovir \ndisoproxil group): 74.1% (40/54) of subjects in the PLB-tenofovir disoproxil group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml at week 192.  The proportion of subjects with ALT normalization at week 192 in the \ntenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil group was 75.8% (25/33) among those who were HBeAg \npositive at baseline and 100.0% (2 of 2 subjects) among those who were HBeAg negative at baseline.  \nSimilar percentages of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil and PLB-tenofovir \ndisoproxil groups (37.5% and 41.7%, respectively) experienced seroconversion to anti-HBe through \nweek 192. \n \nBone Mineral Density (BMD) data from Study GS-US-174-0115 are summarized in Table 8: \n \nTable 8: Bone Mineral Density Evaluation at Baseline, Week 72 and 192 \n \n\n \n\nBaseline Week 72 Week 192 \nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nLumbar spine \nmean (SD) \nBMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.42  \n(0.762) \n\n-0.26  \n(0.806) \n\n-0.49  \n(0.852)  \n\n-0.23 \n(0.893)  -0.37 (0.946)  \n\n-0.44 \n(0.920)  \n\nLumbar spine \nmean (SD) \nchange from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA -0.06  (0.320) \n0.10  \n\n(0.378) \n0.02  \n\n(0.548) \n-0.10 \n\n(0.543) \n\nWhole body mean \n(SD) \nBMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.19  \n(1.110) \n\n−0.23 \n(0.859) \n\n−0.36 \n (1.077) \n\n−0.12 \n(0.916) −0.38 (0.934) \n\n−0.42 \n (0.942) \n\n\n\n157 \n\n \n\nBaseline Week 72 Week 192 \nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nWhole body mean \n(SD) change from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA −0.16 (0.355) 0.09 (0.349) \n-0.16 \n\n(0.521) \n-0.19  \n\n(0.504) \n\nLumbar spine \nBMD at least 6% \ndecreaseb \n\nNA NA 1.9% (1 subject) 0% \n3.8% \n\n(2 subjects) \n3.7% \n\n(2 subjects) \n\nWhole body \nBMD at least 6% \ndecreaseb \n\nNA NA 0% 0% 0% 1.9% (1 subject) \n\nLumbar spine \nBMD mean % \nincrease \n\nNA NA 5.14% 8.08% 10.05% 11.21% \n\nWhole body \nBMD mean % \nincrease \n\nNA NA 3.07% 5.39% 6.09% 7.22% \n\nNA = Not Applicable \na BMD Z-scores not adjusted for height and weight \nb Primary safety endpoint through week 72 \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0144, 89 HBeAg-negative and -positive patients aged 2 to < 12 years with \nchronic hepatitis B were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 245 mg \n(n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) once daily for 48 weeks. Subjects must have been naïve to tenofovir \ndisoproxil, with HBV DNA > 105 copies/mL (~ 4.2 log10 IU/mL) and ALT >1.5 × the upper limit of \nnormal (ULN) at screening.  At Week 48, 77% (46 of 60) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ntreatment group and 7% (2 of 29) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL \n(69 IU/mL). Sixty-six percent (38 of 58) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normalized \nALT at week 48 compared with 15% (4 of 27) in the placebo group.

Administration of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil \nwith a meal to HIV infected patients resulted in mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values of \n326 (36.6%) ng/ml, 3,324 (41.2%) ng·h/ml and 64.4 (39.4%) ng/ml, respectively.  Maximum tenofovir \nconcentrations are observed in serum within one hour of dosing in the fasted state and within two \nhours when taken with food.  The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted \npatients was approximately 25%.  Administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a high fat meal \nenhanced the oral bioavailability, with an increase in tenofovir AUC by approximately 40% and Cmax \nby approximately 14%.  Following the first dose of tenofovir disoproxil in fed patients, the median \nCmax in serum ranged from 213 to 375 ng/ml.  However, administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a \nlight meal did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration the steady-state volume of distribution of tenofovir was \nestimated to be approximately 800 ml/kg.  After oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir \nis distributed to most tissues with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidney, liver and the \nintestinal contents (preclinical studies).  In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum \nprotein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to \n25 µg/ml. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the \nCYP450 enzymes.  Moreover, at concentrations substantially higher (approximately 300-fold) than \nthose observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major \nhuman CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2E1, or CYP1A1/2).  Tenofovir disoproxil at a concentration of 100 µmol/l had no effect on any \n\n\n\n159 \n\nof the CYP450 isoforms, except CYP1A1/2, where a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction \nin metabolism of CYP1A1/2 substrate was observed.  Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically \nsignificant interactions involving tenofovir disoproxil and medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 \nwould occur. \n \nElimination \nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system \nwith approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous \nadministration.  Total clearance has been estimated to be approximately 230 ml/h/kg (approximately \n300 ml/min).  Renal clearance has been estimated to be approximately 160 ml/h/kg (approximately \n210 ml/min), which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.  This indicates that active tubular \nsecretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir.  Following oral administration the \nterminal half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. \n \nStudies have established the pathway of active tubular secretion of tenofovir to be influx into proximal \ntubule cell by the human organic anion transporters (hOAT) 1 and 3 and efflux into the urine by the \nmultidrug resistant protein 4 (MRP 4). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were independent of tenofovir disoproxil dose over the dose range \n75 to 600 mg and were not affected by repeated dosing at any dose level. \n \nAge \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in the elderly (over 65 years of age). \n \nGender \nLimited data on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in women indicate no major gender effect. \n \nEthnicity \nPharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in different ethnic groups. \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1: Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 8 HIV-1 infected adolescent \npatients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg.  Mean (± SD) Cmax and AUCtau are \n0.38 ± 0.13 μg/ml and 3.39 ± 1.22 μg·h/ml, respectively.  Tenofovir exposure achieved in adolescent \npatients receiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in \nadults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n \nChronic hepatitis B: Steady-state tenofovir exposure in HBV infected adolescent patients \n(12 to < 18 years of age) receiving an oral daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was similar to \nexposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n \nTenofovir exposure in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age receiving an oral daily \ndose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg of body weight (tablet or granules) up to a maximum dose of \n245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age \nreceiving a once daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg tablets in children \nunder 12 years or with renal impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose of \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult patients with varying degrees of \nrenal impairment defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function \nwhen CrCl > 80 ml/min; mild with CrCl = 50-79 ml/min; moderate with CrCl = 30-49 ml/min and \nsevere with CrCl = 10-29 ml/min).  Compared with patients with normal renal function, the mean \n\n\n\n160 \n\n(%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng·h/ml in subjects with CrCl > 80 ml/min to \nrespectively 3,064 (30%) ng·h/ml, 6,009 (42%) ng·h/ml and 15,985 (45%) ng·h/ml in patients with \nmild, moderate and severe renal impairment.  The dosing recommendations in patients with renal \nimpairment, with increased dosing interval, are expected to result in higher peak plasma \nconcentrations and lower Cmin levels in patients with renal impairment compared with patients with \nnormal renal function.  The clinical implications of this are unknown. \n \nIn patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl < 10 ml/min) requiring haemodialysis, between \ndialysis tenofovir concentrations substantially increased over 48 hours achieving a mean Cmax of \n1,032 ng/ml and a mean AUC0-48h of 42,857 ng·h/ml. \n \nIt is recommended that the dosing interval for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg is modified in adult patients \nwith creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min or in patients who already have ESRD and require dialysis \n(see section 4.2). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine clearance \n< 10 ml/min and in patients with ESRD managed by peritoneal or other forms of dialysis have not \nbeen studied. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in paediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied.  \nNo data are available to make dose recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult \npatients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) \nclassification.  Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic \nimpairment suggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects.  The mean (%CV) \ntenofovir Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/ml and 2,050 (50.8%) ng·h/ml, respectively, \nin normal subjects compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/ml and 2,310 (43.5%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/ml and 2,740 (44.0%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment. \n \nIntracellular pharmacokinetics \nIn non-proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the half-life of tenofovir \ndiphosphate was found to be approximately 50 hours, whereas the half-life in phytohaemagglutinin-\nstimulated PBMCs was found to be approximately 10 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety pharmacology studies reveal no special hazard for humans.  Findings in repeated \ndose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical \nexposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a \ndecrease in serum phosphate concentration.  Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) \nand reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs).  The bone toxicity in young adult rats and \ndogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred \nin juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the \nexposure in patients).  Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-\nrelated decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in BMD. \n \nGenotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results \nin one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat \nhepatocytes.  However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n \nOral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an \nextremely high dose in mice.  These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. \n \n\n\n\n161 \n\nReproductive studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal \nparameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in peri-\npostnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \nThe active substance tenofovir disoproxil and its main transformation products are persistent in the \nenvironment. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nViread 33 mg/g granules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach scoop delivers one gram of granules which contains 33 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate). \n \nExcipient with known effect \nOne gram of granules contains 622 mg mannitol. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGranules. \n \nWhite, taste masked, coated granules. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHIV-1 infection \nViread 33 mg/g granules are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for \nthe treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the \nuse of first line agents, from 2 to < 6 years of age, and above 6 years of age for whom a solid dosage \nform is not appropriate. \n \nViread 33 mg/g granules are also indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products \nfor the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults for whom a solid dosage form is not appropriate. \n \nIn adults, the demonstration of the benefit of Viread in HIV-1 infection is based on results of one \nstudy in treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) and \nstudies in which Viread was added to stable background therapy (mainly tritherapy) in antiretroviral \npre-treated patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the majority of \npatients having < 5,000 copies/ml). \n \nThe choice of Viread to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be based \non individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. \n \nHepatitis B infection \nViread 33 mg/g granules are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults for whom a \nsolid dosage form is not appropriate with: \n \n• compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum \n\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or \nfibrosis (see section 5.1). \n\n \n• evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n• decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n164 \n\nViread 33 mg/g granules are also indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in paediatric \npatients2 to < 18 years of age for whom a solid dosage form is not appropriate with: \n \n• compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication, \n\nand persistently elevated serum ALT levels, or histological evidence of moderate to severe \ninflammation and/or fibrosis.  With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in paediatric \npatients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection and/or \ntreatment of chronic hepatitis B. \n \nPosology \n \nHIV-1 and Chronic hepatitis B \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 35 kg: \nThe recommended dose of Viread for the treatment of HIV or for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B \nis 245 mg, equivalent to 7.5 scoops of granules, once daily taken orally with food. \n \nViread is also available as 245 mg film-coated tablets for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and \nchronic hepatitis B in adults and adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years who weigh ≥ 35 kg. \n \nChildren aged 2 to < 12 years: \nThe recommended dose is 6.5 mg of tenofovir disoproxil per kilogram of body weight once daily \ntaken with food.  Refer to Table 1. \n \nLimited clinical data are available at the 6.5 mg/kg dose of the granules.  Therefore, close monitoring \nof efficacy and safety is needed. \n \nTable 1: Dosing for children aged 2 to < 12 years \n \n\nBody weight (kg) Once daily \nScoops of granules \n\nTotal dose (mg) tenofovir \ndisoproxil  \n\n10 to < 12 2 65 \n12 to < 14 2.5 82 \n14 to < 17 3 98 \n17 to < 19 3.5 114 \n19 to < 22 4 131 \n22 to < 24 4.5 147 \n24 to < 27 5 163 \n27 to < 29 5.5 180 \n29 to < 32 6 196 \n32 to < 34 6.5 212 \n34 to < 35 7 229 \n\n≥ 35 7.5 245 \n \nViread is also available as 123 mg, 163 mg, 204 mg film-coated tablets for the treatment of \nHIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B in paediatric patients aged 6 to < 12 years who weigh ≥ 17 \nand < 35 kg for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate.  Please refer to the Summaries of Product \nCharacteristics for these medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n165 \n\nThe decision to treat paediatric patients (adolescents and children) should be based on careful \nconsideration of individual patient needs and with reference to current paediatric treatment guidelines \nincluding the value of baseline histological information.  The benefits of long-term virologic \nsuppression with continued therapy must be weighed against the risk of prolonged treatment, including \nthe emergence of resistant hepatitis B virus and the uncertainties as regards the long term impact of \nbone and renal toxicity (see section 4.4). \n \nSerum ALT should be persistently elevated for at least 6 months prior to treatment of paediatric \npatients with compensated liver disease due to HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B; and for at least 12 \nmonths in patients with HBeAg negative disease. \n \nDuration of therapy in adults and paediatric patients with chronic hepatitis B \n \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown.  Treatment discontinuation may be considered as \nfollows: \n \n- In HBeAg positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least \n\n12 months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe detection \non two consecutive serum samples at least 3-6 months apart) is confirmed or until \nHBs seroconversion or there is loss of efficacy (see section 4.4).  Serum ALT and HBV DNA \nlevels should be followed regularly after treatment discontinuation to detect any late virological \nrelapse. \n\n \n- In HBeAg negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until \n\nHBs seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy.  Treatment discontinuation may \nalso be considered after stable virological suppression is achieved (i.e. for at least 3 years) \nprovided serum ALT and HBV DNA levels are followed regularly after treatment \ndiscontinuation to detect any late virological relapse. With prolonged treatment for more than \n2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected therapy \nremains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \nIn adult patients with decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment cessation is not \nrecommended. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a patient misses a dose of Viread within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Viread with food as soon as possible and resume their normal dosing schedule.  If a patient \nmisses a dose of Viread by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for their next dose, the patient \nshould not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Viread, another dose should be taken.  If the patient \nvomits more than 1 hour after taking Viread they do not need to take another dose. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nNo data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years \n(see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nTenofovir is eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to tenofovir increases in patients with \nrenal dysfunction. \n \nAdults \nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in adult patients with \nmoderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) and long-term safety data \nhas not been evaluated for mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min).  Therefore, in \nadult patients with renal impairment tenofovir disoproxil should only be used if the potential benefits \n\n\n\n166 \n\nof treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks.  Dose adjustments using tenofovir \ndisoproxil 33 mg/g granules are recommended for patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min. \n \nMild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min) \nLimited data from clinical studies support once daily dosing of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil, \nequivalent to 7.5 scoops of granules, in patients with mild renal impairment. \n \nAdjustments of the daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 33 mg/g granules are recommended in patients \nwith moderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) or severe (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) renal \nimpairment based on modelling of single-dose pharmacokinetic data in HIV negative and \nnon-HBV infected subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, including end-stage renal \ndisease requiring haemodialysis.  These pharmacokinetic modelling data have not been confirmed in \nclinical studies.  Therefore, clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely \nmonitored in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nModerate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) \nAdministration of 132 mg (4 scoops) tenofovir disoproxil 33 mg/g granules once daily is \nrecommended. \n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and haemodialysis patients \nFor patients with creatinine clearance 20-29 ml/min: Administration of 65 mg (2 scoops) tenofovir \ndisoproxil 33 mg/g granules once daily is recommended. \n \nFor patients with creatinine clearance 10-19 ml/min: Administration of 33 mg (1 scoop) tenofovir \ndisoproxil 33 mg/g granules once daily is recommended. \n \nHaemodialysis patients: 16.5 mg (0.5 scoop) tenofovir disoproxil 33 mg/g granules may be \nadministered following completion of each 4-hour haemodialysis session. \n \nThese dose adjustments have not been confirmed in clinical studies.  Therefore, clinical response to \ntreatment and renal function should be closely monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nNo dosing recommendations can be given for non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine clearance \n< 10 ml/min. \n \nPaediatric patients \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIf Viread is discontinued in patients with chronic hepatitis B with or without HIV co-infection, these \npatients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected children or children with \nchronic hepatitis B under 2 years of age have not been established.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nViread granules should be measured with the supplied dosing scoop.  One level scoop delivers 1 g of \ngranules which contains 33 mg of tenofovir disoproxil.  Viread granules should be mixed in a \ncontainer with soft food not requiring chewing, for example yoghurt, applesauce or baby food.  One \ntablespoon (15 ml) of soft food per one level scoop of granules is required.  The entire mixture should \nbe ingested immediately.  Viread granules must not be mixed with liquids. \n \nViread should be taken once daily, orally with food. \n\n\n\n167 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nHIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV infected patients before initiating tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy (see below Co-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B). \n \nHIV-1 \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nHepatitis B \nPatients must be advised that tenofovir disoproxil has not been proven to prevent the risk of \ntransmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.  Appropriate \nprecautions must continue to be used. \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \n\ntenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n- Viread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n- Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see Section 4.5).   \n \nTriple therapy with nucleosides/nucleotides \nThere have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early \nstage in HIV patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well \nas with lamivudine and didanosine as a once-daily regimen. \n \nRenal and bone effects in adult population \nRenal effects \nTenofovir is principally eliminated via the kidney.  Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated \ncreatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been \nreported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil in clinical practice (see section 4.8). \n \nRenal monitoring \nIt is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy with \ntenofovir disoproxil and renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) is also monitored \nafter two to four weeks of treatment, after three months of treatment and every three to six months \nthereafter in patients without renal risk factors.  In patients at risk for renal impairment, a more \nfrequent monitoring of renal function is required. \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 ml/min in \nany adult patient receiving tenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one \nweek, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations \n(see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).  Consideration should also be given to interrupting treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil in adult patients with creatinine clearance decreased to < 50 ml/min or \ndecreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl (0.32 mmol/l).  Interrupting treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other \ncause has been identified. \n \n\n\n\n168 \n\nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, \nvancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2).  If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil and nephrotoxic \nagents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. \n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors \nfor renal dysfunction.  If tenofovir disoproxil is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should \nbe monitored adequately. \n \nA higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil in \ncombination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor.  A close monitoring of renal \nfunction is required in these patients (see section 4.5).  In patients with renal risk factors, the \nco-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully \nevaluated. \n \nTenofovir disoproxil has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which \nare secreted by the same renal pathway, including the transport proteins human organic anion \ntransporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product).  These \nrenal transport proteins may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of \ntenofovir and cidofovir.  Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products, which are \nsecreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 or MRP 4, might be \nmodified if they are co-administered.  Unless clearly necessary, concomitant use of these medicinal \nproducts which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not recommended, but if such use is \nunavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal safety with tenofovir disoproxil has only been studied to a very limited degree in adult patients \nwith impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 ml/min). \n \nAdult patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, including haemodialysis patients \nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with impaired renal \nfunction.  Therefore, tenofovir disoproxil should only be used if the potential benefits of treatment are \nconsidered to outweigh the potential risks.  In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) the daily dose must be adjusted and renal function should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nBone effects \nIn HIV infected patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil \nwith stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve adult patients, \nsmall decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment \ngroups.  Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly \ngreater in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks.  Decreases in BMD of hip were \nsignificantly greater in this group until 96 weeks.  However, there was no increased risk of fractures or \nevidence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks. \n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen \nin patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \ninhibitor.  Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are \nat a high risk for fractures. \n \nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \ntubulopathy (see section 4.8). \n \nIf bone abnormalities are suspected or detected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. \n \n\n\n\n169 \n\nRenal and bone effects in paediatric population \nThere are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity.  Moreover, the \nreversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is \nrecommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide \nthe appropriate monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and \nconsider the need for supplementation. \n \nRenal effects \nRenal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in \nHIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-0352 (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nRenal monitoring \nRenal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to treatment, and \nmonitored during treatment as in adults (see above). \n \nRenal management \nIf serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient receiving \ntenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements \nof blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal \ntubulopathy).  If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist \nshould be obtained to consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil treatment.  Interrupting treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function \nwhen no other cause has been identified. \n \nCo-administration and risk of renal toxicity \nThe same recommendations apply as in adults (see above). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe use of tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2).  Tenofovir disoproxil should not be initiated in paediatric patients with renal impairment \nand should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir \ndisoproxil therapy. \n \nBone effects \nViread may cause a reduction in BMD.  The effects of tenofovir disoproxil-associated changes in \nBMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are currently unknown (see section 5.1). \n \nIf bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with an \nendocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. \n \nLiver disease \nSafety and efficacy data are very limited in liver transplant patients. \n \nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil in HBV infected patients with \ndecompensated liver disease and who have a Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score > 9.  These patients \nmay be at higher risk of experiencing serious hepatic or renal adverse reactions.  Therefore, \nhepatobiliary and renal parameters should be closely monitored in this patient population. \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis \nFlares on treatment: Spontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are \ncharacterised by transient increases in serum ALT.  After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may \nincrease in some patients (see section 4.8).  In patients with compensated liver disease, these increases \nin serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or \nhepatic decompensation.  Patients with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation \nfollowing hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. \n \n\n\n\n170 \n\nFlares after treatment discontinuation: Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been reported in \npatients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy.  Post-treatment exacerbations are usually \nassociated with rising HBV DNA, and the majority appears to be self-limited.  However, severe \nexacerbations, including fatalities, have been reported.  Hepatic function should be monitored at \nrepeated intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after \ndiscontinuation of hepatitis B therapy.  If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be \nwarranted.  In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not \nrecommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. \n \nLiver flares are especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated liver disease. \n \nCo-infection with hepatitis C or D: There are no data on the efficacy of tenofovir in patients \nco-infected with hepatitis C or D virus. \n \nCo-infection with HIV-1 and hepatitis B: Due to the risk of development of HIV resistance, tenofovir \ndisoproxil should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in \nHIV/HBV co-infected patients.  Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active \nhepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART) and should be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is \nevidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must \nbe considered.  However, it should be noted that increases of ALT can be part of HBV clearance \nduring therapy with tenofovir, see above Exacerbations of hepatitis. \n \nUse with certain hepatitis C virus antiviral agents \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, \nespecially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).  The safety of tenofovir disoproxil in the setting of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established.  The potential risks and benefits associated with \nco-administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with tenofovir disoproxil given in conjunction with a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, particularly in patients at \nincreased risk of renal dysfunction.  Patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV \nprotease inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n\n\n\n171 \n\n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported, particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nElderly \nTenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more \nlikely to have decreased renal function; therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly \npatients with tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nViread granules contain mannitol which may have a mild laxative effect. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nBased on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the \npotential for CYP450-mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir \ndisoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nViread should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nDidanosine \nCo-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and \nTable 2). \n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products \nSince tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with \nmedicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport \nproteins hOAT 1, hOAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir \nand/or the co-administered medicinal products. \n \nUse of tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic \nmedicinal product.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, \nfoscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). \n \nGiven that tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when it is \nco-administered with tenofovir disoproxil. \n \n\n\n\n172 \n\nOther interactions \nInteractions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below \n(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, and once daily \nas “q.d.”). \n \nTable 2: Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic areas \n\n(dose in mg) \n\nEffects on drug levels \nMean percent change in AUC, \n\nCmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with 245 mg \n\ntenofovir disoproxil  \nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntiretrovirals \nProtease inhibitors \nAtazanavir/Ritonavir \n(300 q.d./100 q.d.) \n\nAtazanavir: \nAUC: ↓ 25% \nCmax: ↓ 28% \nCmin: ↓ 26% \nTenofovir: \nAUC: ↑ 37% \nCmax: ↑ 34% \nCmin: ↑ 29% \n\nNo dose adjustment is \nrecommended.

Animal studies do not \nindicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  The use of tenofovir disoproxil may be considered \nduring pregnancy, if necessary. \n \nIn the literature, exposure to tenofovir disoproxil in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to \nreduce the risk of HBV transmission from mother to infant if tenofovir disoproxil is given to mothers, \nin addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine in infants.  \n\nIn three controlled clinical trials, a total of 327 pregnant women with chronic HBV infection were \nadministered tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg) once daily from 28 to 32 weeks gestation through 1 to 2 \nmonths postpartum; women and their infants were followed for up to 12 months after delivery.  No \nsafety signal has emerged from these data. \n\nBreast-feeding \nTenofovir has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the \neffects of tenofovir in newborns/infants.  Therefore Viread should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \n\n\n\n184 \n\nAs a general rule, it is recommended that HIV and HBV infected women do not breast-feed their \ninfants in order to avoid transmission of HIV and HBV to the infant. \n \nFertility \nThere are limited clinical data with respect to the effect of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility.  Animal \nstudies do not indicate harmful effects of tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, \npatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil, rare events of renal impairment, \nrenal failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \nsometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have been reported.  \nMonitoring of renal function is recommended for patients receiving Viread (see section 4.4). \n \nHIV-1: Approximately one third of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions following \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  These reactions \nare usually mild to moderate gastrointestinal events.  Approximately 1% of tenofovir \ndisoproxil-treated adult patients discontinued treatment due to the gastrointestinal events. \n \nHepatitis B: Approximately one quarter of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions \nfollowing treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, most of which are mild.  In clinical trials of \nHBV infected patients, the most frequently occurring adverse reaction to tenofovir disoproxil was \nnausea (5.4%). \n \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients on treatment as well as in patients who \nhave discontinued hepatitis B therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nAssessment of adverse reactions for tenofovir disoproxil is based on safety data from clinical studies \nand post-marketing experience.  All adverse reactions are presented in Table 3. \n \nHIV-1 clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on \nexperience in two studies in 653 treatment-experienced adult patients receiving treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil (n = 443) or placebo (n = 210) in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts for 24 weeks and also in a double-blind comparative controlled study in which 600 \ntreatment-naïve adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 299) or \nstavudine (n = 301) in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz for 144 weeks. \n \nHepatitis B clinical studies: Assessment of adverse reactions from HBV clinical study data is \nprimarily based on experience in two double-blind comparative controlled studies in which 641 adult \npatients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg daily (n = 426) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily (n = 215) for 48 weeks.  The \nadverse reactions observed with continued treatment for 384 weeks were consistent with the safety \nprofile of tenofovir disoproxil.  After an initial decline of approximately -4.9 ml/min (using Cockcroft-\nGault equation) or -3.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (using modification of diet in renal disease [MDRD] equation) \nafter the first 4 weeks of treatment, the rate of annual decline post baseline of renal function reported \nin tenofovir disoproxil treated patients was -1.41 ml/min per year (using Cockcroft-Gault equation) \nand -0.74 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (using MDRD equation). \n \n\n\n\n185 \n\nPatients with decompensated liver disease: The safety profile of tenofovir disoproxil in patients with \ndecompensated liver disease was assessed in a double-blind active controlled study \n(GS-US-174-0108) in which adult patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or entecavir (n = 22) for 48 weeks. \n \nIn the tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse \nevent; 9% of patients experienced a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl through week 48; there were no statistically significant \ndifferences between the combined tenofovir-containing arms and the entecavir arm.  After 168 weeks, \n16% (7/45) of the tenofovir disoproxil group, 4% (2/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup, and 14% (3/22) of the entecavir group experienced tolerability failure.  Thirteen percent (6/45) \nof the tenofovir disoproxil group, 13% (6/45) of the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group, and \n9% (2/22) of the entecavir group had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or \nconfirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nAt week 168, in this population of patients with decompensated liver disease, the rate of death was of \n13% (6/45) in the tenofovir disoproxil group, 11% (5/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup and 14% (3/22) in the entecavir group.  The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma was 18% (8/45) in \nthe tenofovir disoproxil group, 7% (3/45) in the emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil group and 9% \n(2/22) in the entecavir group. \n \nSubjects with a high baseline CPT score were at higher risk of developing serious adverse events (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPatients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B: No new adverse reactions to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified from a randomised, double-blind study (GS-US-174-0121) in which 280 \nlamivudine-resistant patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 141) or \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (n = 139) for 240 weeks. \n \nThe adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment are listed below by \nbody system organ class and frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nTable 3: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil based on \nclinical study and post-marketing experience \n \nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common: hypophosphataemia1 \nUncommon: hypokalaemia1 \nRare: lactic acidosis \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common: dizziness \nCommon: headache \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \nCommon: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, flatulence \nUncommon: pancreatitis \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nCommon: increased transaminases \nRare: hepatic steatosis, hepatitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common: rash \nRare: angioedema \n\n\n\n186 \n\nFrequency Tenofovir disoproxil  \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nUncommon: rhabdomyolysis1, muscular weakness1 \n\nRare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures)\n1, \n\n2, myopathy1 \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nUncommon: increased creatinine, proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) \n\nRare: acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, nephritis (including acute interstitial nephritis)2, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common: asthenia \nCommon: fatigue \n1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally \nassociated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical \ntrials or the tenofovir disoproxil expanded access program.  The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and \nthe expanded access program (n = 7,319). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHIV-1 and hepatitis B: \nRenal impairment \nAs Viread may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8 Summary of the safety profile).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after \ntenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did \nnot completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of renal \nimpairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients \nreceiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete \nrecovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). \n \nLactic acidosis \nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with \nother antiretrovirals.  Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver \ndisease, or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased \nrisk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal \noutcomes. \n \nHIV-1: \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nHepatitis B: \nExacerbations of hepatitis during treatment \nIn studies with nucleoside-naïve patients, on-treatment ALT elevations > 10 times ULN (upper limit \nof normal) and > 2 times baseline occurred in 2.6% of tenofovir disoproxil-treated patients.  ALT \n\n\n\n187 \n\nelevations had a median time to onset of 8 weeks, resolved with continued treatment, and, in a \nmajority of cases, were associated with a ≥ 2 log10 copies/ml reduction in viral load that preceded or \ncoincided with the ALT elevation.  Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment \nIn HBV infected patients, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred \nafter discontinuation of HBV therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1 \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomised trials (studies GS-US-104-0321 and \nGS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 years) who received \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1).  The adverse reactions observed in paediatric \npatients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those observed in \nclinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary of adverse \nreactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected adolescents, the \nBMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed \nin subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects \nwho switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on \ntheir stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \n(median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks) discontinued study drug due to renal adverse \nevents.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings clinically consistent with proximal renal \ntubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil therapy.  Seven patients had estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Among them, 3 patients \nexperienced a clinically meaningful decline in estimated GFR which improved after discontinuation of \ntenofovir disoproxil. \n \nChronic hepatitis B \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on a randomised study (study GS-US-174-0115) in 106 \nadolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B receiving treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks and on a randomised study \n(study GS-US-174-0144) in 89 patients with chronic hepatitis B (2 to  < 12 years of age) receiving \ntreatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) for 48 weeks.  The adverse reactions \nobserved in paediatric patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with \nthose observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary \nof adverse reactions and 5.1). \n \nReductions in BMD have been observed in HBV infected  paediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age.  \nThe BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those \nobserved in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nOther special population(s) \nElderly \nTenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more \nlikely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly \npatients with tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nSince tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended \nin adult patients with renal impairment treated with Viread (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).  The use of \n\n\n\n188 \n\ntenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see sections 4.8 and 5.3), \nand standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \nManagement \nTenofovir can be removed by haemodialysis; the median haemodialysis clearance of tenofovir is \n134 ml/min.  It is not known whether tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AF07 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate is the fumarate salt of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil.  Tenofovir \ndisoproxil is absorbed and converted to the active substance tenofovir, which is a nucleoside \nmonophosphate (nucleotide) analogue.  Tenofovir is then converted to the active metabolite, tenofovir \ndiphosphate, an obligate chain terminator, by constitutively expressed cellular enzymes.  Tenofovir \ndiphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in activated and 50 hours in resting peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and \nthe HBV polymerase by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate \nand, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination.  Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak \ninhibitor of cellular polymerases α, β, and γ.  At concentrations of up to 300 µmol/l, tenofovir has also \nshown no effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or the production of lactic acid in in vitro \nassays. \n \nData pertaining to HIV \nHIV antiviral activity in vitro: The concentration of tenofovir required for 50% inhibition (EC50) of the \nwild-type laboratory strain HIV-1IIIB is 1-6 µmol/l in lymphoid cell lines and 1.1 µmol/l against \nprimary HIV-1 subtype B isolates in PBMCs.  Tenofovir is also active against HIV-1 subtypes A, C, \nD, E, F, G, and O and against HIVBaL in primary monocyte/macrophage cells.  Tenofovir shows \nactivity in vitro against HIV-2, with an EC50 of 4.9 µmol/l in MT-4 cells. \n \nResistance: Strains of HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir and a K65R mutation in reverse \ntranscriptase have been selected in vitro and in some patients (see Clinical efficacy and safety).  \nTenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with strains harbouring \nthe K65R mutation (see section 4.4).  In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase \nhas been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. \n \nClinical studies in treatment-experienced patients have assessed the anti-HIV activity of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg against strains of HIV-1 with resistance to nucleoside inhibitors.  The results \nindicate that patients whose HIV expressed 3 or more thymidine-analogue associated mutations \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n189 \n\n(TAMs) that included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced \nresponse to tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg therapy. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe effects of tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults \nhave been demonstrated in trials of 48 weeks and 144 weeks duration, respectively. \n \nIn study GS-99-907, 550 treatment-experienced adult patients were treated with placebo or tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg for 24 weeks.  The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 427 cells/mm3, the mean \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 3.4 log10 copies/ml (78% of patients had a viral load of \n< 5,000 copies/ml) and the mean duration of prior HIV treatment was 5.4 years.  Baseline genotypic \nanalysis of HIV isolates from 253 patients revealed that 94% of patients had HIV-1 resistance \nmutations associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 58% had mutations associated \nwith protease inhibitors and 48% had mutations associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors. \n \nAt week 24 the time-weighted average change from baseline in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \n(DAVG24) was -0.03 log10 copies/ml and -0.61 log10 copies/ml for the placebo and tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg recipients (p < 0.0001).  A statistically significant difference in favour of tenofovir disoproxil \n245 mg was seen in the time-weighted average change from baseline at week 24 (DAVG24) for CD4 \ncount (+13 cells/mm3 for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus -11 cells/mm3 for placebo, \np-value = 0.0008).  The antiviral response to tenofovir disoproxil was durable through 48 weeks \n(DAVG48 was -0.57 log10 copies/ml, proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 or \n50 copies/ml was 41% and 18% respectively).  Eight (2%) tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg treated patients \ndeveloped the K65R mutation within the first 48 weeks. \n \nThe 144-week, double-blind, active controlled phase of study GS-99-903 evaluated the efficacy and \nsafety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg versus stavudine when used in combination with lamivudine and \nefavirenz in HIV-1 infected adult patients naïve to antiretroviral therapy.  The mean baseline CD4 cell \ncount was 279 cells/mm3, the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.91 log10 copies/ml, 19% of \npatients had symptomatic HIV-1 infection and 18% had AIDS.  Patients were stratified by baseline \nHIV-1 RNA and CD4 count.  Forty-three percent of patients had baseline viral loads \n> 100,000 copies/ml and 39% had CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/ml. \n \nBy intent to treat analysis (missing data and switch in antiretroviral therapy (ART) considered as \nfailure), the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml at \n48 weeks of treatment was 80% and 76% respectively in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, \ncompared to 84% and 80% in the stavudine arm.  At 144 weeks, the proportion of patients with \nHIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ml and 50 copies/ml was 71% and 68% respectively in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg arm, compared to 64% and 63% in the stavudine arm. \n \nThe average change from baseline for HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count at 48 weeks of treatment was \nsimilar in both treatment groups (-3.09 and -3.09 log10 copies/ml; +169 and 167 cells/mm3 in the \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine groups, respectively).  At 144 weeks of treatment, the \naverage change from baseline remained similar in both treatment groups (-3.07 and \n-3.03 log10 copies/ml; +263 and +283 cells/mm3 in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg and stavudine \ngroups, respectively).  A consistent response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was seen \nregardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count. \n \nThe K65R mutation occurred in a slightly higher percentage of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than the active control group (2.7% versus 0.7%).  Efavirenz or lamivudine resistance either \npreceded or was coincident with the development of K65R in all cases.  Eight patients had HIV that \nexpressed K65R in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg arm, 7 of these occurred during the first 48 weeks \nof treatment and the last one at week 96.  No further K65R development was observed up to \nweek 144.  One patient in the tenofovir disoproxil arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus.  \nFrom both the genotypic and phenotypic analyses there was no evidence for other pathways of \nresistance to tenofovir. \n\n\n\n190 \n\n \nData pertaining to HBV \nHBV antiviral activity in vitro: The in vitro antiviral activity of tenofovir against HBV was assessed in \nthe HepG2 2.2.15 cell line.  The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.14 to 1.5 µmol/l, with \nCC50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) values > 100 µmol/l. \n \nResistance: No HBV mutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil resistance have been identified \n(see Clinical efficacy and safety).  In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, \nrtL180M, and rtM204I/V mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine showed a \nsusceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild-type virus.  HBV strains \nexpressing the rtL180M, rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V and rtM250V mutations associated with \nresistance to entecavir showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of wild-\ntype virus.  HBV strains expressing the adefovir-associated resistance mutations rtA181V and \nrtN236T showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild-type virus.  \nViruses containing the rtA181T mutation remained susceptible to tenofovir with EC50 values 1.5-fold \nthat of wild-type virus. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe demonstration of benefit of tenofovir disoproxil in compensated and decompensated disease is \nbased on virological, biochemical and serological responses in adults with HBeAg positive and \nHBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B.  Treated patients included those who were treatment-naïve, \nlamivudine-experienced, adefovir dipivoxil-experienced and patients with lamivudine and/or adefovir \ndipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  Benefit has also been demonstrated based on histological \nresponses in compensated patients. \n \nExperience in patients with compensated liver disease at 48 weeks (studies GS-US-174-0102 and \nGS-US-174-0103) \nResults through 48 weeks from two randomised, phase 3 double-blind studies comparing tenofovir \ndisoproxil to adefovir dipivoxil in adult patients with compensated liver disease are presented in \nTable 4 below.  Study GS-US-174-0103 was conducted in 266 (randomised and treated) \nHBeAg positive patients while study GS-US-174-0102 was conducted in 375 (randomised and treated) \npatients negative for HBeAg and positive for HBeAb. \n \nIn both of these studies tenofovir disoproxil was significantly superior to adefovir dipivoxil for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint of complete response (defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis).  Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was also associated with significantly greater \nproportions of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, when compared to adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg \ntreatment.  Both treatments produced similar results with regard to histological response (defined as \nKnodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell \nfibrosis) at week 48 (see Table 4 below). \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0103 a significantly greater proportion of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup than in the adefovir dipivoxil group had normalised ALT and achieved HBsAg loss at week 48 \n(see Table 4 below). \n \nTable 4: Efficacy parameters in compensated HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients at \nweek 48 \n \n Study 174-0102 (HBeAg negative) Study 174-0103 (HBeAg positive) \nParameter Tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg  \nn = 250 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \n\nn = 125 \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg  \n\nn = 176 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \nn = 90 \n\nComplete \nresponse (%)a \n\n71* 49 67* 12 \n\nHistology     \nHistological response \n(%)b \n\n72 \n \n\n69 74 68 \n\n\n\n191 \n\n Study 174-0102 (HBeAg negative) Study 174-0103 (HBeAg positive) \nParameter Tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil 245 mg  \nn = 250 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \n\nn = 125 \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg  \n\nn = 176 \n\nAdefovir dipivoxil \n10 mg \nn = 90 \n\nMedian HBV DNA \nreduction from \nbaselinec \n(log10 copies/ml) \n\n-4.7* -4.0 -6.4* -3.7 \n\nHBV DNA (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \n(< 69 IU/ml) \n\n \n93* \n\n \n63 \n\n \n76* \n\n \n13 \n\nALT (%) \nNormalised ALTd \n\n \n76 \n\n \n77 \n\n \n68* \n\n \n54 \n\nSerology (%) \nHBeAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n \nn/a \n\n \nn/a \n\n \n22/21 \n\n \n18/18 \n\nHBsAg \nloss/seroconversion \n\n0/0 0/0 3*/1 0/0 \n\n* p-value versus adefovir dipivoxil < 0.05. \na Complete response defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ml and Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at \nleast 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nb Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis. \nc Median change from baseline HBV DNA merely reflects the difference between baseline HBV DNA and the limit of \ndetection (LOD) of the assay. \nd The population used for analysis of ALT normalisation included only patients with ALT above ULN at baseline. \nn/a = not applicable. \n \nTenofovir disoproxil was associated with significantly greater proportions of patients with \nundetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche Cobas \nTaqman HBV assay), when compared to adefovir dipivoxil (study GS-US-174-0102; 91%, 56% and \nstudy GS-US-174-0103; 69%, 9%), respectively. \n \nResponse to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleoside-experienced (n = 51) \nand nucleoside-naïve (n = 375) patients and in patients with normal ALT (n = 21) and abnormal ALT \n(n = 405) at baseline when studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were combined.  \nForty-nine of the 51 nucleoside-experienced patients were previously treated with lamivudine.  \nSeventy-three percent of nucleoside-experienced and 69% of nucleoside-naïve patients achieved \ncomplete response to treatment; 90% of nucleoside-experienced and 88% of nucleoside-naïve patients \nachieved HBV DNA suppression < 400 copies/ml.

Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was associated \nwith a mean change in serum HBV DNA from baseline, in the patients for whom there was 48-week \ndata, of -5.74 log10 copies/ml (n = 18).  In addition, 61% of patients had normal ALT at week 48. \n \nExperience in patients with persistent viral replication (study GS-US-174-0106) \nThe efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg plus 200 mg \nemtricitabine has been evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study (study GS-US-174-0106), in \nHBeAg positive and HBeAg negative adult patients who had persistent viraemia \n(HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 copies/ml) while receiving adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg for more than 24 weeks.  At \nbaseline, 57% of patients randomised to tenofovir disoproxil versus 60% of patients randomised to \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment group had previously been treated with lamivudine.  \nOverall at week 24, treatment with tenofovir disoproxil resulted in 66% (35/53) of patients with \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml (< 69 IU/ml) versus 69% (36/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.672).  In addition 55% (29/53) of patients treated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil had undetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ml [< 29 IU/ml]; the limit of quantification of \nthe Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV assay) versus 60% (31/52) of patients treated with emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil (p = 0.504).  Comparisons between treatment groups beyond week 24 are difficult \nto interpret since investigators had the option to intensify treatment to open-label emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil.  Long-term studies to evaluate the benefit/risk of bitherapy with emtricitabine \nplus tenofovir disoproxil in HBV monoinfected patients are ongoing. \n \nExperience in patients with decompensated liver disease at 48 weeks (study GS-US-174-0108) \nStudy GS-US-174-0108 is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled study evaluating the safety \nand efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45), and \n\n\n\n194 \n\nentecavir (n = 22), in patients with decompensated liver disease.  In the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \narm, patients had a mean CPT score of 7.2, mean HBV DNA of 5.8 log10 copies/ml and mean serum \nALT of 61 U/l at baseline.  Forty-two percent (19/45) of patients had at least 6 months of prior \nlamivudine experience, 20% (9/45) of patients had prior adefovir dipivoxil experience and 9 of \n45 patients (20%) had lamivudine and/or adefovir dipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline.  The \nco-primary safety endpoints were discontinuation due to an adverse event and confirmed increase in \nserum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or confirmed serum phosphate of < 2 mg/dl. \n \nIn patients with CPT scores ≤ 9, 74% (29/39) of tenofovir disoproxil, and 94% (33/35) of \nemtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment groups achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml after \n48 weeks of treatment. \n \nOverall, the data derived from this study are too limited to draw any definitive conclusions on the \ncomparison of emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil versus tenofovir disoproxil, (see Table 8 below). \n \nTable 8: Safety and efficacy parameters in decompensated patients at week 48 \n \n Study 174-0108 \nParameter Tenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEmtricitabine 200 mg/ \ntenofovir disoproxil \n\n245 mg  \n(n = 45) \n\nEntecavir \n(0.5 mg or 1 mg) \n\nn = 22 \n\nTolerability failure \n(permanent \ndiscontinuation of study \ndrug due to a treatment \nemergent AE) \nn (%)a \n\n3 (7%) 2 (4%) 2 (9%) \n\nConfirmed increase in \nserum creatinine \n≥ 0.5 mg/dl from \nbaseline or confirmed \nserum phosphate of \n< 2 mg/dl \nn (%)b \n\n4 (9%) 3 (7%) 1 (5%) \n\nHBV DNA n (%) \n< 400 copies/ml \nn (%) \n\n31/44 (70%) 36/41 (88%) 16/22 (73%) \n\nALT n (%) \nNormal ALT \n\n25/44 (57%) 31/41 (76%) 12/22 (55%) \n\n≥ 2 point decrease in \nCPT from baseline \nn (%) \n\n7/27 (26%) 12/25 (48%) 5/12 (42%) \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in CPT score \n\n-0.8 -0.9 -1.3 \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in MELD score \n\n-1.8 -2.3 -2.6 \n\na p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 0.622, \nb p-value comparing the combined tenofovir-containing arms versus the entecavir arm = 1.000. \n \nExperience beyond 48 weeks in study GS-US-174-0108 \nUsing a noncompleter/switch = failure analysis, 50% (21/42) of subjects receiving tenofovir \ndisoproxil, 76% (28/37) of subjects receiving emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil and 52% (11/21) \nof subjects receiving entecavir achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 168. \n \nExperience in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV at 240 weeks (study GS-US-174-0121) \nThe efficacy and safety of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind \nstudy (GS-US-174-0121) in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n = 280) with \ncompensated liver disease, viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 IU/ml), and genotypic evidence of \nlamivudine resistance (rtM204I/V +/- rtL180M).  Only five had adefovir-associated resistance \n\n\n\n195 \n\nmutations at baseline.  One hundred forty-one and 139 adult subjects were randomised to a tenofovir \ndisoproxil and emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil treatment arm, respectively.  Baseline \ndemographics were similar between the two treatment arms: At baseline, 52.5% of subjects were \nHBeAg negative, 47.5% were HBeAg positive, mean HBV DNA level was 6.5 log10 copies/ml, and \nmean ALT was 79 U/l, respectively. \n \nAfter 240 weeks of treatment, 117 of 141 subjects (83%) randomised to tenofovir disoproxil had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 51 of 79 subjects (65%) had ALT normalisation.  After 240 weeks of \ntreatment with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 115 of 139 subjects (83%) had \nHBV DNA < 400 copies/ml, and 59 of 83 subjects (71%) had ALT normalisation.  Among the \nHBeAg positive subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil, 16 of 65 subjects (25%) experienced \nHBeAg loss, and 8 of 65 subjects (12%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion through week 240.  In \nthe HBeAg positive subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil, 13 of 68 subjects \n(19%) experienced HBeAg loss, and 7 of 68 subjects (10%) experienced anti-HBe seroconversion \nthrough week 240.  Two subjects randomised to tenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss by \nWeek 240, but not seroconversion to anti-HBs.  Five subjects randomised to emtricitabine plus \ntenofovir disoproxil experienced HBsAg loss, with 2 of these 5 subjects experiencing seroconversion \nto anti-HBs. \n \nClinical resistance \nFour hundred and twenty-six HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n = 250) and HBeAg positive \n(GS-US-174-0103, n = 176) patients initially randomised to double-blind tenofovir disoproxil \ntreatment and then switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil treatment were evaluated for genotypic \nchanges in HBV polymerase from baseline.

Genotypic data \nfrom paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 6/8 patients with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir \ndisoproxil were identified in these isolates.  Genotypic analysis was conducted for 5 subjects in the \ntenofovir disoproxil arm post week 48.  No amino acid substitutions associated with tenofovir \ndisoproxil resistance were detected in any subject. \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0121, 141 patients with lamivudine resistance substitutions at baseline received \ntenofovir disoproxil for up to 240 weeks.  Cumulatively, there were 4 patients who experienced a \nviremic episode (HBV DNA>400 copies/ml) at their last timepoint on tenofovir disoproxil.  Among \nthem, sequence data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV isolates were available for 2 of 4 \npatients.  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were identified \nin these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0115), 52 patients (including 6 patients with lamivudine resistance \nmutations at baseline) initially received blinded tenofovir disoproxil for up to 72 weeks and then \n51/52 patients switched to open-label tenofovir disoproxil (tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup).  Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients within this group with HBV DNA \n> 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n = 6), week 72 (n = 5), week 96 (n = 4), week 144 (n = 2), and week \n192 (n = 3).  Fifty-four patients (including 2 patients with lamivudine resistance mutations at baseline) \n\n\n\n196 \n\ninitially received blinded placebo treatment for 72 weeks, and 52/54 patients followed with tenofovir \ndisoproxil (PLB-tenofovir disoproxil group).  Genotypic evaluations were performed on all patients \nwithin this group with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 96 (n = 17), week 144 (n = 7), and \nweek 192 (n = 8).  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil were \nidentified in these isolates. \n \nIn a paediatric study (GS-US-174-0144), genotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV \nisolates from patients who received tenofovir disoproxil were available for 9 of 10 patients who had \nplasma HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml.  No amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to \ntenofovir disoproxil were identified in these isolates by Week 48. \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years \nof age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an \noptimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of \ntenofovir disoproxil over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at \nweek 24.  However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult \ndata and comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2). \n \nIn patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine \nBMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, \nrespectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and \n-0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the \ntenofovir disoproxil and placebo groups, respectively.  The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group compared to the placebo group.  At week 48, six adolescents in the \ntenofovir disoproxil group and one adolescent in the placebo group had significant lumbar spine BMD \nloss (defined as > 4% loss).  Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir \ndisoproxil, BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment-experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with stable, \nvirologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either \nreplace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original \nregimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.  At week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 92% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA \nconcentrations < 400 copies/ml.  The difference in the proportion of patients who maintained \n< 400 copies/ml at week 48 was mainly influenced by the higher number of discontinuations in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group.  When missing data were excluded, 91% of patients in the \ntenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 94% of patients in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment \ngroup had HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/ml at week 48. \n \nReductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In patients who received treatment with \ntenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and \n-0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean \nchanges at week 48 (end of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, \nand -0.184 and -0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or \nzidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 was similar \nbetween the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  \nTotal body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group compared to the stavudine \nor zidovudine treatment group.  One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and no stavudine or \nzidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  \nBMD Z-scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who \nwere treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks.  BMD Z-scores were not adjusted for height and \nweight. \n \nIn study GS-US-104-0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil \ndiscontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings \n\n\n\n197 \n\nclinically consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil \ntherapy (median tenofovir disoproxil exposure 331 weeks). \n \nChronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive patients \naged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, elevated serum ALT \n(≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 months] were treated with \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (n = 52) or placebo (n = 54) for 72 weeks.  Subjects must have been naïve \nto tenofovir disoproxil, but could have received interferon based regimens (> 6 months prior to \nscreening) or any other non-tenofovir disoproxil containing oral anti-HBV nucleoside/nucleotide \ntherapy (> 16 weeks prior to screening).  At week 72, overall 88% (46/52) of patients in the tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment group and 0% (0/54) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-four percent (26/35) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had \nnormalised ALT at week 72 compared to 31% (13/42) in the placebo group.  Response to treatment \nwith tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in nucleos(t)ide-naïve (n = 20) and nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced (n = 32) patients, including lamivudine-resistant patients (n = 6).  Ninety-five percent of \nnucleos(t)ide-naïve patients, 84% of nucleos(t)ide-experienced patients, and 83% of lamivudine-\nresistant patients achieved HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 72.  Thirty-one of the 32 nucleos(t)ide-\nexperienced patients had prior lamivudine experience.  At week 72, 96% (27/28) of immune-active \npatients (HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, serum ALT > 1.5 x ULN) in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment \ngroup and 0% (0/32) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml.  Seventy-five \npercent (21/28) of immune-active patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normal ALT at \nweek 72 compared to 34% (11/32) in the placebo group. \n \nAfter 72 weeks of blinded randomized treatment, each subject could switch to open-label tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment up to week 192.  After week 72, virologic suppression was maintained for those \nreceiving double-blind tenofovir disoproxil followed by open-label tenofovir disoproxil (tenofovir \ndisoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil group): 86.5% (45/52) of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir \ndisoproxil group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/ml at week 192.  Among the subjects who received \nplacebo during the double-blind period, the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL \nrose sharply after they began treatment with open-label tenofovir disoproxil (PLB-tenofovir disoproxil \ngroup): 74.1% (40/54) of subjects in the PLB-tenofovir disoproxil group had HBV DNA \n< 400 copies/ml at week 192.  The proportion of subjects with ALT normalization at week 192 in the \ntenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil group was 75.8% (25/33) among those who were HBeAg \npositive at baseline and 100.0% (2 of 2 subjects) among those who were HBeAg negative at baseline.  \nSimilar percentages of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir disoproxil and PLB-tenofovir \ndisoproxil groups (37.5% and 41.7%, respectively) experienced seroconversion to anti-HBe through \nweek 192. \n \nBone Mineral Density (BMD) data from Study GS-US-174-0115 are summarized in Table 9: \n \nTable 9: Bone Mineral Density Evaluation at Baseline, Week 72 and 192 \n \n\n \n\nBaseline Week 72 Week 192 \nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nLumbar spine \nmean (SD) \nBMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.42  \n(0.762) \n\n-0.26  \n(0.806) \n\n-0.49  \n(0.852)  -0.23 (0.893)  -0.37 (0.946)  \n\n-0.44 \n(0.920)  \n\nLumbar spine \nmean (SD) \nchange from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA -0.06  (0.320) \n0.10  \n\n(0.378) \n0.02  \n\n(0.548) \n-0.10 \n\n(0.543) \n\nWhole body \nmean (SD) \nBMD Z-scorea \n\n−0.19  \n(1.110) \n\n−0.23 \n(0.859) \n\n−0.36 \n (1.077) −0.12 (0.916) −0.38 (0.934) \n\n−0.42 \n (0.942) \n\n\n\n198 \n\n \n\nBaseline Week 72 Week 192 \nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nTenofovir \ndisoproxil-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nPLB-\ntenofovir \ndisoproxil \n\nWhole body \nmean (SD) \nchange from \nbaseline \nBMD Z-scorea \n\nNA NA −0.16 (0.355) 0.09 (0.349) \n-0.16 \n\n(0.521) \n-0.19  \n\n(0.504) \n\nLumbar spine \nBMD at least \n6% decreaseb \n\nNA NA 1.9% (1 subject) 0% \n3.8% \n\n(2 subjects) \n3.7% \n\n(2 subjects) \n\nWhole body \nBMD at least \n6% decreaseb \n\nNA NA 0% 0% 0% 1.9% (1 subject) \n\nLumbar spine \nBMD mean % \nincrease \n\nNA NA 5.14% 8.08% 10.05% 11.21% \n\nWhole body \nBMD mean % \nincrease \n\nNA NA 3.07% 5.39% 6.09% 7.22% \n\nNA = Not Applicable \na BMD Z-scores not adjusted for height and weight \nb Primary safety endpoint through week 72 \n \nIn study GS-US-174-0144, 89 HBeAg-negative and -positive patients aged 2 to < 12 years with \nchronic hepatitis B were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 245 mg \n(n = 60) or placebo (n = 29) once daily for 48 weeks.  Subjects must have been naïve to tenofovir \ndisoproxil, with HBV DNA > 105 copies/mL (~ 4.2 log10 IU/mL) and ALT >1.5 × the upper limit of \nnormal (ULN) at screening.  At week 48, 77% (46 of 60) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil \ntreatment group and 7% (2 of 29) of patients in the placebo group had HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL \n(69 IU/mL). Sixty-six percent (38 of 58) of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil group had normalized \nALT at week 48 compared with 15% (4 of 27) in the placebo group. .Twenty-five percent(14 of 56) of \npatients in the tenofovir disoproxil group and 24% (7 of 29) of patients in the placebo group achieved \nHBeAg seroconversion at Week 48. \n\nResponse to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil was comparable in treatment-naïve and treatment-\nexperienced subjects with 76% (38/50) of treatment-naïve and 80% (8/10) of treatment-experienced \nsubjects achieving HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL (69 IU/ml) at Week 48.

Administration of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil \nwith a meal to HIV infected patients resulted in mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values of \n326 (36.6%) ng/ml, 3,324 (41.2%) ng·h/ml and 64.4 (39.4%) ng/ml, respectively.  Maximum tenofovir \nconcentrations are observed in serum within one hour of dosing in the fasted state and within two \nhours when taken with food.  The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted \npatients was approximately 25%.  Administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a high fat meal \nenhanced the oral bioavailability, with an increase in tenofovir AUC by approximately 40% and Cmax \nby approximately 14%.  Following the first dose of tenofovir disoproxil in fed patients, the median \nCmax in serum ranged from 213 to 375 ng/ml.  However, administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a \nlight meal did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration the steady-state volume of distribution of tenofovir was \nestimated to be approximately 800 ml/kg.  After oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir \nis distributed to most tissues with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidney, liver and the \nintestinal contents (preclinical studies).  In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum \nprotein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to \n25 µg/ml. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the \nCYP450 enzymes.  Moreover, at concentrations substantially higher (approximately 300-fold) than \nthose observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major \nhuman CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, \n\n\n\n200 \n\nCYP2E1, or CYP1A1/2).  Tenofovir disoproxil at a concentration of 100 µmol/l had no effect on any \nof the CYP450 isoforms, except CYP1A1/2, where a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction \nin metabolism of CYP1A1/2 substrate was observed.  Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically \nsignificant interactions involving tenofovir disoproxil and medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 \nwould occur. \n \nElimination \nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system \nwith approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous \nadministration.  Total clearance has been estimated to be approximately 230 ml/h/kg (approximately \n300 ml/min).  Renal clearance has been estimated to be approximately 160 ml/h/kg (approximately \n210 ml/min), which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate.  This indicates that active tubular \nsecretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir.  Following oral administration the \nterminal half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. \n \nStudies have established the pathway of active tubular secretion of tenofovir to be influx into proximal \ntubule cell by the human organic anion transporters (hOAT) 1 and 3 and efflux into the urine by the \nmultidrug resistant protein 4 (MRP 4). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were independent of tenofovir disoproxil dose over the dose range \n75 to 600 mg and were not affected by repeated dosing at any dose level. \n \nAge \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in the elderly (over 65 years of age). \n \nGender \nLimited data on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in women indicate no major gender effect. \n \nEthnicity \nPharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in different ethnic groups. \n \nPaediatric population \nHIV-1: Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 8 HIV-1 infected adolescent \npatients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg and in 23 HIV-1 infected children aged \n2 to < 12 years (see Table 11 below).  Tenofovir exposure achieved in these paediatric patients \nreceiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or 6.5 mg/kg body weight tenofovir \ndisoproxil up to a maximum dose of 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving \nonce-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n \nTable 11: Mean (± SD) tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters by age groups for paediatric \npatients \n \n\nDose and formulation 245 mg film-coated tablet \n12 to < 18 years (n = 8) \n\n6.5 mg/kg granules \n2 to < 12 years (n = 23) \n\nCmax (μg/ml) 0.38 ± 0.13 0.24 ± 0.13 \nAUCtau (μg·h/ml) 3.39 ± 1.22 2.59 ± 1.06 \n\n \nChronic hepatitis B: Steady-state tenofovir exposure in HBV infected adolescent patients \n(12 to < 18 years of age) receiving an oral daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg was similar to \nexposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. \n \nTenofovir exposure in HBV infected paediatric patients 2 to < 12 years of age receiving an oral daily \ndose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg of body weight (tablet or granules) up to a maximum dose of \n245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 2 to <12 years of age \nreceiving a once daily dose of tenofovir disoproxil 6.5 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg. \n\n\n\n201 \n\n \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in children under 2 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose of \ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult patients with varying degrees of \nrenal impairment defined according to baseline adult creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal \nfunction when CrCl > 80 ml/min; mild with CrCl = 50-79 ml/min; moderate with \nCrCl = 30-49 ml/min and severe with CrCl = 10-29 ml/min).  Compared with patients with normal \nrenal function, the mean (%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng·h/ml in subjects \nwith CrCl > 80 ml/min to respectively 3,064 (30%) ng·h/ml, 6,009 (42%) ng·h/ml and 15,985 \n(45%) ng·h/ml in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment. \n \nPharmacokinetic modelling of single-dose pharmacokinetic data in non-HIV and non-HBV infected \nadult subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment was used to determine dose and dosing \ninterval recommendations for adult subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nDoses of 132 mg, 65 mg and 33 mg tenofovir disoproxil granules once daily are recommended in adult \npatients with calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to 49 ml/min, 20 to 29 ml/min or 10 to \n19 ml/min, respectively.  Although these doses are not expected to exactly reproduce the \npharmacokinetic profile of tenofovir in patients with normal renal function receiving tenofovir \ndisoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets, they are considered to represent the best balance of benefit and \nrisk for patients with renal impairment. \n \nIn subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl < 10 ml/min) requiring haemodialysis, a dose \nof 16.5 mg tenofovir disoproxil following completion of haemodialysis is predicted to limit tenofovir \nsystemic accumulation to exposures approximately 2-fold compared to those observed in patients with \nnormal renal function receiving tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets.  This dosing \nrecommendation balances the need to limit drug accumulation while attempting to maintain sufficient \ntenofovir concentrations over the dosing interval similar to trough concentrations observed in patients \nwith normal renal function receiving tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablets. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine clearance \n< 10 ml/min and in patients with ESRD managed by peritoneal or other forms of dialysis have not \nbeen studied. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in paediatric patients with renal impairment have not been studied.  \nNo data are available to make dose recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV, non-HBV infected adult \npatients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) \nclassification.  Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic \nimpairment suggesting that no dose adjustment is required in these subjects.  The mean (%CV) \ntenofovir Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/ml and 2,050 (50.8%) ng·h/ml, respectively, \nin normal subjects compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/ml and 2,310 (43.5%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/ml and 2,740 (44.0%) ng·h/ml in subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment. \n \nIntracellular pharmacokinetics \nIn non-proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the half-life of tenofovir \ndiphosphate was found to be approximately 50 hours, whereas the half-life in phytohaemagglutinin-\nstimulated PBMCs was found to be approximately 10 hours. \n \n\n\n\n202 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety pharmacology studies reveal no special hazard for humans.  Findings in repeated \ndose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical \nexposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a \ndecrease in serum phosphate concentration.  Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) \nand reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs).  The bone toxicity in young adult rats and \ndogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred \nin juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the \nexposure in patients).  Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-\nrelated decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in BMD. \n \nGenotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results \nin one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat \nhepatocytes.  However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n \nOral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an \nextremely high dose in mice.  These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. \n \nReproductive studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal \nparameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in peri-\npostnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \nThe active substance tenofovir disoproxil and its main transformation products are persistent in the \nenvironment. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n220 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nViread 123 mg film-coated tablets \ntenofovir disoproxil \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child starts taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for your child only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child’s. \n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Viread is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before your child takes Viread \n3. How to take Viread \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Viread \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Viread is and what it is used for \n \nViread contains the active substance tenofovir disoproxil.  This active substance is an antiretroviral or \nantiviral medicine which is used to treat HIV or HBV infection or both.  Tenofovir is a nucleotide \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor, generally known as an NRTI and works by interfering with the normal \nworking of an enzyme (in HIV reverse transcriptase, in hepatitis B DNA polymerase) that are \nessential for the viruses to reproduce themselves.  In HIV Viread should always be used combined \nwith other medicines to treat HIV infection. \n \nViread 123 mg tablets are a treatment for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. \n \nViread 123 mg tablets are for use in children.  They are only suitable for: \n• children aged 6 to less than 12 years \n• who weigh from 17 kg to less than 22 kg \n• who have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective \n\ndue to development of resistance, or have caused side effects. \n \nViread 123 mg tablets are also a treatment for chronic hepatitis B, an infection with HBV \n(hepatitis B virus). \n \nViread 123 mg tablets are for use in children.  They are only suitable for: \n• children aged 6 to less than 12 years \n• who weigh from 17 kg to less than 22 kg \n \nYour child does not have to have HIV to be treated with Viread for HBV. \n \nThis medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Viread your child may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection.  Your child can also pass on HIV or HBV \nto others, so it is important to take precautions to avoid infecting other people. \n \n \n\n\n\n221 \n\n2. What you need to know before your child takes Viread \n \nDo not give Viread \n \n• If your child is allergic to tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n \n\n If this applies to your child, tell their doctor immediately and don’t give Viread. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n• For HIV, Viread 123 mg tablets are only suitable for children who have already been treated \n\nwith other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due to development of resistance, \nor have caused side effects. \n\n \n• Check your child’s age and weight to see if Viread 123 mg tablets are suitable, see Children \n\nand adolescents. \n \nTalk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist before giving Viread. \n \n• Take care not to infect other people.  Your child can still pass on HIV when taking this \n\nmedicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy.  Viread does not \nreduce the risk of passing on HBV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. \nDiscuss with your child’s doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. \n\n \n• Talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child has had kidney disease or if tests \n\nhave shown problems with their kidneys.  Viread should not be given to children with \nexisting kidney problems.  Viread may affect your child’s kidneys during treatment.  Before \nstarting treatment, your child’s doctor may order blood tests to assess your child’s kidney \nfunction.  Your child’s doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor how your \nchild’s kidneys work. \n\n \nViread is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your child’s kidneys (see \nOther medicines and Viread).  If this is unavoidable, your child’s doctor will monitor your \nchild’s kidney function once a week. \n \n\n• Bone problems.  Some adult patients with HIV taking combination antiretroviral therapy may \ndevelop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply \nto the bone).  The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some \nof the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, \naches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.  If you \nnotice any of these symptoms tell your child’s doctor. \n\n \nBone problems (sometimes resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney \ntubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n \n• Talk to your child’s doctor if your child has a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  \n\nPatients with liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with \nantiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If your \nchild has hepatitis B infection, your child’s doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for \nthem.  If your child has a history of liver disease or chronic hepatitis B infection your child’s \ndoctor may conduct blood tests to monitor their liver function. \n\n \n• Look out for infections.  If your child has advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and has an \n\ninfection, they may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the \nsymptoms of an existing infection once treatment with Viread is started.  These symptoms may \n\n\n\n222 \n\nindicate that your child’s body’s improved immune system is fighting infection.  Look out for \nsigns of inflammation or infection soon after your child starts taking Viread.  If you notice signs \nof inflammation or infection, tell your child’s doctor at once. \n\n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after your child starts taking \nmedicines for the treatment of their HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many \nmonths after the start of treatment.  If you notice that your child has any symptoms of infection \nor other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and \nmoving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform \nyour child’s doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nViread 123 mg tablets are only suitable for: \n• HIV-1 infected children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 17 kg to less than \n\n22 kg who have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully \neffective due to development of resistance, or have caused side effects. \n \n\n• HBV infected children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 17 kg to less than \n22 kg \n\n \nViread 123 mg tablets are not suitable for the following groups: \n• Not for children who weigh under 17 kg or 22 kg and over.  Contact your child’s doctor if your \n\nchild is outside the permitted weight. \n• Not for children and adolescents under 6 years or 12 years and over. \n\n \nFor dosage see section 3, How to take Viread. \n \nOther medicines and Viread \n \nTell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if they are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \n• Don’t stop any anti-HIV medicines prescribed by your child’s doctor when they start Viread if \n\nthey have both HBV and HIV. \n \n• Do not give Viread if your child is already taking other medicines containing tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide.  Do not give Viread together with medicines containing \nadefovir dipivoxil (a medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis B). \n\n \n• It is very important to tell your child’s doctor if your child is taking other medicines that \n\nmay damage their kidneys. \n \n\nThese include: \n \n\n• aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infection), \n• amphotericin B (for fungal infection), \n• foscarnet, ganciclovir, or cidofovir (for viral infection), \n• interleukin-2 (to treat cancer), \n• adefovir dipivoxil (for HBV), \n• tacrolimus (for suppression of the immune system), \n• non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains). \n\n \n• Other medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Viread with other \n\nantiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in the blood and \n\n\n\n223 \n\nmay reduce CD4 cell counts.  Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess \nlactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported when medicines \ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your child’s doctor will \ncarefully consider whether to treat your child with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. \n \n\n• It is also important to tell your doctor if your child is taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. \n\n \nViread with food and drink \n \nGive Viread with food (for example, a meal or a snack). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, or they think they may be pregnant, ask your child’s doctor \nor pharmacist for advice before they take this medicine. \n \n• If your child has taken Viread during their pregnancy, your child’s doctor may request regular \n\nblood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of the baby.  In children \nwhose mothers took medicines like Viread (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the \nprotection against the virus outweighed the risk of side effects. \n\n \n• Your child must not breast-feed during treatment with Viread.  This is because the active \n\nsubstance in this medicine passes into human breast milk. \n \n• Your child must not breast-feed, to avoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nViread can cause dizziness.  If your child feels dizzy while taking Viread, they must not drive or ride \na bicycle and must not use any tools or machines. \n \nViread contains lactose \n \nTell your child’s doctor before giving Viread.  If you have been told by your child’s doctor that \nyour child has an intolerance to some sugars, contact your child’s doctor before they take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nViread contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n3. How to take Viread \n \nYour child must always take this medicine exactly as their doctor or pharmacist has told you.  \nCheck with your child’s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n• Children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 17 kg to less than 22 kg: \n\n1 tablet each day with food (for example, a meal or a snack). \n \nYour child’s doctor will monitor their weight. \n \nYour child must always take the dose recommended by their doctor.  This is to make sure that \ntheir medicine is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do \nnot change the dose unless your child’s doctor tells you to. \n\n\n\n224 \n\n \nFor HIV, your child’s doctor will prescribe Viread with other antiretroviral medicines. \n \nRefer to the patient information leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those \nmedicines. \n \nIf your child takes more Viread than they should \n \nIf your child accidentally takes too many Viread tablets, they may be at increased risk of experiencing \npossible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).  Contact your child’s \ndoctor or nearest emergency department for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can \neasily describe what your child has taken. \n \nIf your child forgets to take Viread \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Viread.  If your child misses a dose, work out how long since they \nshould have taken it. \n \n• If it is less than 12 hours after it is usually taken, they should take it as soon as they can, and \n\nthen take their next dose at its regular time. \n \n• If it is more than 12 hours since your child should have taken it, forget about the missed dose.  \n\nWait and give the next dose at the regular time.  Do not give a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten tablet. \n\n \nIf your child throws up less than 1 hour after taking Viread, give your child another tablet.  Your \nchild does not need to take another tablet if they were sick more than 1 hour after taking Viread. \n \nIf your child stops taking Viread \n \nYour child must not stop taking Viread without their doctor’s advice.  Stopping treatment with Viread \nmay reduce the effectiveness of the treatment recommended by your child’s doctor. \n \nIf your child has hepatitis B or HIV and hepatitis B together (co-infection), it is very important \nnot to stop their Viread treatment without talking to your child’s doctor first.  Some patients have had \nblood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping Viread.  Your child \nmay require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced \nliver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of \nyour child’s hepatitis. \n \n• Talk to your child’s doctor before your child stops taking Viread for any reason, particularly if \n\nyour child is experiencing any side effects or they have another illness. \n \n• Tell your child’s doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after your child stops \n\ntreatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \n• Contact your child’s doctor before your child restarts taking Viread tablets. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your child’s doctor will test for these changes. \n \n\n\n\n225 \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPossible serious side effects: tell your child’s doctor immediately \n \n• Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare (can affect up to 1 in every \n\n1,000 patients) but serious side effect that can be fatal.  The following side effects may be signs \nof lactic acidosis: \n\n \n• deep, rapid breathing \n• drowsiness \n• feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and stomach pain \n\n \n If you think that your child may have lactic acidosis, contact your child’s doctor immediately. \n \nOther possible serious side effects \n \nThe following side effects are uncommon (this can affect up to 1 in every 100 patients): \n \n• pain in the tummy (abdomen) caused by inflammation of the pancreas \n \n• damage to kidney tubule cells \n \nThe following side effects are rare (these can affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients): \n \n• inflammation of the kidney, passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty \n \n• changes to your child’s urine and back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney \n\nfailure \n \n• softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), which may occur \n\ndue to damage to kidney tubule cells \n \n• fatty liver \n \n If you think that your child may have any of these serious side effects, talk to your child’s \n\ndoctor. \n \nMost frequent side effects \n \nThe following side effects are very common (these can affect at least 10 in every 100 patients): \n \n• diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea), dizziness, rash, feeling weak \n \nTests may also show: \n \n• decreases in phosphate in the blood \n \nOther possible side effects \n \nThe following side effects are common (these can affect up to 10 in every 100 patients): \n \n• flatulence \n \nTests may also show: \n \n• liver problems \n\n\n\n226 \n\n \nThe following side effects are uncommon (these can affect up to 1 in every 100 patients): \n \n• breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness \n \nTests may also show: \n \n• decreases in potassium in the blood \n \n• increased creatinine in your child’s blood \n \n• pancreas problems \n \nThe breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in \nfractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood may \noccur due to damage to kidney tubule cells. \n \nThe following side effects are rare (these can affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients): \n \n• pain in the tummy (abdomen) caused by inflammation of the liver \n \n• swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for your child only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child’s. \n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Viread is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before your child takes Viread \n3. How to take Viread \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Viread \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Viread is and what it is used for \n \nViread contains the active substance tenofovir disoproxil.  This active substance is an antiretroviral or \nantiviral medicine which is used to treat HIV or HBV infection or both.  Tenofovir is a nucleotide \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor, generally known as an NRTI and works by interfering with the normal \nworking of an enzyme (in HIV reverse transcriptase, in hepatitis B DNA polymerase) that are \nessential for the viruses to reproduce themselves.  In HIV Viread should always be used combined \nwith other medicines to treat HIV infection. \n \nViread 163 mg tablets are a treatment for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. \n \nViread 163 mg tablets are for use in children.  They are only suitable for: \n• children aged 6 to less than 12 years \n• who weigh from 22 kg to less than 28 kg \n• who have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective \n\ndue to development of resistance, or have caused side effects. \n \nViread 163 mg tablets are also a treatment for chronic hepatitis B, an infection with HBV \n(hepatitis B virus). \n \nViread 163 mg tablets are for use in children.  They are only suitable for: \n• children aged 6 to less than 12 years \n• who weigh from 22 kg to less than 28 kg \n \nYour child does not have to have HIV to be treated with Viread for HBV. \n \nThis medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Viread your child may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection.  Your child can also pass on HIV or HBV \nto others, so it is important to take precautions to avoid infecting other people. \n \n \n\n\n\n230 \n\n2. What you need to know before your child takes Viread \n \nDo not give Viread \n \n• If your child is allergic to tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n \n\n If this applies to your child, tell their doctor immediately and don’t give Viread. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n• For HIV, Viread 163 mg tablets are only suitable for children who have already been treated \n\nwith other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due to development of resistance, \nor have caused side effects. \n\n \n• Check your child’s age and weight to see if Viread 163 mg tablets are suitable, see Children \n\nand adolescents. \n \nTalk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist before giving Viread. \n \n• Take care not to infect other people.  Your child can still pass on HIV when taking this \n\nmedicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy.  Viread does not \nreduce the risk of passing on HBV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. \nDiscuss with your child’s doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. \n\n \n• Talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child has had kidney disease or if tests \n\nhave shown problems with their kidneys.  Viread should not be given to children with \nexisting kidney problems.  Viread may affect your child’s kidneys during treatment.  Before \nstarting treatment, your child’s doctor may order blood tests to assess your child’s kidney \nfunction.  Your child’s doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor how your \nchild’s kidneys work. \n\n \nViread is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your child’s kidneys (see \nOther medicines and Viread).  If this is unavoidable, your child’s doctor will monitor your \nchild’s kidney function once a week. \n \n\n• Bone problems.  Some adult patients with HIV taking combination antiretroviral therapy may \ndevelop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply \nto the bone).  The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some \nof the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, \naches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.  If you \nnotice any of these symptoms tell your child’s doctor. \n\n \nBone problems (sometimes resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney \ntubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n \n• Talk to your child’s doctor if your child has a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  \n\nPatients with liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with \nantiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If your \nchild has hepatitis B infection, your child’s doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for \nthem.  If your child has a history of liver disease or chronic hepatitis B infection your child’s \ndoctor may conduct blood tests to monitor their liver function. \n\n \n• Look out for infections.  If your child has advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and has an \n\ninfection, they may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the \nsymptoms of an existing infection once treatment with Viread is started.  These symptoms may \n\n\n\n231 \n\nindicate that your child’s body’s improved immune system is fighting infection.  Look out for \nsigns of inflammation or infection soon after your child starts taking Viread.  If you notice signs \nof inflammation or infection, tell your child’s doctor at once. \n\n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after your child starts taking \nmedicines for the treatment of their HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many \nmonths after the start of treatment.  If you notice that your child has any symptoms of infection \nor other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and \nmoving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform \nyour child’s doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nViread 163 mg tablets are only suitable for: \n• HIV-1 infected children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 22 kg to less than \n\n28 kg who have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully \neffective due to development of resistance, or have caused side effects. \n\n• HBV infected children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 22 kg to less than 28 kg \n \nViread 163 mg tablets are not suitable for the following groups: \n• Not for children who weigh under 22 kg or 28 kg and over.  Contact your child’s doctor if your \n\nchild is outside the permitted weight. \n• Not for children and adolescents under 6 years or 12 years and over. \n \nFor dosage see section 3, How to take Viread. \n \nOther medicines and Viread \n \nTell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if they are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \n• Don’t stop any anti-HIV medicines prescribed by your child’s doctor when they start Viread if \n\nthey have both HBV and HIV. \n \n\n• Do not give Viread if your child is already taking other medicines containing tenofovir \ndisoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide.  Do not give Viread together with medicines containing \nadefovir dipivoxil (a medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis B). \n\n \n• It is very important to tell your child’s doctor if your child is taking other medicines that \n\nmay damage their kidneys. \n \n\nThese include: \n \n\n• aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infection), \n• amphotericin B (for fungal infection), \n• foscarnet, ganciclovir, or cidofovir (for viral infection), \n• interleukin-2 (to treat cancer), \n• adefovir dipivoxil (for HBV), \n• tacrolimus (for suppression of the immune system), \n• non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains). \n\n \n• Other medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Viread with other \n\nantiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in the blood and \nmay reduce CD4 cell counts.  Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess \nlactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported when medicines \n\n\n\n232 \n\ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your child’s doctor will \ncarefully consider whether to treat your child with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. \n \n\n• It is also important to tell your doctor if your child is taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. \n\n \nViread with food and drink \n \nGive Viread with food (for example, a meal or a snack). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, or they think they may be pregnant, ask your child’s doctor \nor pharmacist for advice before they take this medicine. \n \n• If your child has taken Viread during their pregnancy, your child’s doctor may request regular \n\nblood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of the baby.  In children \nwhose mothers took medicines like Viread (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the \nprotection against the virus outweighed the risk of side effects. \n\n \n• Your child must not breast-feed during treatment with Viread.  This is because the active \n\nsubstance in this medicine passes into human breast milk. \n \n• Your child must not breast-feed, to avoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nViread can cause dizziness.  If your child feels dizzy while taking Viread, they must not drive or ride \na bicycle and must not use any tools or machines. \n \nViread contains lactose \n \nTell your child’s doctor before giving Viread.  If you have been told by your child’s doctor that \nyour child has an intolerance to some sugars, contact your child’s doctor before they take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nViread contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n3. How to take Viread \n \nYour child must always take this medicine exactly as their doctor or pharmacist has told you.  \nCheck with your child’s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n• Children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 22 kg to less than 28 kg: \n\n1 tablet each day with food (for example, a meal or a snack). \n \nYour child’s doctor will monitor their weight. \n \nYour child must always take the dose recommended by their doctor.  This is to make sure that \ntheir medicine is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do \nnot change the dose unless your child’s doctor tells you to. \n \nFor HIV, your child’s doctor will prescribe Viread with other antiretroviral medicines. \n\n\n\n233 \n\n \nRefer to the patient information leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those \nmedicines. \n \nIf your child takes more Viread than they should \n \nIf your child accidentally takes too many Viread tablets, they may be at increased risk of experiencing \npossible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).  Contact your child’s \ndoctor or nearest emergency department for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can \neasily describe what your child has taken. \n \nIf your child forgets to take Viread \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Viread.  If your child misses a dose, work out how long since they \nshould have taken it. \n \n• If it is less than 12 hours after it is usually taken, they should take it as soon as they can, and \n\nthen take their next dose at its regular time. \n \n• If it is more than 12 hours since your child should have taken it, forget about the missed dose.  \n\nWait and give the next dose at the regular time.  Do not give a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten tablet. \n\n \nIf your child throws up less than 1 hour after taking Viread, give your child another tablet.  Your \nchild does not need to take another tablet if they were sick more than 1 hour after taking Viread. \n \nIf your child stops taking Viread \n \nYour child must not stop taking Viread without their doctor’s advice.  Stopping treatment with Viread \nmay reduce the effectiveness of the treatment recommended by your child’s doctor. \n \nIf your child has hepatitis B or HIV and hepatitis B together (co-infection),it is very important not \nto stop their Viread treatment without talking to your child’s doctor first.  Some patients have had \nblood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping Viread.  Your child \nmay require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced \nliver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of \nyour child’s hepatitis. \n \n• Talk to your child’s doctor before your child stops taking Viread for any reason, particularly if \n\nyour child is experiencing any side effects or they have another illness. \n \n• Tell your child’s doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after your child stops \n\ntreatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \n• Contact your child’s doctor before your child restarts taking Viread tablets. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.

What Viread is and what it is used for \n \nViread contains the active substance tenofovir disoproxil.  This active substance is an antiretroviral or \nantiviral medicine which is used to treat HIV or HBV infection or both.  Tenofovir is a nucleotide \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor, generally known as an NRTI and works by interfering with the normal \nworking of an enzyme (in HIV reverse transcriptase, in hepatitis B DNA polymerase) that are \nessential for the viruses to reproduce themselves.  In HIV Viread should always be used combined \nwith other medicines to treat HIV infection. \n \nViread 204 mg tablets are a treatment for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. \n \nViread 204 mg tablets are for use in children.  They are only suitable for: \n• children aged 6 to less than 12 years  \n• who weigh from 28 kg to less than 35 kg \n• who have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective \n\ndue to development of resistance, or have caused side effects. \n \nViread 204 mg tablets are also a treatment for chronic hepatitis B, an infection with HBV \n(hepatitis B virus). \n \nViread 204 mg tablets are for use in children.  They are only suitable for: \n• children aged 6 to less than 12 years \n• who weigh from 28 kg to less than 35 kg \n \nYour child does not have to have HIV to be treated with Viread for HBV. \n \nThis medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Viread your child may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection.  Your child can also pass on HIV or HBV \nto others, so it is important to take precautions to avoid infecting other people. \n \n \n\n\n\n239 \n\n2. What you need to know before your child takes Viread \n \nDo not give Viread \n \n• If your child is allergic to tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n \n\n If this applies to your child, tell their doctor immediately and don’t give Viread. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n• For HIV, Viread 204 mg tablets are only suitable for children who have already been treated \n\nwith other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due to development of resistance, \nor have caused side effects. \n\n \n• Check your child’s age and weight to see if Viread 204 mg tablets are suitable, see Children \n\nand adolescents. \n \nTalk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist before giving Viread. \n \n• Take care not to infect other people.  Your child can still pass on HIV when taking this \n\nmedicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy.  Viread does not \nreduce the risk of passing on HBV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. \nDiscuss with your child’s doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. \n\n \n• Talk to your child’s doctor or pharmacist if your child has had kidney disease or if tests \n\nhave shown problems with their kidneys.  Viread should not be given to children with \nexisting kidney problems.  Viread may affect your child’s kidneys during treatment.  Before \nstarting treatment, your child’s doctor may order blood tests to assess your child’s kidney \nfunction.  Your child’s doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor how your \nchild’s kidneys work. \n\n \nViread is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your child’s kidneys (see \nOther medicines and Viread).  If this is unavoidable, your child’s doctor will monitor your \nchild’s kidney function once a week. \n \n\n• Bone problems.  Some adult patients with HIV taking combination antiretroviral therapy may \ndevelop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply \nto the bone).  The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some \nof the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, \naches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.  If you \nnotice any of these symptoms tell your child’s doctor. \n\n \nBone problems (sometimes resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney \ntubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n \n• Talk to your child’s doctor if your child has a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  \n\nPatients with liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with \nantiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If your \nchild has hepatitis B infection, your child’s doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for \nthem.  If your child has a history of liver disease or chronic hepatitis B infection your child’s \ndoctor may conduct blood tests to monitor their liver function. \n\n \n• Look out for infections.  If your child has advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and has an \n\ninfection, they may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the \nsymptoms of an existing infection once treatment with Viread is started.  These symptoms may \n\n\n\n240 \n\nindicate that your child’s body’s improved immune system is fighting infection.  Look out for \nsigns of inflammation or infection soon after your child starts taking Viread.  If you notice signs \nof inflammation or infection, tell your child’s doctor at once. \n\n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after your child starts taking \nmedicines for the treatment of their HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many \nmonths after the start of treatment.  If you notice that your child has any symptoms of infection \nor other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and \nmoving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform \nyour child’s doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nViread 204 mg tablets are only suitable for: \n• HIV-1 infected children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 28 kg to less than \n\n35 kg who have already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully \neffective due to development of resistance, or have caused side effects \n\n• HBV infected children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 28 kg to less than 35 kg \n \nViread 204 mg tablets are not suitable for the following groups: \n• Not for children who weigh under 28 kg or 35 kg and over.  Contact your child’s doctor if your \n\nchild is outside the permitted weight. \n• Not for children and adolescents under 6 years or 12 years and over. \n \nFor dosage see section 3, How to take Viread. \n \nOther medicines and Viread \n \nTell your child’s doctor or pharmacist if they are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \n• Don’t stop any anti-HIV medicines prescribed by your child’s doctor when they start Viread if \n\nthey have both HBV and HIV. \n \n• Do not give Viread if your child is already taking other medicines containing tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide.  Do not give Viread together with medicines containing \nadefovir dipivoxil (a medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis B). \n\n \n• It is very important to tell your child’s doctor if your child is taking other medicines that \n\nmay damage their kidneys. \n \n\nThese include: \n \n\n• aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infection), \n• amphotericin B (for fungal infection), \n• foscarnet, ganciclovir, or cidofovir (for viral infection), \n• interleukin-2 (to treat cancer), \n• adefovir dipivoxil (for HBV), \n• tacrolimus (for suppression of the immune system), \n• non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains). \n\n \n• Other medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Viread with other \n\nantiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in the blood and \nmay reduce CD4 cell counts.  Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess \nlactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported when medicines \n\n\n\n241 \n\ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your child’s doctor will \ncarefully consider whether to treat your child with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. \n \n\n• It is also important to tell your doctor if your child is taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. \n\n \nViread with food and drink \n \nGive Viread with food (for example, a meal or a snack). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, or they think they may be pregnant, ask your child’s doctor \nor pharmacist for advice before they take this medicine. \n \n• If your child has taken Viread during their pregnancy, your child’s doctor may request regular \n\nblood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of the baby.  In children \nwhose mothers took medicines like Viread (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the \nprotection against the virus outweighed the risk of side effects. \n\n \n• Your child must not breast-feed during treatment with Viread.  This is because the active \n\nsubstance in this medicine passes into human breast milk. \n \n• Your child must not breast-feed, to avoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nViread can cause dizziness.  If your child feels dizzy while taking Viread, they must not drive or ride \na bicycle and must not use any tools or machines. \n \nViread contains lactose \n \nTell your child’s doctor before giving Viread.  If you have been told by your child’s doctor that \nyour child has an intolerance to some sugars, contact your child’s doctor before they take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nViread contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n3. How to take Viread \n \nYour child must always take this medicine exactly as their doctor or pharmacist has told you.  \nCheck with your child’s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n• Children aged 6 to less than 12 years who weigh from 28 kg to less than 35 kg: \n\n1 tablet each day with food (for example, a meal or a snack). \n \nYour child’s doctor will monitor their weight. \n \nYour child must always take the dose recommended by their doctor.  This is to make sure that \ntheir medicine is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do \nnot change the dose unless your child’s doctor tells you to. \n \nFor HIV, your child’s doctor will prescribe Viread with other antiretroviral medicines. \n\n\n\n242 \n\n \nRefer to the patient information leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those \nmedicines. \n \nIf your child takes more Viread than they should \n \nIf your child accidentally takes too many Viread tablets, they may be at increased risk of experiencing \npossible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).  Contact your child’s \ndoctor or nearest emergency department for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can \neasily describe what your child has taken. \n \nIf your child forgets to take Viread \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Viread.  If your child misses a dose, work out how long since they \nshould have taken it. \n \n• If it is less than 12 hours after it is usually taken, they should take it as soon as they can, and \n\nthen take their next dose at its regular time. \n \n• If it is more than 12 hours since your child should have taken it, forget about the missed dose.  \n\nWait and give the next dose at the regular time.  Do not give a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten tablet. \n\n \nIf your child throws up less than 1 hour after taking Viread, give your child another tablet.  Your \nchild does not need to take another tablet if they were sick more than 1 hour after taking Viread. \n \nIf your child stops taking Viread \n \nYour child must not stop taking Viread without their doctor’s advice.  Stopping treatment with Viread \nmay reduce the effectiveness of the treatment recommended by your child’s doctor. \n \nIf your child has hepatitis B or HIV and hepatitis B together (co-infection),it is very important not \nto stop their Viread treatment without talking to your child’s doctor first.  Some patients have had \nblood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping Viread.  Your child \nmay require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced \nliver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of \nyour child’s hepatitis. \n \n• Talk to your child’s doctor before your child stops taking Viread for any reason, particularly if \n\nyour child is experiencing any side effects or they have another illness. \n \n• Tell your child’s doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after your child stops \n\ntreatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \n• Contact your child’s doctor before your child restarts taking Viread tablets. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child’s doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nIf Viread has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet is \naddressed to your child (in this case please read “your child” instead of “you”). \n \n \n1. What Viread is and what it is used for \n \nViread contains the active substance tenofovir disoproxil.  This active substance is an antiretroviral or \nantiviral medicine which is used to treat HIV or HBV infection or both.  Tenofovir is a nucleotide \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor, generally known as an NRTI and works by interfering with the normal \nworking of enzymes (in HIV reverse transcriptase; in hepatitis B DNA polymerase) that are essential \nfor the viruses to reproduce themselves.  In HIV Viread should always be used combined with other \nmedicines to treat HIV infection. \n \nViread 245 mg tablets are a treatment for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection.  The \ntablets are suitable for: \n• adults \n• adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who have already been treated with other HIV \n\nmedicines which are no longer fully effective due to development of resistance, or have caused \nside effects. \n\n \nViread 245 mg tablets are also a treatment for chronic hepatitis B, an infection with HBV \n(hepatitis B virus).  The tablets are suitable for: \n• adults \n• adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years. \n \nYou do not have to have HIV to be treated with Viread for HBV. \n \nThis medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Viread you may still develop infections or \nother illnesses associated with HIV infection.  You can also pass on HIV or HBV to others, so it is \nimportant to take precautions to avoid infecting other people. \n \n \n\n\n\n248 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Viread \n \nDo not take Viread \n \n• If you are allergic to tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n \n\n If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately and don’t take Viread. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viread. \n \n• Take care not to infect other people.  You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \n\nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.  Viread does not reduce the risk of passing \non HBV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination.  You must continue to take \nprecautions to avoid this. \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown \n\nproblems with your kidneys.  Viread should not be given to adolescents with existing kidney \nproblems.  Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to assess your kidney \nfunction.  Viread may affect your kidneys during treatment.  Your doctor may order blood tests \nduring treatment to monitor how your kidneys work.  If you are an adult, your doctor may \nadvise you to take the tablets less often.  Do not reduce the prescribed dose, unless your doctor \nhas told you to do so. \n\n \nViread is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Other \nmedicines and Viread).  If this is unavoidable, your doctor will monitor your kidney function \nonce a week. \n \n\n• Bone problems.  Some adult patients with HIV taking combination antiretroviral therapy may \ndevelop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply \nto the bone).  The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some \nof the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, \naches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.  If you \nnotice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n\n \nBone problems (sometimes resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney \ntubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, \nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for you.  If you have a history of liver \ndisease or chronic hepatitis B infection your doctor may conduct blood tests to monitor your \nliver function. \n\n \n• Look out for infections.  If you have advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and have an infection, \n\nyou may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the symptoms of an \nexisting infection once treatment with Viread is started.  These symptoms may indicate that \nyour body’s improved immune system is fighting infection.  Look out for signs of inflammation \nor infection soon after you start taking Viread.  If you notice signs of inflammation or infection, \ntell your doctor at once. \n\n \n\n\n\n249 \n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment. \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are over 65.  Viread has not been studied in patients \n\nover 65 years of age.  If you are older than this and are prescribed Viread, your doctor will \nmonitor you carefully. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nViread 245 mg tablets are suitable for: \n• HIV-1 infected adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg and who \n\nhave already been treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due to \ndevelopment of resistance, or have caused side effects \n\n• HBV infected adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg. \n \nViread 245 mg tablets are not suitable for the following groups: \n• Not for HIV-1 infected children under 12 years of age \n• Not for HBV infected children under 12 years of age. \n \nFor dosage see section 3, How to take Viread. \n \nOther medicines and Viread \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \n• Don’t stop any anti-HIV medicines prescribed by your doctor when you start Viread if you \n\nhave both HBV and HIV. \n \n• Do not take Viread if you are already taking other medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil or \n\ntenofovir alafenamide.  Do not take Viread together with medicines containing adefovir \ndipivoxil (a medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis B). \n\n \n• It is very important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines that may damage \n\nyour kidneys. \n \n\nThese include: \n \n\n• aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infection), \n• amphotericin B (for fungal infection), \n• foscarnet, ganciclovir, or cidofovir (for viral infection), \n• interleukin-2 (to treat cancer), \n• adefovir dipivoxil (for HBV), \n• tacrolimus (for suppression of the immune system), \n• non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains). \n\n \n\n\n\n250 \n\n• Other medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Viread with other \nantiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and \nmay reduce CD4 cell counts.  Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess \nlactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported when medicines \ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your doctor will carefully \nconsider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. \n \n\n• It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. \n\n \nViread with food and drink \n \nTake Viread with food (for example, a meal or a snack). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n• If you have taken Viread during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests \n\nand other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers \ntook NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk \nof side effects. \n\n \n• Do not breast-feed during treatment with Viread.  This is because the active substance in \n\nthis medicine passes into human breast milk. \n \n• If you are a woman with HIV or HBV do not breast-feed, to avoid passing the virus to the baby \n\nin breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nViread can cause dizziness.  If you feel dizzy while taking Viread, do not drive or ride a bicycle and \ndo not use any tools or machines. \n \nViread contains lactose \n \nTell your doctor before taking Viread.  If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \nViread contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n3. How to take Viread \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n• Adults: 1 tablet each day with food (for example, a meal or a snack). \n• Adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg: 1 tablet each day with \n\nfood (for example, a meal or a snack). \n \nIf you have particular difficulty swallowing, you can use the tip of a spoon to crush the tablet.  Then \nmix the powder with about 100 ml (half a glass) of water, orange juice or grape juice and drink \nimmediately. \n\n\n\n251 \n\n \n• Always take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine \n\nis fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not \nchange the dose unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n• If you are an adult and have problems with your kidneys, your doctor may advise you to \n\ntake Viread less frequently. \n \n• If you have HBV your doctor may offer you an HIV test to see if you have both HBV and HIV. \n \nRefer to the patient information leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those \nmedicines. \n \nIf you take more Viread than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take too many Viread tablets, you may be at increased risk of experiencing possible \nside effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).  Contact your doctor or nearest \nemergency department for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what \nyou have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Viread \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Viread.  If you miss a dose, work out how long since you should \nhave taken it. \n \n• If it is less than 12 hours after it is usually taken, take it as soon as you can, and then take your \n\nnext dose at its regular time. \n \n• If it is more than 12 hours since you should have taken it, forget about the missed dose.  Wait \n\nand take the next dose at the regular time.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \ntablet. \n\n \nIf you throw up less than 1 hour after taking Viread, take another tablet.  You do not need to take \nanother tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking Viread. \n \nIf you stop taking Viread \n \nDon’t stop taking Viread without your doctor’s advice.  Stopping treatment with Viread may reduce \nthe effectiveness of the treatment recommended by your doctor. \n \nIf you have hepatitis B or HIV and hepatitis B together (co-infection), it is very important not to \nstop your Viread treatment without talking to your doctor first.  Some patients have had blood tests or \nsymptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping Viread.  You may require blood \ntests for several months after stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or \ncirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis. \n \n• Talk to your doctor before you stop taking Viread for any reason, particularly if you are \n\nexperiencing any side effects or you have another illness. \n \n• Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \n• Contact your doctor before you restart taking Viread tablets. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n252 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPossible serious side effects: tell your doctor immediately \n \n• Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare (can affect up to 1 in every \n\n1,000 patients) but serious side effect that can be fatal.  The following side effects may be signs \nof lactic acidosis: \n\n \n• deep, rapid breathing \n• drowsiness \n• feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and stomach pain \n\n \n If you think that you may have lactic acidosis, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nOther possible serious side effects \n \nThe following side effects are uncommon (this can affect up to 1 in every 100 patients): \n \n• pain in the tummy (abdomen) caused by inflammation of the pancreas \n \n• damage to kidney tubule cells \n \nThe following side effects are rare (these can affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients): \n \n• inflammation of the kidney, passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty \n \n• changes to your urine and back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney failure \n \n• softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), which may occur \n\ndue to damage to kidney tubule cells \n \n• fatty liver \n \n If you think that you may have any of these serious side effects, talk to your doctor. \n \nMost frequent side effects \n \nThe following side effects are very common (these can affect at least 10 in every 100 patients): \n \n• diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea), dizziness, rash, feeling weak \n \nTests may also show: \n \n• decreases in phosphate in the blood \n \nOther possible side effects \n \nThe following side effects are common (these can affect up to 10 in every 100 patients): \n \n• headache, stomach pain, feeling tired, feeling bloated, flatulence \n\n\n\n253 \n\n \nTests may also show: \n \n• liver problems \n \nThe following side effects are uncommon (these can affect up to 1 in every 100 patients): \n \n• breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness \n \nTests may also show: \n \n• decreases in potassium in the blood \n \n• increased creatinine in your blood \n \n• pancreas problems \n \nThe breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in \nfractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood may \noccur due to damage to kidney tubule cells. \n \nThe following side effects are rare (these can affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients): \n \n• pain in the tummy (abdomen) caused by inflammation of the liver \n \n• swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Viread is and what it is used for \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nIf Viread has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet is \naddressed to your child (in this case please read “your child” instead of “you”). \n \n \n1. What Viread is and what it is used for \n \nViread contains the active substance tenofovir disoproxil.  This active substance is an antiretroviral or \nantiviral medicine which is used to treat HIV or HBV infection or both.  Tenofovir is a nucleotide \nreverse transcriptase inhibitor, generally known as an NRTI and works by interfering with the normal \nworking of enzymes (in HIV reverse transcriptase; in hepatitis B DNA polymerase) that are essential \nfor the viruses to reproduce themselves.  In HIV Viread should always be used combined with other \nmedicines to treat HIV infection. \n \nViread 33 mg/g granules are a treatment for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection.  \nThey are suitable for: \n• adults \n• children and adolescents aged 2 to less than 18 years who have already been treated with \n\nother HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due to development of resistance, or \nhave caused side effects. \n\n \nViread 33 mg/g granules are also a treatment for chronic hepatitis B, an infection with HBV \n(hepatitis B virus).  They are suitable for: \n• adults \n• children and adolescents aged 2 to less than 18 years. \n \nYou do not have to have HIV to be treated with Viread for HBV. \n \nThis medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Viread you may still develop infections or \nother illnesses associated with HIV infection.  You can also pass on HIV or HBV to others, so it is \nimportant to take precautions to avoid infecting other people. \n \n \n\n\n\n257 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Viread \n \nDo not take Viread \n \n• If you are allergic to tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine listed in section 6. \n \n\n If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately and don’t take Viread. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Viread. \n \n• Take care not to infect other people.  You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \n\nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.  Viread does not reduce the risk of passing \non HBV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination.  You must continue to take \nprecautions to avoid this. \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown \n\nproblems with your kidneys.  Viread should not be given to children with existing kidney \nproblems.  Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to assess your kidney \nfunction.  Viread may affect your kidneys during treatment.  Your doctor may order blood tests \nduring treatment to monitor how your kidneys work.  If you are an adult, your doctor may \nadvise you to reduce your daily dose of the granules.  Do not reduce the prescribed dose, unless \nyour doctor has told you to do so. \n\n \nViread is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Other \nmedicines and Viread).  If this is unavoidable, your doctor will monitor your kidney function \nonce a week. \n\n \n• Bone problems.  Some adult patients with HIV taking combination antiretroviral therapy may \n\ndevelop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply \nto the bone).  The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some \nof the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, \naches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.  If you \nnotice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n\n \nBone problems (sometimes resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney \ntubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, \nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment for you.  If you have a history of liver \ndisease or chronic hepatitis B infection your doctor may conduct blood tests to monitor your \nliver function. \n\n \n• Look out for infections.  If you have advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and have an infection, \n\nyou may develop symptoms of infection and inflammation or worsening of the symptoms of an \nexisting infection once treatment with Viread is started.  These symptoms may indicate that \nyour body’s improved immune system is fighting infection.  Look out for signs of inflammation \nor infection soon after you start taking Viread.  If you notice signs of inflammation or infection, \ntell your doctor at once. \n\n \n\n\n\n258 \n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment. \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are over 65.  Viread has not been studied in patients \n\nover 65 years of age.  If you are older than this and are prescribed Viread, your doctor will \nmonitor you carefully. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nViread 33 mg/g granules are only suitable for: \n• HIV-1 infected children and adolescents aged 2 to less than 18 years who have already \n\nbeen treated with other HIV medicines which are no longer fully effective due to development \nof resistance, or have caused side effects \n\n• HBV infected children and adolescents aged 2 to less than 18 years. \n \nViread 33 mg/g granules are not suitable for the following groups: \n• Not for HIV-1 infected children under 2 years \n• Not for HBV (Hepatitis B virus) infected children under 2 years. \n \nFor dosage see section 3, How to take Viread. \n \nOther medicines and Viread \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \n• Don’t stop any anti-HIV medicines prescribed by your doctor when you start Viread if you \n\nhave both HBV and HIV. \n \n• Do not take Viread if you are already taking other medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil or \n\ntenofovir alafenamide.  Do not take Viread together with medicines containing adefovir \ndipivoxil (a medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis B). \n\n \n• It is very important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines that may damage \n\nyour kidneys. \n \n\nThese include: \n \n\n• aminoglycosides, pentamidine or vancomycin (for bacterial infection), \n• amphotericin B (for fungal infection), \n• foscarnet, ganciclovir, or cidofovir (for viral infection), \n• interleukin-2 (to treat cancer), \n• adefovir dipivoxil (for HBV), \n• tacrolimus (for suppression of the immune system), \n• non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains). \n\n \n\n\n\n259 \n\n• Other medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Viread with other \nantiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and \nmay reduce CD4 cell counts.  Rarely, inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess \nlactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported when medicines \ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your doctor will carefully \nconsider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and didanosine. \n \n\n• It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. \n\n \nViread with food and drink \n \nViread granules should be mixed with soft food which does not require chewing (for example, \nyoghurt, applesauce or baby food).  If the granules mixture is chewed, it will taste very bitter. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n \n• If you have taken Viread during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests \n\nand other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers \ntook NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIVoutweighed the risk \nof side effects. \n\n \n• Do not breast-feed during treatment with Viread.  This is because the active substance in \n\nthis medicine passes into human breast milk. \n \n• If you are a woman with HIV or HBV do not breast-feed, to avoid passing the virus to the baby \n\nin breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nViread can cause dizziness.  If you feel dizzy while taking Viread, do not drive or ride a bicycle and \ndo not use any tools or machines. \n \nViread granules contain mannitol \n \nMannitol may have a mild laxative effect. \n \n \n3. How to take Viread \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n• Adults and adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 35 kg: 245 mg, \n\nequivalent to 7.5 scoops of granules, once a day. \n• Children aged 2 to less than 12 years: The daily dose in children depends on their weight.  \n\nYour child’s doctor will determine the right dose of Viread granules based on your child’s \nweight. \n\n \n\n\n\n260 \n\nViread granules should be measured with the supplied dosing scoop (see Figure A): \n \nEach level dosing scoop provides 1 g of the granules which contains 33 mg tenofovir disoproxil (as \nfumarate). \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n• Measure out the correct number of level scoops of granules into a container. \n• You must mix the granules with soft food which does not require chewing, for example yoghurt, \n\napplesauce or baby food.  One tablespoon (15 ml) of soft food per one level scoop of granules is \nrequired.  Do not mix the granules with liquids. \n\n• You must take the granules mixed with food immediately. \n• Take all of the mixture you make each time. \n \n• Always take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine \n\nis fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not \nchange the dose unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n• If you are an adult and have problems with your kidneys, your doctor may advise you to \n\nreduce your daily dose of the granules. \n \n• If you have HBV your doctor may offer you an HIV test to see if you have both HBV and HIV. \n \nRefer to the patient information leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those \nmedicines. \n \nIf you take more Viread than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take too much Viread, you may be at increased risk of experiencing possible side \neffects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).  Contact your doctor or nearest \nemergency department for advice.  Keep the granules bottle with you so that you can easily describe \nwhat you have taken. \n \n\nFigure A \n\nFigure B \n \n\nFigure C \n \n\n• For ½ scoop: \n• Fill the dosing scoop up to the “½ line” on the side (see Figure C). \n\n• Fill the dosing scoop to the top. \n• Use the flat edge of clean knife to make the granules even with the top of \n\nthe scoop (see Figure B). \n\n½ line \n \n\n\n\n261 \n\nIf you forget to take Viread \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Viread.  If you miss a dose, work out how long since you should \nhave taken it. \n \n• If it is less than 12 hours after it is usually taken, take it as soon as you can, and then take your \n\nnext dose at its regular time. \n \n• If it is more than 12 hours since you should have taken it, forget about the missed dose.  Wait \n\nand take the next dose at the regular time.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \ndose. \n\n \nIf you throw up less than 1 hour after taking Viread, take another dose.  You do not need to take \nanother dose if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking Viread. \n \nIf you stop taking Viread \n \nDon’t stop taking Viread without your doctor’s advice.  Stopping treatment with Viread may reduce \nthe effectiveness of the treatment recommended by your doctor. \n \nIf you have hepatitis B or HIV and hepatitis B together (co-infection), it is very important not to \nstop your Viread treatment without talking to your doctor first.  Some patients have had blood tests or \nsymptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping Viread.  You may require blood \ntests for several months after stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or \ncirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis. \n \n• Talk to your doctor before you stop taking Viread for any reason, particularly if you are \n\nexperiencing any side effects or you have another illness. \n \n• Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \n• Contact your doctor before you restart taking Viread granules. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPossible serious side effects: tell your doctor immediately \n \n• Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare (can affect up to 1 in every \n\n1,000 patients) but serious side effect that can be fatal.  The following side effects may be signs \nof lactic acidosis: \n\n \n• deep, rapid breathing \n• drowsiness \n• feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and stomach pain \n\n \n If you think that you may have lactic acidosis, contact your doctor immediately. \n \n\n\n\n262 \n\nOther possible serious side effects \n \nThe following side effects are uncommon (this can affect up to 1 in every 100 patients): \n \n• pain in the tummy (abdomen) caused by inflammation of the pancreas \n \n• damage to kidney tubule cells \n \nThe following side effects are rare (these can affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients): \n \n• inflammation of the kidney, passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty \n \n• changes to your urine and back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney failure \n \n• softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), which may occur \n\ndue to damage to kidney tubule cells \n \n• fatty liver \n \n If you think that you may have any of these serious side effects, talk to your doctor. \n \nMost frequent side effects \n \nThe following side effects are very common (these can affect at least 10 in every 100 patients): \n \n• diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea), dizziness, rash, feeling weak \n \nTests may also show: \n \n• decreases in phosphate in the blood \n \nOther possible side effects \n \nThe following side effects are common (these can affect up to 10 in every 100 patients): \n \n• headache, stomach pain, feeling tired, feeling bloated, flatulence \n \nTests may also show: \n \n• liver problems \n \nThe following side effects are uncommon (these can affect up to 1 in every 100 patients): \n \n• breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness \n \nTests may also show: \n \n• decreases in potassium in the blood \n \n• increased creatinine in your blood \n \n• pancreas problems \n \nThe breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in \nfractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood may \noccur due to damage to kidney tubule cells. \n\n\n\n263 \n\n \nThe following side effects are rare (these can affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients): \n \n• pain in the tummy (abdomen) caused by inflammation of the liver \n \n• swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
