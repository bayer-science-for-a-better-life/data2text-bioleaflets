This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEndolucinBeta 40 GBq/mL radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 mL of solution contains 40 GBq Lutetium (177Lu) chloride on activity reference time (ART), \ncorresponding to 10 micrograms of Lutetium (177Lu) (as chloride). \nThe ART is 12:00 pm (noon) on the scheduled day of radiolabelling as indicated by the customer and \ncan be within 0 to 7 days starting from the day of manufacture. \n \nEach 2 mL vial contains an activity ranging from 3 \u2013 80 GBq, corresponding to 0.73 \u2013 19 micrograms \nof Lutetium (177Lu), at ART. The volume is 0.075 \u2013 2 mL. \n \nEach 10 mL vial contains an activity ranging from 8 \u2013 150 GBq, corresponding to 1.9 \u2013\n 36 micrograms of Lutetium (177Lu), at ART. The volume is 0.2 \u2013 3.75 mL. \n \nThe theoretical specific activity is 4,110 GBq/mg of Lutetium (177Lu). The specific activity of the \nmedicinal product at ART is indicated on the label and always greater than 3,000 GBq/mg. \n \nNon carrier added (n.c.a.) Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is produced by the irradiation of highly enriched \n(> 99 %) Ytterbium (176Yb) in neutron sources with a thermal neutron flux between 1013 and \n1016 cm\u22122 s\u22121. The following nuclear reaction is ongoing in the irradiation: \n \n176Yb(n, \u03b3) 177Yb \u2192 177Lu \n \nThe produced Ytterbium (177Yb) with a half-life of 1.9 h decays to Lutetium (177Lu). In a \nchromatographic process, the accumulated Lutetium (177Lu) is separated chemically from the original \ntarget material. \nLutetium (177Lu) emits both medium-energy beta particles and imageable gamma photons, and has a \nhalf-life of 6.647 days. The primary radiation emissions of Lutetium (177Lu) are shown in Table 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Lutetium (177Lu) principle radiation emission data \n\nRadiation Energy (keV)* Abundance (%) \n\nBeta (\u03b2\u2212) 47.66 11.61 \n\nBeta (\u03b2\u2212) 111.69 9.0 \n\nBeta (\u03b2\u2212) 149.35 79.4 \n\nGamma 112.9498 6.17 \n\nGamma 208.3662 10.36 \n\n* mean energies are listed for beta particles \n\n \nLutetium (177Lu) decays by emission of beta radiation to stable Hafnium (177Hf). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nRadiopharmaceutical precursor, solution. \nClear colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEndolucinBeta is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, and it is not intended for direct use in patients. It is \nto be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules that have been specifically developed and \nauthorised for radiolabelling with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEndolucinBeta is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling. \n \nPosology \n \nThe quantity of EndolucinBeta required for radiolabelling and the quantity of \nLutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the \nmedicinal product radiolabelled and its intended use. Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nFor more information concerning paediatric use of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products refer \nto the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEndolucinBeta is intended for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal products which are subsequently \nadministered by the approved route. \n \nEndolucinBeta should not be administered directly to the patient. \n \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nEstablished or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6) \n \nFor information on contraindications to particular Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products \nprepared by radiolabelling with EndolucinBeta, refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIndividual benefit/risk justification \n \nFor each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity \nadministered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required \ntherapeutic effect. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nEndolucinBeta is not to be administered directly to the patient, but must be used for the radiolabelling \nof carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins or other substrates. \n \nRenal impairment and haematological disorders \n \nCareful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation \nexposure is possible. It is recommended to perform individual radiation dosimetry assessments of \nspecific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy. \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been observed after \ntreatment with Lutetium (177 Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours \n(see section 4.8). This should be taken into account when considering the benefit/risk, especially in \npatients with possible risk factors like prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (such as alkylating \nagents). \n\n \nMyelosuppression \n \nAnaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, lymphopenia, and less commonly neutropenia may occur \nduring radioligand therapy with Lutetium (177Lu). Most events are mild and transient. In some patients \nmore than one cell line may be affected. A blood count should be taken at baseline and monitored \nregularly during treatment, in accordance with clinical guidance. \n \nRenal irradiation \n \nRadiolabelled somatostatin analogues are excreted by the kidney. Radiation nephropathy has been \nreported following peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours using other \nradioisotopes. Renal function should be assessed at baseline and during treatment and renal protection \nshould be considered, in accordance with clinical guidance. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nCases of hepatotoxicity have been reported in the post-marketing setting and in the literature in \npatients with liver metastases undergoing treatment with Lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor \nradionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours. Liver function should be monitored regularly during \ntreatment. Dose reduction may be necessary in affected patients. \n \nHormone release syndromes \n \nThere have been reports of carcinoid crisis and other syndromes associated with release of hormones \nfrom functional neuroendocrine tumours following Lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide \ntherapy, which may be related to irradiation of tumour cells. Reported symptoms include flushing and \ndiarrhoea associated with hypotension. Observation of patients by overnight hospitalisation should be \nconsidered in some cases (e.g. patients with poor pharmacologic control of symptoms). In case of \nhormonal crises, treatments may include: intravenous high dose somatostatin analogues, intravenous \nfluids, corticosteroids, and correction of electrolyte disturbances in patients with diarrhoea and/or \nvomiting. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \n \nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported following Lutetium (177Lu) radioligand therapy. Patients \nwith a history of renal insufficiency and high tumour burden may be at greater risk and should be \ntreated with increased caution. Renal function as well as electrolyte balance should be assessed at \nbaseline and during treatment. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nExtravasation \n \nThere have been reports of extravasation of Lutetium (177Lu) labelled ligands in the post-marketing \nsetting. In case of extravasation, infusion of the medicinal product should be immediately ceased, and \nthe nuclear medicine physician and the radiopharmacist should be promptly informed. Management \nshould be in accordance with local protocols. \n \nRadiation protection \n \nPoint-source approximation shows that the average dose rate experienced 20 hours after administration \nof a dose of 7.3 GBq EndolucinBeta labelled radiopharmaceutical (residual radioactivity 1.5 GBq) by \na person at 1 meter distance from the patient\u2019s body centre with an abdominal radius of 15 cm \nis 3.5 \u00b5Sv/h. Doubling the distance to the patient to 2 meters reduces the dose rate by a factor of 4, \nto 0.9 \u00b5Sv/h. The same dose in a patient with an abdominal radius of 25 cm yields a dose rate \nat 1 meter of 2.6 \u00b5Sv/h. The generally accepted threshold for discharge of the treated patient from the \nhospital is 20 \u00b5Sv/h. In most countries, the exposure limit for hospital staff is set the same as for the \ngeneral public at 1 mSv/year. When taking the 3.5 \u00b5Sv/h dose rate as an average, this would allow \nhospital staff to work approx. 300 hours/year in close vicinity of patients treated with EndolucinBeta \nlabeled radiopharmaceuticals without wearing radiation protection. Of course, the nuclear medicine \nstaff is expected to wear standard radiation protection. \nAny other person in close vicinity of the treated patient should be informed about possibilities to \nreduce his/her exposure due to radiation emitted from the patient. \n \nSpecific warnings \n \nFor information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of Lutetium (177Lu)-\nlabelled medicinal products refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nFurther precautions with respect to relatives, carers and hospital staff are provided in section 6.6. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride with other medicinal products have been \nperformed. \n \nFor information concerning interactions associated with the use of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal \nproducts refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to \nbe radiolabelled. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWhen an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is \nimportant to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be \nassumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the \nwoman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using \nionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. Before the use of 177Lu-labelled \nmedicinal products, pregnancy should be excluded using an adequate/validated test. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated during established or \nsuspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded due to the risk of ionizing radiation to \nthe foetus (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nBefore administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breastfeeding, consideration should be \ngiven to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased \nbreastfeeding, and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the \nsecretion of activity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breastfeeding should \nbe interrupted and the expressed feeds discarded. \n \nFertility \n \nAccording to literature reports and taking a conservative approach (maximum patient dose of 10 GBq, \naverage labeling yield and no additional measures), it may be considered that 177Lu-labelled medicinal \nproducts do not lead to reproductive toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male testes or \ngenetic damage in male testes or female ovaries. \n \nFurther information concerning the use of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products concerning \nfertility is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEffects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled \nmedicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions following the administration of a Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal product \nprepared by radiolabelling with EndolucinBeta will be dependent on the specific medicinal product \nbeing used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package \nleaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher \nincidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation \nare less than from the disease itself. \n \nAdverse reactions are divided into groups according to the MedDRA convention frequencies: Very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: \n \nvery common: Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and lymphopenia \n \nEndocrine disorders: \n \nnot known: Carcinoid crisis \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \n \nnot known: Tumour lysis syndrome \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \n \nvery common: Nausea, vomiting \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): \n \ncommon: Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (Myelodysplastic syndrome) (see \nsection 4.4) \nuncommon: Acute myeloid leukaemia (see section 4.4) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \n \nvery common: Alopecia \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDry mouth has been reported among patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer \nreceiving PSMA-targeted Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled radioligands and has been transient. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, described as mild and temporary, has been \nobserved among patients receiving Lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for \nneuroendocrine tumours. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe presence of free Lutetium (177Lu) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of \nEndolucinBeta will lead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoietic stem cell damage. \nTherefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of EndolucinBeta, the radiotoxicity for the patient \nmust be reduced by immediate (i. e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators \nlike Ca-DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body. \n \nThe following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use EndolucinBeta for \nlabelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes: \n- Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or \n- Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) \n \nThese chelating agents help with the elimination of Lutetium (177Lu) radiotoxicity by an exchange \nbetween the calcium ion in the complex and the Lutetium (177Lu) ion. Due to the capacity of the \nchelating ligands (DTPA, EDTA) of forming water soluble complexes, the complexes and bound \nLutetium (177Lu) are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. \n \n1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 \u2013 4 minutes or \nby infusion (1 g in 100 \u2013 250 mL of glucose, or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for \ninjection). \n \nThe chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is \ncirculating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does \nnot preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency.Intravenous \nadministration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours. \n \nIn any case, the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions \nimmediately taken if there is evidence of radiotoxicity. \n \nThe toxicity of free Lutetium (177Lu) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nduring therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10X \n \nThe pharmacodynamic properties of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by \nradiolabelling with EndolucinBeta, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package \nleaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nLutetium (177Lu) emits \u03b2-particles of moderate maximum energy (0.498 MeV) with a maximum tissue \npenetration of approximately 2 mm. Lutetium (177Lu) also emits low-energy \u03b3-rays which allow \nscintigraphic, biodistribution and dosimetry studies with the same Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal \nproducts. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nEndolucinBeta in all subsets of the paediatric population on grounds that the specific medicinal \nproduct does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric \npatients. This waiver does however not extend to any therapeutic uses of the product when linked to a \ncarrier molecule (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by \nradiolabelling with EndolucinBeta, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nDistribution after inadvertent intravenous administration of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride \n \nIn the male and female rat, following intravenous administration, Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is rapidly \ncleared from the blood: at 5 min post injection, only 1.52 % of the injected activity (%ID) is found in \nblood (corresponding to 0.08 %ID/g) and no activity above background levels remains 1 hour post \ndose. Lutetium (177Lu) chloride distributes mainly to the liver, spleen and bone. After one hour, the \namount in the liver is 9.56 % of the injected activity per gram (%ID/g) and in the spleen 5.26 %ID/g. \nIn bone, the content increases from 0.01 %ID/g at 5 min to 0.23 %ID/g after 12 hours. For the \nnext 28 days, further uptake of 177Lu can be observed in the bone, which is compensated in part by \nradioactive decay. Taking into account the radioactive half-life of 177Lu of 6.647 days, the \nradioactivity remaining in the bone after 28 days is only about 0.06 %ID/g. \nFaecal and urinary elimination is slow. As a result of both excretion and radioactive decay, the total \nradioactivity remaining in the body after 28 days is about 1.8 % of the injected dose. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe toxicological properties of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by \nradiolabelling with EndolucinBeta prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nThe toxicity of non-radioactive Lutetium chloride has been studied in different mammalian species \nand using different administration routes. The intraperitoneal LD50 in mice was found to be \napproximately 315 mg/kg. In cats, no pharmacological effects on respiration and cardiovascular \nfunction were observed up to a cumulative intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg. A high dose of 10 GBq of \n\n\n\n9 \n\n177Lu-chloride contains 2.4 \u00b5g Lutetium, corresponding to a human dose of 0.034 \u00b5g/kg. This dose is \napproximately 7 orders of magnitude lower than the intraperitoneal LD50 in mice and more than \n5 orders of magnitude lower than the NOEL observed in cats. Therefore, Lutetium metal-ion toxicity \nof EndolucinBeta (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products can be excluded. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nHydrochloric acid solution \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nRadiolabelling of medicinal products, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins or other \nsubstrates, with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities. \n \nIt is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc., used for the preparation of the radiolabelled \nmedicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only \nsyringe needles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to \nminimise trace metal impurity levels. \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with medicinal \nproducts other than the medicinal products to be radiolabelled. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUp to 9 days from the date of manufacture. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, unless the method of withdrawal from the vial or any insertion \ninto the vial preclude the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. \nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \nuser. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in the original package in order to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure. \n \nStorage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive \nmaterials. \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage conditions. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nColourless type I glass 2 mL or 10 mL vial with a V-shaped and flat bottom, respectively, with a \nbromobutyl stopper, closed with an aluminium seal. \n \nThe vials are placed into a lead container for protective shielding and packed in a metallic can and an \nouter carton. \n \nPack size: 1 vial \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nEndolucinBeta is not intended for direct use in patients. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nGeneral warning \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in \ndesignated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the \nregulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation. \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and \npharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. \n \nFor instructions on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 12. \n \nIf at any time in the preparation of this product the integrity of this container is compromised it should \nnot be used. \n \nAdministration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the \nmedicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. \n \nThe surface dose rates and the accumulated dose depend on many factors. Measurements on the \nlocation and during work are critical and should be practiced for more precise and instructive \ndetermination of overall radiation dose to the staff. Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time \nof close contact with patients injected with Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. The use of \ntelevision monitor systems to monitor the patients is recommended. Given the long half-life of \nLutetium (177Lu), it is specially recommended to avoid internal contamination. For this reason it is \nmandatory to use protective high quality (latex/nitrile) gloves in any direct contact with the \nradiopharmaceutical (vial/syringe) and with the patient. For minimising radiation exposure resulting \nfrom repeated exposition there is no recommendation except the strict observance of the above ones. \n \nThe administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or \ncontamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with \nnational regulations must therefore be taken. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material must be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

DOSIMETRY \n \nThe radiation dose received by various organs following intravenous administration of a \nLutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal product is dependent on the specific molecule being radiolabelled. \n \nInformation on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following administration of the \nradiolabelled preparation is available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the \nparticular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \nThe dosimetry table below is presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated \nLutetium (177Lu) to the radiation dose following the administration of a Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled \nmedicinal product or resulting from an accidental intravenous injection of EndolucinBeta. \n \nThe dosimetry estimates were based on a rat biodistribution study performed according to MIRD \npamphlet no.16, and the calculations were performed using the OLINDA 1.1 software package. Time \npoints for measurements were 5 minutes, 1 hour, 12 hours, 2 days, 7 days and 28 days. \n \nTable 2: Estimated organ absorbed radiation doses and effective doses (mSv/MBq) after \n\ninadvertent intravenous administration of 177LuCl3 for various human age classes, \nbased on data collected in rats (n = 24) \n\n \n \n \n \nOrgan \n\nAbsorbed dose per unit radioactivity administered (mSv/MBq) \n\nAdult \n(73.7 kg) \n\n15 years old \n(56.8 kg) \n\n10 years old \n(33.2 kg) \n\n5 years old \n(19.8 kg) \n\n1 year old \n(9.7 kg) \n\nAdrenals 0.2130 0.3070 0.4450 6.0400 0.9120 \nBrain 0.0056 0.0068 0.0089 1.3500 0.0197 \nBreasts 0.0107 0.0134 0.0239 0.0377 0.0697 \nGallbladder Wall 0.1090 0.1240 0.1610 0.2530 0.4500 \nLLI Wall 0.0104 0.0097 0.0167 0.0292 0.0522 \nSmall Intestine 0.1090 0.0244 0.0434 0.0731 0.1260 \nStomach Wall 0.0556 0.0381 0.0648 0.1040 0.1860 \nULI Wall 0.0297 0.0334 0.0609 0.1050 0.1830 \nHeart Wall 0.0415 0.0535 0.0805 0.1190 0.2090 \nKidneys 0.3720 0.4490 0.6460 0.956 1.7200 \nLiver 5.5600 7.5600 11.900 17.900 35.700 \nLungs 0.0574 0.0808 0.1140 0.1720 0.3230 \nMuscle 0.0143 0.0180 0.0260 0.0386 0.0697 \nOvaries 0.0106 0.0129 0.0224 0.0379 0.0709 \nPancreas 0.0663 0.0818 0.1250 0.1900 0.3050 \nRed Marrow 0.5910 0.6670 1.2300 2.6200 6.6000 \nOsteogenic Cells 2.1500 2.8100 4.5900 7.8000 18.800 \nSkin 0.0073 0.0091 0.0140 0.0217 0.0412 \nSpleen 5.7300 8.5000 13.500 21.600 40.700 \nTestes 0.0022 0.0029 0.0049 0.0088 0.0188 \nThymus 0.0102 0.0128 0.0179 0.0276 0.0469 \nThyroid 0.0058 0.0075 0.0113 0.0206 0.0377 \nUrinary Bladder Wall 0.0043 0.0056 0.0116 0.0247 0.0435 \nUterus 0.0085 0.0102 0.0184 0.0331 0.0635 \nRest of Body 0.2330 0.2990 0.5060 0.8380 1.6900 \n      \n\n\n\n12 \n\nEffective Dose \n(mSv/MBq) \n\n \n0.534 \n\n \n0.721 \n\n \n1.160 \n\n \n1.88 \n\n \n3.88 \n\n \nThe effective dose to a 73.7 kg adult resulting from an inadvertently injected intravenous activity of \n1 GBq would be 534 mSv. \n \n \n12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nBefore use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an \nionisation chamber. \n \nLutetium (177Lu) is a beta(-)/gamma emitter. Activity measurements using an ionization chamber are \nvery sensitive to geometric factors and therefore should be performed only under geometric conditions \nwhich have been appropriately validated. \n \nUsual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected. \n \nWithdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened before \ndisinfecting the stopper, the solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single dose syringe \nfitted with suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised \nautomated application system. \n \nIf the integrity of this vial is compromised, the product should not be used. \n \nThe complexing agent and other reagents should be added to the vial with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride. \nFree Lutetium (177Lu) is taken up and accumulates in the bones. This could potentially result in \nosteosarcomas. It is recommended to add a binding agent such as DTPA prior to intravenous \nadministration of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled conjugates in order to form a complex with free \nLutetium (177Lu), if present, leading to a rapid renal clearance of Lutetium (177Lu). \n \nAdequate quality control of the radiochemical purity of ready to use radiopharmaceuticals gained after \nradiolabelling with EndolucinBeta should be assured. Limits for radiochemical impurities should be \nset recognising the radiotoxicological potential of Lutetium (177Lu). Free non-bound Lutetium (177Lu) \nshould be consequently minimised. \n \nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX II \n \n\nA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nEndolucinBeta 40 GBq/mL radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution \nLutetium (177Lu) chloride \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given the medicine combined with EndolucinBeta \nbecause it contains important information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \n\nprocedure. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What EndolucinBeta is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta is used \n3. How the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta is used \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How EndolucinBeta is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What EndolucinBeta is and what it is used for \n \nEndolucinBeta is not a medicine and it is not intended to be used on its own. It has to be used in \ncombination with other medicines (carrier medicines). \n \nEndolucinBeta is a type of product called a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It contains the active \nsubstance Lutetium (177Lu) chloride which gives off beta-radiation, allowing a localised radiation \neffect. This radiation is used to treat certain diseases. \n \nEndolucinBeta has to be combined with a carrier medicine in a process called radiolabelling before \nadministration. The carrier medicine then takes the EndolucinBeta to the disease site in the body. \n \nThese carrier medicines have been specially developed for use with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride and may \nbe substances that have been designed to recognise a particular type of cell in the body. \n \nThe use of a medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta does involve exposure to radioactivity. Your \ndoctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain \nfrom the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. \n \nPlease refer to the package leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta is used \n \nThe medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta must not be used \n- if you are allergic to Lutetium (177Lu) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n- if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant. \n \nPlease refer to the package leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta for \n\n\n\n24 \n\nadditional information. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nEndolucinBeta is not to be administered directly to patients. \nTake special care with the medicine that is radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta: \n- if you have renal impairment or bone marrow disease. \n \nTreatment with Lutetium (177Lu) radioligand therapy may lead to the following side effects \n- a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia) \n- a reduced number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) which are important to stop \n\nbleeding \n- a reduced number of white blood cells (leukopenia, lymphopenia or neutropenia) which are \n\nimportant for protecting the body against infection \n \nMost of these events are mild and only temporary. Because Lutetium (177Lu) can sometimes affect \nyour blood cells, your doctor will do blood tests before you start and at regular intervals during \ntreatment. \n \nDuring peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours, radiolabelled somatostatin \nanalogues are excreted by the kidneys. Your doctor will therefore take a blood test to measure your \nkidney function before you start and during treatment. \n \nTreatment with Lutetium (177Lu) may cause disturbances of liver function. Your doctor will take a \nblood test to monitor your liver function during treatment.  \n \nAfter neuroendocrine tumours are treated with Lutetium (177Lu), patients may experience symptoms \nassociated with release of hormones from the tumour cells, known as a carcinoid crisis. Tell your \ndoctor if you feel faint or dizzy or experience flushing or diarrhoea following your treatment. \n \nTreatment with Lutetium (177Lu) may cause tumour lysis syndrome, due to the rapid breakdown of \ntumour cells. This may result in abnormal blood test results, irregular heartbeat, kidney failure or \nseizures within a week of treatment. Your doctor will perform blood tests to monitor you for this \nsyndrome. Tell your doctor if you have muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, or shortness of \nbreath. \n \nPlease refer to the package leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta for \nadditional warnings and precautions. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nEndolucinBeta is not to be used directly in childrens and adolescent patients under 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and medicines radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines since they may interfere with the procedure. \nIt is not known whether Lutetium (177Lu) chloride may interact with other medicines as specific \nstudies have not been carried out. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of medicines radiolabelled \nwith EndolucinBeta if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or \nif you are breast-feeding. \n \nWhen in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \nprocedure. \n \nIf you are pregnant \nMedicines radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta must not be administered if you are pregnant. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nIf you are breast-feeding \nYou will be asked to stop breast-feeding. \nPlease ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThere could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the medicine used in \ncombination with EndolucinBeta. Please read the package leaflet of that medicine carefully. \n \n \n3. How the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta is used \n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Medicines \nradiolabelled with EndolucinBeta will only be used in special controlled areas. This product will only \nbe handled and given to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons \nwill take special care for the safe use of this product and will keep you informed of their actions. \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of a medicine \nradiolabelled with EndolucinBeta to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to \nachieve the appropriate outcome, depending on the medicine you take with EndolucinBeta and what it \nis used for. \n \nAdministration of the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta and conduct of the procedure \nEndolucinBeta must be used only in combination with another medicine (carrier medicine) which has \nbeen specifically developed and authorised for being combined with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride. The \nadministration will depend on the type of the carrier medicine. Please read the package leaflet of that \nmedicine. \n \nDuration of the procedure \nYour nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. \n \nAfter administration of the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta, you should \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after \nreceiving the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you \nhave any questions. \n \nIf you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta than you should \nSince the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta is handled by a nuclear medicine doctor under \nstrictly controlled conditions, there is only a very small chance of possible overdose. However, in the \ncase of an overdose or an inadvertent intravenous injection of the unlabelled product, you will receive \nappropriate treatment that will remove the radionuclide from the body. \n \nShould you have any further questions on the use of the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta, \nask your nuclear medicine doctor who supervises the procedure. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, the medicine radiolabelled with EndolucinBeta can cause side effects, although not \neverybody gets them. \n \nDry mouth has been reported among patients with prostate cancer receiving treatment with \nLutetium (177Lu) and has been temporary. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n- Reduction in blood cell counts (platelets, red or white blood cells) \n\n\n\n26 \n\n- Nausea \n- Vomiting \n \nSide effects reported among patients treated for neuroendocrine tumors: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n \n- Mild temporary hair loss \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n- Bone marrow cancer (myelodysplastic syndrome) \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \n- Bone marrow cancer (acute myeloid leukaemia) \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n \n- Carcinoid crisis \n- Tumour lysis syndrome (rapid breakdown of tumour cells) \n \nBone marrow cancer (myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia) has been reported in \npatients several years after treatment with Lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for \nneuroendocrine tumours.  \n \nAfter the medicine radiolablelled with EndolucinBeta is administered, it will deliver certain amounts \nof ionising radiation (radioactivity) which can induce a certain risk of cancer and development of \nhereditary defects. In all cases, the risk of the radiation is outweighed by the potential benefit of \nreceiving the radiolabelled medicine. \n \nFor more information, refer to the package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How EndolucinBeta is stored \n \nYou will not have to store this medicine. This medicine is stored under the responsibility of the \nspecialist in appropriate premises. Storage of radiopharmaceuticals will be in accordance with national \nregulation on radioactive materials. \n \nThe following information is intended for the specialist only: \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nEndolucinBeta must not be used after the expiry date and time which is stated on the label after EXP. \nEndolucinBeta will be stored in the original package that provides protection from radiation. \n \n \n6.

It is presented as a clear and colourless \nsolution in a colourless type I glass 2 mL or 10 mL vial with a V-shaped and flat bottom, respectively, \nwith a bromobutyl stopper, closed with an aluminium seal. \nEach pack contains 1 vial placed into a lead container for protective shielding and packed in a metallic \ncan and an outer carton. \n \nThe volume of one vial ranges from 0.075 \u2013 3.75 mL solution (corresponding to 3 \u2013 150 GBq at \nactivity reference time). The volume depends on the quantity of medicine combined with \nEndolucinBeta required for administration by the nuclear medicine doctor. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \n \nITM Medical Isotopes GmbH \nLichtenbergstrasse 1 \nD-85748 Garching \nGermany \nTel: + 49-89-289 139-08 \ninfo@itm.ag \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in {month YYYY} \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nThe complete SmPC of EndolucinBeta is provided as a separate document in the product package, \nwith the objective to provide healthcare professionals with other additional scientific and practical \ninformation about the administration and use of this radiopharmaceutical. \n \nPlease refer to the SmPC. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n \n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS \nOF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nScientific conclusions \n \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for Lutetium (177Lu) chloride, the \nscientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  \n \nFive cases of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) were identified in the scientific literature in association \nwith Lu-177 based radioligand therapy (RLT). The cases occurred in close temporal proximity to the \nRLT, alternative aetiologies were excluded and most cases either met or were close to meeting formal \ncriteria of TLS definition. All cases recovered with treatment. \n \nThe lower bound of the 95 % confidence interval of the reporting odds ratio for tumour lysis syndrome \nin EudraVigilance in association with Lu-177 is increased at 34.50, with 3 cases. These are duplicates \nof those identified in the literature.  \n \nThe PRAC is of the view that although the number of identified cases is limited, the exposure to date \nis relatively low, and the association with tumour lysis syndrome is biologically plausible. The PRAC \ntherefore recommends that the Product Information should be updated accordingly. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for Lutetium (177Lu) chloride the CHMP is of the opinion \nthat the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is \nunchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what endolucinbeta is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "endolucinbeta is not a medicine and it is not intended to be used on its own. it has to be used in combination with other medicines (carrier medicines). endolucinbeta is a type of product called a radiopharmaceutical precursor. it contains the active substance lutetium (177lu) chloride which gives off beta-radiation, allowing a localised radiation effect. this radiation is used to treat certain diseases. endolucinbeta has to be combined with a carrier medicine in a process called radiolabelling before administration. the carrier medicine then takes the endolucinbeta to the disease site in the body. these carrier medicines have been specially developed for use with lutetium (177lu) chloride and may be substances that have been designed to recognise a particular type of cell in the body. the use of a medicine radiolabelled with endolucinbeta does involve exposure to radioactivity. your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. please refer to the package leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with endolucinbeta.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "endolucinbeta", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset":

with endolucinbeta must not be used - if you are allergic to lutetium (177lu) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant. please refer to the package leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with endolucinbeta for 24 additional information. warnings and precautions endolucinbeta is not to be administered directly to patients. take special care with the medicine that is radiolabelled with endolucinbeta: - if you have renal impairment or bone marrow disease. treatment with lutetium (177lu) radioligand therapy may lead to the following side effects - a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia) - a reduced number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) which are important to stop bleeding - a reduced number of white blood cells (leukopenia, lymphopenia or neutropenia) which are important for protecting the body against infection most of these events are mild and only temporary. because lutetium (177lu) can sometimes affect your blood cells, your doctor will do blood tests before you start and at regular intervals during treatment. during peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours, radiolabelled somatostatin analogues are excreted by the kidneys. your doctor will therefore take a blood test to measure your kidney function before you start and during treatment. treatment with lutetium (177lu) may cause disturbances of liver function. your doctor will take a blood test to monitor your liver function during treatment. after neuroendocrine tumours are treated with lutetium (177lu), patients may experience symptoms associated with release of hormones from the tumour cells, known as a carcinoid crisis. tell your doctor if you feel faint or dizzy or experience flushing or diarrhoea following your treatment. treatment with lutetium (177lu) may cause tumour lysis syndrome, due to the rapid breakdown of tumour cells. this may result in abnormal blood test results, irregular heartbeat, kidney failure or seizures within a week of treatment. your doctor will perform blood tests to monitor you for this syndrome. tell your doctor if you have muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, or shortness of breath. please refer to the package leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with endolucinbeta for additional warnings and precautions. children and adolescents endolucinbeta is not to be used directly in childrens and adolescent patients under 18 years old. other medicines and medicines radiolabelled with endolucinbeta tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines since they may interfere with the procedure. it is not known whether lutetium (177lu) chloride may interact with other medicines as specific studies have not been carried out. pregnancy and breast-feeding you must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of medicines radiolabelled with endolucinbeta if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. when in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure. if you are pregnant medicines radiolabelled with endolucinbeta must not be administered if you are pregnant. if you are breast-feeding you will be asked to stop breast-feeding. please ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. driving and using machines there could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the medicine used in combination with endolucinbeta. please read the package leaflet of that medicine carefully.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
