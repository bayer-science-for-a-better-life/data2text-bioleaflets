PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \nThe pH of the solution is 6.8-7.2. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIn adult women \n \n• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to \n\ntreatment with clomifene citrate. \n• Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted \n\nreproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian \ntransfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n• Ovaleap in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the \nstimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical \ntrials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. \n\n \nIn adult men \n \n• Ovaleap is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or \n\nacquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin \n(hCG) therapy. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\n \nTreatment with follitropin alfa should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in \nthe treatment of fertility disorders. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical \nassessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment \nmonitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing \nmedicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. \n \nComparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and \nshorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered \nappropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only \nin order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian \nhyperstimulation (see section 5.1). \n \nWomen with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) \n\nFollitropin alfa may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should \ncommence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. \n \nA commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or \n75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, \nresponse. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring \nfollicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher \nthan 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should \nbe abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence \ntreatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human \nchoriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the \nday of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may \nbe performed. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). \nTreatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \n\nWomen undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro \n\nfertilisation or other ART \n\nA commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin \nalfa daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular \ndevelopment has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or \nultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response, to usually not \n\n\n\n4 \n\nhigher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the \ntenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). \n \nA single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered \n24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. \n \nDown-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now \ncommonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a \ncommonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist \ntreatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, \nfollowing two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the \nfirst 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. \n \nOverall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during \nthe first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. \n \n\nWomen with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency \n\nIn LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of follitropin alfa \ntherapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the \noocyte will be liberated after the administration of hCG. Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of \ndaily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low \nendogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. \n \nA recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment \nshould be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by \nultrasound and oestrogen response. \n \nIf an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day \nintervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of \nstimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. \n \nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to \n10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa \ninjections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG \nadministration. Alternatively, IUI may be performed. \n \nLuteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotropic activity (LH/hCG) \nafter ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. \n \nIf an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should \nrecommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. \n \n\nMen with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism \n\nFollitropin alfa should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a \nminimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment \nmay be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be \nnecessary to achieve spermatogenesis. \n \nSpecial population \n\n \n\nElderly population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of \nfollitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. \n \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \nSafety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment \nhave not been established. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n\n \nOvaleap is intended for subcutaneous use. The first injection should be performed under direct \nmedical supervision. Self-administration should only be performed by patients who are well \nmotivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. \n \nAs the multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to \nthe patients to avoid misuse of the medicine. \n \nThe Ovaleap cartridge is designed for use in conjunction with the Ovaleap Pen only, which is \nseparately available. For instructions on the administration with the Ovaleap Pen, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1; \n• tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland; \n• ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome; \n• gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology; \n• ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma. \n \nOvaleap must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as: \n• primary ovarian failure; \n• malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; \n• fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy; \n• primary testicular insufficiency. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and batch number \nof the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. \n \nGeneral \n\nFollitropin alfa is a potent gonadotropic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions \nand should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their \nmanagement. \n \nGonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health \nprofessionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and \neffective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or \npreferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may \nbe a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH \nin some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the \ntreatment objective should be used in both men and women. \n \nPorphyria \n\nPatients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment \nwith follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of \ntreatment. \n \nTreatment in women \n\n\n\n6 \n\nBefore starting treatment, the couple’s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative \ncontraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for \nhypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment \ngiven. \n \nPatients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or \nART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to \nrecommended follitropin alfa dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy \nwill minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle \ndevelopment and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant \ntests. \n \nIn clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered \nwith lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably \nbe at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. \n \nNo direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been \nperformed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin \nalfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. \n \n\nOvarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \n\nA certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is \nmore commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without \ntreatment. \n \nIn distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with  \nincreasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids and \nan increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, \npleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. \n \nThe following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms \nincluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, \nhaemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, \nhydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian \ntorsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial \ninfarction. \n \nIndependent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or \nrapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation; \n> 3,000 pg/mL or > 11,000 pmol/L in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. \n> 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). \n \nAdherence to recommended follitropin alfa dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk \nof ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound \nscans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. \n \nThere is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may \nbe more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian \nhyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or \n≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain \nfrom coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly \n(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after \nhormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about 7 to 10 days following \ntreatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least 2 weeks after hCG administration. \n \nIn ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nMild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended \nthat gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing and that the patient be hospitalised and \nappropriate therapy be started. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \n\nIn patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared \nwith natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, \nespecially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. \n \nTo minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. \n \nIn patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number \nof embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. \n \nThe patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. \n \n\nPregnancy loss \n\nThe incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing \nstimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. \n \n\nEctopic pregnancy \n\nWomen with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is \nobtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy \nafter ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population. \n \n\nReproductive system neoplasms \n\nThere have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and \nmalignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is \nnot yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in \ninfertile women. \n \n\nCongenital malformation \n\nThe prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous \nconceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, \nsperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. \n \n\nThromboembolic events \n\nIn women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk \nfactors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins \nmay further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the \nbenefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted \nhowever that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. \n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nTreatment in men \n\nElevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are \nunresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective \nresponse cannot be obtained. \n \nSemen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the \nassessment of the response. \n \nBenzalkonium chloride content \n\nOvaleap contains 0.02 mg/mL of benzalkonium chloride \n \n\nBenzyl alcohol content \n\nOvaleap contains 10.0 mg per mL benzyl alcohol \nBenzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \nHigh volumes should be used with caution and only if necessary, especially in subjects with liver or \nkidney impairment as well as in pregnant women or while breast-feeding, because of the risk of \naccumulation and toxicity (metabolic acidosis). \n \nSodium content \n\nOvaleap contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodiumfree”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. \nhCG, clomifene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH \nagonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa \nneeded to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product \ninteraction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \nThere is no indication for use of Ovaleap during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed \npregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or foeto/neonatal toxicity of \nfollitropin alfa. \n \nNo teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during \npregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of follitropin alfa. \n \nBreast-feeding \n\n \nOvaleap is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n\n \nOvaleap is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOvaleap has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site \nreactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). \n \nMild or moderate OHSS has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of \nthe stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4). \n \nThromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within \neach frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTreatment in women \n\n \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions in women \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders Very rare Mild to severe hypersensitivity \n\nreactions, including \nanaphylactic reactions and \nshock \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Headache \nVascular disorders Very rare Thromboembolism (both in \n\nassociation with and separate \nfrom OHSS) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nVery rare Exacerbation or aggravation of \nasthma \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common: Abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, abdominal \ndiscomfort, nausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhoea \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common Ovarian cysts \nCommon Mild or moderate OHSS \n\n(including associated \nsymptomatology) \n\nUncommon Severe OHSS (including \nassociated symptomatology) \n(see section 4.4) \n\nRare Complication of severe OHSS \nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common Injection site reactions (e.g. \npain, erythema, haematoma, \nswelling and/or irritation at the \nsite of injection) \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nTreatment in men \n\n \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions in men \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders Very rare Mild to severe hypersensitivity \n\nreactions, including \nanaphylactic reactions and \nshock \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nVery rare Exacerbation or aggravation of \nasthma \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon: Acne \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Gynaecomastia, varicocele \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common Injection site reactions (e.g. \npain, erythema, haematoma, \nswelling and/or irritation at the \nsite of injection) \n\nInvestigations Common Weight gain \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of an overdose of follitropin alfa are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that \nOHSS may occur (see section 4.4). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, \nATC code: G03GA05. \n \nOvaleap is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \nIn women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the \ndevelopment of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the object of follitropin alfa \ntherapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the \nadministration of hCG. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in women \n\n \nIn clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum \nLH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that \nthere are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nIn clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 3 below) \nand in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total \ndose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. \n \nIn ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in \na higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. \n \nTable 3: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of \nfollitropin alfa with urinary FSH in ART) \n\n follitropin alfa \n(n = 130) \n\nurinary FSH \n(n = 116) \n\nNumber of oocytes retrieved 11.0 ± 5.9 8.8 ± 4.8 \nDays of FSH stimulation required 11.7 ± 1.9 14.5 ± 3.3 \nTotal dose of FSH required (number \nof FSH 75 IU ampoules) \n\n27.6 ± 10.2 40.7 ± 13.6 \n\nNeed to increase the dose (%) 56.2 85.3 \n \nDifferences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for all criteria listed. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in men \n\n \nIn men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months \ninduces spermatogenesis. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with \nan initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about \none day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 L and 0.6 L/h, respectively. \nOne-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70 %. Following repeated \nadministration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days. In women \nwhose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown \nto effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. \n \nImpaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa \n(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. \n \nGiven in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses \nwithout being a teratogen and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary Menopausal \nGonadotropin (hMG). However, since Ovaleap is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited \nclinical relevance. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you use Ovaleap  \n3. How to use Ovaleap \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ovaleap \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ovaleap is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Ovaleap is \nThis medicine contains the active substance follitropin alfa, which is almost identical to a natural \nhormone produced by your body called “follicle-stimulating hormone” (FSH). FSH is a gonadotropin, \na type of hormone that plays an important role in human fertility and reproduction. In women, FSH is \nneeded for the growth and development of the sacs (follicles) in the ovaries that contain the egg cells. \nIn men, FSH is needed for the production of sperm. \n \nWhat Ovaleap is used for \n \nIn adult women, Ovaleap is used: \n• to help ovulation (release of a mature egg cell from the follicle) in women that cannot ovulate \n\nand that have not responded to treatment with a medicine called “clomifene citrate”. \n• to help follicles develop in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures \n\n(procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as “in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete \nintra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. \n\n• in combination with a medicine called “lutropin alfa” (a version of another gonadotropin, \n“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help ovulation in women that are not ovulating because their \nbody is producing too little FSH and LH. \n\n \nIn adult men, Ovaleap is used: \n• in combination with a medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce \n\nsperm in men that are infertile due to low levels of certain hormones. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ovaleap \n \n\nDo not use Ovaleap: \n• if you are allergic to follitropin alfa, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n• if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (parts of the brain). \n• if you are a woman with: \n\n- large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. \n- unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. \n- any condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure \n(early menopause), fibroid tumours of the womb or malformed reproductive organs. \n\n• if you are a man with: \n- testicular failure that is not treatable. \n\n \nDo not use this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before using this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nBefore the treatment is started you and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated by a doctor \nexperienced in treating fertility disorders. \n \nPorphyria \nTell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria. This \nis a condition that may be passed on from parents to children which means that you have an inability \nto break down porphyrins (organic compounds). \nTell your doctor straight away if: \n• your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the \n\nsun, and/or \n• you have stomach, arm or leg pain. \nIf you experience the above symptoms your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. \n \nOvarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) \nIf you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles \ndevelop too much and become large cysts. \n \nTalk to your doctor straight away if: \n• you get pain in the lower part of the abdomen (belly), \n• you gain any weight rapidly, \n• you feel sick or are vomiting, \n• you have difficulty in breathing. \nIf you experience the above symptoms your doctor might ask you to stop using this medicine (see also \nsection 4 under “Serious side effects in women\"). \n \nIf you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and timing are followed, the occurrence of \nOHSS is less likely. Ovaleap treatment seldom causes severe OHSS unless the medicine that is used \nfor final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is given. If you are \ndeveloping OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle. You may be told not \nto have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least 4 days. \n \nMultiple pregnancy \nWhen using this medicine, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child (i.e. \n“multiple pregnancy”, typically twins) than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may lead \nto medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by \nusing the right dose of this medicine at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive \ntechnology the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and number of \nfertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nMiscarriage \nYou are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman when undergoing assisted \nreproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs. \n \nEctopic pregnancy \nYou are more likely to have a pregnancy outside the womb (an ectopic pregnancy) than the average \nwoman when undergoing assisted reproductive technology and if you have damaged fallopian tubes. \n \nBirth defects \nWhen being conceived by assisted reproductive technology, a baby may have a slightly higher risk of \nbirth defects  than after natural conception. This could be related to multiple pregnancies or to parent \ncharacteristics such as maternal age and sperm characteristics. \n \nBlood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) \nIf you have ever had blood clots in your leg or lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if your family have \nexperienced these, inform your doctor. You might have a higher risk of these problems occurring or \nbecoming worse with Ovaleap treatment. \n \nMen with too much FSH in their blood \nIf you are a man, having too much natural FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. This \nmedicine usually does not work if you have this problem. If your doctor decides to try Ovaleap \ntreatment, they may monitor it by asking you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting \ntreatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Ovaleap \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n• If you use Ovaleap with other medicines which help ovulation such as human chorionic \n\ngonadotropin (hCG) or clomifene citrate, this may increase the response of your follicles. \n• If you use Ovaleap at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist or \n\nantagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may \nneed a higher dose of Ovaleap to produce follicles. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou should not use this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nOvaleap contains sodium, benzalkonium chloride and benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \nThis medicine also contains 0.02 mg per mL of benzalkonium chloride and 10.0 mg per mL of benzyl \nalcohol. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease, and if you are \npregnant or breast-feeding. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body \nand may cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). \n \n \n3. How to use Ovaleap \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nThis medicine is given as an injection into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Your \ndoctor or nurse will show you how to inject the medicine. If you administer this medicine to yourself, \nplease carefully read and follow the “Instructions for Use” of the pen.  \nWhat the recommended dose is \nYour doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below \nare stated in International Units (IU). \n \nWomen \n \nIf you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods \n• This medicine is usually given every day. \n• If you have irregular periods, start using this medicine within the first 7 days of your menstrual \n\ncycle. If you do not have periods, you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. \n• The usual starting dose of this medicine is 75 to 150 IU each day. \n• Your dose of this medicine may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until \n\nyou get the desired response. \n• The maximum daily dose of this medicine is usually not higher than 225 IU. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given hCG or “recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an \n\nhCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique). The single injection will be \n250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last Ovaleap \ninjection. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. \nAlternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by placing the sperm into the womb \ncavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with Ovaleap should \nbe stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of this \nmedicine than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG \n[see also section 2 under “Ovarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS)”]. For the following cycle, \nyour doctor will give you a lower dose of Ovaleap than before. \n \nIf you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology \n• The usual starting dose of this medicine is 150 to 225 IU each day, from day 2 or 3 of your \n\nmenstrual cycle. \n• The dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 450 IU. \n• Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes \n\nabout 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests \nand/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. \n\n• When your eggs are ready, you will be given hCG or r-hCG. The single injection will be \n250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last Ovaleap \ninjection. This gets your eggs ready for collection. \n\n \nIn other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then Ovaleap is given approximately 2 weeks after the start \nof agonist treatment. The Ovaleap and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop \nas desired. \n \nIf you are not ovulating, have no periods and have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and \nLH hormones \n• The usual starting dose of Ovaleap is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa. \n• You will use these two medicines each day for up to 5 weeks. \n• Your dose of Ovaleap may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get \n\nthe desired response. \n• When you get the desired response, you will be given hCG or r-hCG. The single injection will \n\nbe 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5,000 to 10,000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last \ninjections of Ovaleap and lutropin alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG \n\n\n\n36 \n\ninjection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed by \nplacing the sperm into the womb cavity. \n\n \nIf your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle should be stopped. For the \nfollowing cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of this medicine than before. \n \nIf your body responds too strongly, your treatment with Ovaleap will be stopped and you will not be \ngiven any hCG [see also section 2 under “Ovarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS)”]. For the \nfollowing cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of Ovaleap than before. \n \nMen \n• The usual dose of this medicine is 150 IU together with hCG. \n• You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. \n• If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you \n\ncontinue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. \n \nHow are the injections given? \nThis medicine is given as an injection into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection) using \nthe Ovaleap Pen. The Ovaleap Pen is a device (a “pen”) used for giving injections into the tissue just \nunder the skin. \n \nYour doctor may suggest that you learn how to inject yourself with this medicine. Your doctor or \nnurse will give you instructions on how to do this and you can also find instructions in the separate \ninstructions for use of the pen. Do not attempt to self-administer this medicine without this training by \nyour doctor or nurse. The very first injection of this medicine should only be given in the presence of a \ndoctor or nurse. \n \nOvaleap solution for injection in cartridges has been developed for use in the Ovaleap Pen. You must \nfollow the separate instructions for use of the Ovaleap Pen carefully. The instructions for use of the \npen will be provided together with the Ovaleap Pen. Proper treatment of your condition, however, \nrequires close and constant co-operation with your doctor. \n \nDiscard used needles immediately after injection. \n \nIf you use more Ovaleap than you should \nThe effects of using too much Ovaleap are unknown. Nevertheless one could expect Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4 under “Serious side \neffects in women\". However, the OHSS will only occur if hCG is also administered [see also section 2 \nunder “Ovarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS)”]. \n \n\nIf you forget to use Ovaleap \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to your doctor as soon as you \nrealise that you forgot a dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nImportant side effects \n \nSerious side effects in men and women \n• Allergic reactions such as skin rash, raised itchy areas of skin and severe allergic reactions with \n\nweakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing and swelling of the face have been \n\n\n\n37 \n\nreported very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). If you think you are having this type \nof reaction, you must stop your Ovaleap injection and get medical help immediately. \n\n \nSerious side effects in women \n• Lower stomach ache together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of Ovarian \n\nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the \ntreatment and that large ovarian cysts developed [see also section 2 under “Ovarian \nHyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS)”]. This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in \n10 people). \n\n• OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, weight \ngain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. This \nside effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n• Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may \naffect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n• Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events), sometimes independent of \nOHSS, may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). This could cause chest \npain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack [see also section 2 under “Blood clotting problems \n(thromboembolic events)”]. \n\nIf you notice any of the above-listed side effects you should immediately contact your doctor who may \nask you to stop using Ovaleap. \n \nOther side effects in women \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \n• Headache \n• Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• Stomach ache \n• Abdominal bloating \n• Abdominal cramps \n• Feeling sick \n• Vomiting \n• Diarrhoea \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nOther side effects in men \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• Swelling of the veins above and behind the testicles (a varicocele) \n• Breast development \n• Acne \n• Weight gain \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n• Your asthma may get worse. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n5.
