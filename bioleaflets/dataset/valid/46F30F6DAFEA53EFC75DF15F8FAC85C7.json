PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSuspension for injection.\n\nThe vaccine is a homogeneous white suspension. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nActive immunisation against disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, \n19F and 23F (including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, bacteraemia and acute otitis media) in infants and \nchildren from 2 months up to 5 years of age (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nFor the number of doses to be administered in the different age groups, see section 4.2.\n\nThe use of Prevenar should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into \nconsideration the impact of invasive disease in different age groups as well as variability of serotype \nepidemiology in different geographical areas (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe immunisation schedules for Prevenar should be based on official recommendations.\n\nInfants aged 2 - 6 months:\nThe primary infant series consists of three doses, each of 0.5 ml, the first dose usually given at 2 months of \nage and with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. A fourth dose is recommended in the second \nyear of life.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nAlternatively, when Prevenar is given as part of a routine infant immunisation programme, a two-dose \nschedule may be considered. The first dose may be given from the age of 2 months with a second dose at \nleast 2 months later and a third (booster) dose at 11-15 months of age (see section 5.1)\n\nPreviously unvaccinated older infants and children:\nInfants aged 7 - 11 months: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. \nA third dose is recommended in the second year of life. \nChildren aged 12 - 23 months: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 2 months between \ndoses.  \nChildren aged 24 months \u2013 5 years: one single dose.\n\nThe need for a booster dose after these immunisation schedules has not been established. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine should be given by intramuscular injection. The preferred sites are anterolateral aspect of the \nthigh (vastus lateralis muscle) in infants or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in young children.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients, or to diphtheria toxoid. \n\nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar should be postponed in subjects suffering from \nacute, severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result \nin the deferral of vaccination.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily \navailable in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.\n\nDo not administer Prevenar intravenously.\n\nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \uf0a3 28 weeks of \ngestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of \nvaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.\n\nPrevenar will not protect against other Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes than those included in the \nvaccine nor other micro-organisms that cause invasive disease or otitis media.\n\nThis vaccine should not be given to infants or children with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder \nthat would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of \nadministration.\n\nAlthough some antibody response to diphtheria toxoid may occur, immunisation with this vaccine does \nnot substitute for routine diphtheria immunisation.\n\nFor children from 2 years through 5 years of age, a single dose immunisation schedule was used. A higher \nrate of local reactions has been observed in children older than 24 months of age compared with infants \n(see section 4.8).\nChildren with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy, a \ngenetic defect, HIV infection, or other causes, may have reduced antibody response to active \nimmunisation.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\nLimited data have demonstrated that Prevenar (three dose primary series) induces an acceptable immune \nresponse in infants with sickle cell disease with a safety profile similar to that observed in non-high-risk \ngroups (see section 5.1).  Safety and immunogenicity data are not yet available for children in other \nspecific high-risk groups for invasive pneumococcal disease (e.g. children with another congenital or \nacquired splenic dysfunction, HIV-infected, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome). Vaccination in high-risk \ngroups should be considered on an individual basis.\n\nChildren below 2 years old should receive the appropriate-for-age Prevenar vaccination series (see section \n4.2). The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccines in children \uf0b3 24 months of age with conditions (such as sickle cell disease, \nasplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness or who are immunocompromised) placing them at higher risk for \ninvasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.  Whenever recommended, children at risk who are \u2265 \n24 months of age and already primed with Prevenar should receive 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine. The interval between the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar) and the 23-\nvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should not be less than 8 weeks.  There are no data available \nto indicate whether the administration of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to unprimed \nchildren or to children primed with Prevenar might result in hyporesponsiveness to further doses of \nPrevenar.\n\nWhen Prevenar is co-administered with hexavalent vaccines (DTaP/Hib(PRP-T)/IPV/HepB), the \nphysician should be aware that data from clinical studies indicate that the rate of febrile reactions was \nhigher compared to that occurring following the administration of hexavalent vaccines alone.  These \nreactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39 \u00b0C) and transient (see section 4.8).  \n\nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines.\n\nProphylactic antipyretic medication is recommended:\n-  for all children receiving Prevenar simultaneously with vaccines containing whole cell pertussis \n\nbecause of higher rate of febrile reactions (see section 4.8).\n-  for children with seizure disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Prevenar may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine from pneumococcal \ndisease.  Additionally, for vaccine serotypes, protection against otitis media is expected to be substantially \nlower than protection against invasive disease.  As otitis media is caused by many organisms other than \npneumococcal serotypes represented in the vaccine, protection against all otitis media is expected to be \nlow (see section 5.1).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPrevenar can be administered simultaneously with other paediatric vaccines in accordance with the \nrecommended immunisation schedules. Different injectable vaccines should always be given at different \ninjection sites.\n\nThe immune response to routine paediatric vaccines co-administered with Prevenar at different injection \nsites was assessed in 7 controlled clinical studies.  The antibody response to Hib tetanus protein conjugate \n(PRP-T), tetanus and Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines was similar to controls.  For CRM-based Hib conjugate \nvaccine, enhancement of antibody responses to Hib and diphtheria in the infant series was observed.  At \nthe booster, some suppression of Hib antibody level was observed but all children had protective levels. \nInconsistent reduction in response to pertussis antigens as well as to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) were \nobserved. The clinical relevance of these interactions is unknown. Limited results from open label studies \nshowed an acceptable response to MMR and varicella. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nData on concomitant administration of Prevenar with Infanrix hexa (DTaP/Hib(PRP-T)/IPV/HepB \nvaccine) have shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the individual \nantigens when given as a 3 dose primary vaccination.\nSufficient data regarding interference on the concomitant administration of other hexavalent vaccines with \nPrevenar are currently not available. \n\nIn a clinical trial that compared separate with concomitant administrations of Prevenar (three doses at 2, \n3.5, 6 months and a booster dose at approximately 12 months) and Meningitec (meningococcal C \nconjugate vaccine; two doses at 2 and 6 months and a booster dose at approximately 12 months) there was \nno evidence of immune interference between the two conjugate vaccines after the primary series or after \nthe booster doses.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPrevenar is not intended for use in adults. Human data on the use during pregnancy or lactation and animal \nreproduction studies are not available.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNot relevant.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nThe safety of the vaccine was assessed in different controlled clinical studies in which more than 18,000 \nhealthy infants (6 weeks to 18 months) were included. The majority of the safety experience comes from \nthe efficacy trial in which 17,066 infants received 55,352 doses of Prevenar. Also safety in previously \nunvaccinated older children has been assessed.\n\nIn all studies, Prevenar was administered concurrently with the recommended childhood vaccines.\n\nAmongst the most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions and fever.\n\nNo consistent increased local or systemic reactions within repeated doses were seen throughout the \nprimary series or with the booster dose, the exceptions being a higher rate of transient tenderness (36.5 %) \nand tenderness that interfered with limb movement (18.5 %) were seen with the booster dose.\n\nIn older children receiving a single dose of vaccine, a higher rate of local reactions has been observed than \nthat previously described in infancy. These reactions were primarily transient in nature. In a post licensure \nstudy involving 115 children between 2-5 years of age, tenderness was reported in up to 39.1 % of \nchildren; in 15.7 % of children the tenderness interfered with limb movement. Redness was reported in \n40.0 % of children, and induration was reported in 32.2 % of subjects. Redness or induration >2cm in \ndiameter was reported in 22.6 % and 13.9 % of children respectively.\n\nWhen Prevenar is co-administered with hexavalent vaccines (DTaP/Hib(PRP-T)/IPV/HepB), fever \n\u2265 38 \u00b0C per dose was reported in 28.3 % to 48.3 % of infants in the group receiving Prevenar and the \nhexavalent vaccine at the same time as compared to 15.6 % to 23.4 % in the group receiving the \nhexavalent vaccine alone.  Fever of greater than 39.5 \u00b0C per dose was observed in 0.6 to 2.8 % of infants \nreceiving Prevenar and hexavalent vaccines (see section 4.4). \n\nReactogenicity was higher in children receiving whole cell pertussis vaccines concurrently.  In a study, \nincluding 1,662 children, fever of \uf0b3 38 \u00b0C was reported in 41.2 % of children who received Prevenar \nsimultaneously with DTP as compared to 27.9 % in the control group. Fever of > 39 \u00b0C was reported in \n3.3 % of children compared to 1.2 % in the control group.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nAdverse reactions reported in clinical trials or from the post-marketing experience are listed in the \nfollowing table per system organ class and per frequency and this is for all age groups.  \n\nThe frequency is defined as follows: \nVery common( \uf0b3 1/10)\nCommon (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10)\nUncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100)\nRare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)\nVery rare (< 1/10,000)\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\nVery rare: Lymphadenopathy localised to the region of the injection site\n\nImmune system disorders:\nRare: Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions including \n\nshock, angioneurotic oedema, bronchospasm, dyspnoea, face oedema.\n\nNervous system disorders:\nRare: Seizures, including febrile seizures.\n\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nVery common: Vomiting, diarrhoea, decreased appetite.\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nUncommon: Rash/urticaria.\nVery rare: Erythema multiforme.\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. erythema, induration/swelling, pain/tenderness); fever \n\n\uf0b3 38 \u00b0C, irritability, crying, drowsiness, restless sleep.\nCommon: Injection site swelling/induration and erythema >2.4 cm, tenderness interfering \n\nwith movement, fever > 39 \u00b0C.\nRare: Hypotonic hyporesponsive episode, injection site hypersensitivity reactions (eg., \n\ndermatitis, pruritus, urticaria), flushing.\n\nApnoea in very premature infants (\uf0a3 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4).\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere have been reports of overdose with Prevenar, including cases of administration of a higher than \nrecommended dose and cases of subsequent doses administered closer than recommended to the previous \ndose. No undesirable effects were reported in the majority of individuals. In general, adverse reactions\nreported with overdose have also been reported with recommended single doses of Prevenar.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: pneumococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AL02\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nSignificant increases in antibody (measured by ELISA) were seen for all vaccine serotypes following a \nthree-dose primary series of Prevenar in infants and following booster doses although geometric mean \nconcentrations varied between the 7 serotypes. Prevenar has also been shown to elicit functional \nantibodies (measured by opsonophagocytosis) to all vaccine serotypes following the primary series. Long-\nterm persistence of antibodies has not been investigated after administration of a primary series in infants \nplus booster or after administration of single priming doses to older children. Administration \nof unconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharides at 13 months following the primary series with Prevenar \nelicited an anamnestic antibody response for the 7 serotypes included in the vaccine, indicating \nthat priming had occurred. \n\nThe immunogenicity of a two-dose primary series in infants plus a booster at about one year of age has \nbeen documented in several studies. Most of the data have indicated that smaller proportions of infants \nachieved antibody concentrations \u22650.35 \u03bcg/ml  (the reference antibody concentration recommended by \nWHO)1 against serotypes 6B and 23F after two-dose primary series when directly or indirectly compared \nwith three-dose primary series. In addition, GMCs were lower for antibodies to most serotypes after a two-\ndose infant series than after a three-dose infant series. However, antibody responses to booster doses \nin toddlers following two-dose or three-dose infant series were comparable for all 7 vaccine serotypes and \nindicated that both infant regimens had elicited adequate priming.\n\nSignificant increases in antibody (measured by ELISA) to all vaccine serotypes were seen \nafter administration of single doses of Prevenar to children aged 2 to 5 years. Antibody concentrations \nwere similar to those achieved following a three-dose infant series and a booster dose at less than 2 years \nof age. Efficacy trials in the 2- to 5-year-old population have not been conducted. \n\nClinical trial efficacy of the two-dose infant primary series plus a booster has not been established, and the \nclinical consequences of lower antibody concentrations against serotypes 6B and 23F after the two-dose \ninfant series are not known.\n\nEfficacy against invasive disease\n\nEstimates of efficacy against invasive disease were obtained in the US population where vaccine serotype \ncoverage ranged from 80 to 89 %. Epidemiological data between 1988 and 2003 indicated that in Europe \ncoverage is lower and varies from country to country.  Consequently, Prevenar should cover between 54 \n% and 84 % of isolates from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in European children less than 2 years \nof age.  In European children between 2 to 5 years of age, Prevenar should cover about 62 % to 83 % of \nthe clinical isolates responsible for invasive pneumococcal disease.  It is estimated that more than 80 % of \nthe antimicrobial resistant strains would be covered by the serotypes included in the vaccine. The vaccine \nserotype coverage in the paediatric population decreases with increasing age. The decrease in the \nincidence of IPD seen in older children may be partly due to naturally acquired immunity.\n\nEfficacy against invasive disease was assessed in a large-scale randomised, double-blind, clinical trial in a \nmultiethnic population in Northern California (Kaiser Permanente trial).  More than 37,816 infants were \nimmunised with either Prevenar or a control vaccine (meningococcal conjugate group C vaccine), at 2, 4, \n6 and 12-15 months of age. At the time of the study, the serotypes included in the vaccine accounted for \n89 % of IPD.\n\nA total of 52 cases of invasive disease caused by vaccine serotypes had accumulated in a blinded follow-\nup period through April 20, 1999.  The estimate of vaccine serotype specific efficacy was 94 % (95 % CI: \n81, 99) in the intent-to-treat population and 97 % (95 % CI: 85, 100) in the per protocol (fully immunized) \npopulation (40 cases).  In Europe, the estimates of effectiveness in children less than 2 years of age range \nfrom 51 % to 79 % when considering vaccine coverage against serotypes causing invasive disease.\n\n                                                     \n1 WHO technical report No 927, 2005; Appendix serological criteria for calculation and licensure of new \n\npneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulations for use in infants. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8\n\nEfficacy against pneumonia\n\nIn the Kaiser Permanente trial, efficacy was 87.5 % (95 % CI: 7, 99) against bacteraemic pneumonia due \nto vaccine serotypes of S. pneumoniae.\n\nEffectiveness (no microbiological confirmation of diagnosis was performed) against non-bacteraemic \npneumonia was also assessed. As many pathogens other than pneumococcal serotypes represented in the \nvaccine may contribute to the burden of pneumonia in children, protection against all clinical pneumonia \nis expected to be lower than for invasive pneumococcal disease.  In the per-protocol analysis, the \nestimated risk reduction for the first episode of clinical pneumonia with abnormal chest radiograph \n(defined as the presence of infiltrates, effusion or consolidation) was 35 % (95 % CI: 4, 56).\n\nEfficacy against otitis media\n\nAcute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood disease with different aetiologies.  Bacteria can be \nresponsible for 60-70% of clinical episodes of AOM. The pneumococcus is responsible for 30-40% of all \nbacterial AOM and a greater fraction of severe AOM.  Theoretically, Prevenar could prevent about 60-\n80% of serotypes causing pneumococcal AOM.  It is estimated that Prevenar could prevent 6-13% of all \nclinical episodes of AOM.\n\nEfficacy of Prevenar against acute otitis media (AOM) was assessed in a randomised, double blind, \nclinical trial of 1,662 Finnish infants immunised with either Prevenar or a control vaccine (Hepatitis B \nvaccine), at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age. The estimate for vaccine efficacy against vaccine-serotype \nAOM, the primary endpoint of the trial, was 57 % (95 % CI: 44, 67) in the per-protocol analysis and 54 % \n(95 % CI: 41, 64) in the intent-to-treat analysis.  A 33 % (95 % CI: -1, 80) increase in AOM due to \nserogroups not included in the vaccine was observed in immunised subjects.  However, the overall benefit \nwas a 34 % (95 % CI: 21, 45) reduction in the incidence of all pneumococcal AOM.  The impact of the \nvaccine on total number of episodes of otitis media regardless of etiology was a 6 % (95 % CI: -4, 16) \nreduction. \n\nA subset of children in this study were followed until they reached 4 to 5 years of age.  In this follow-up, \nvaccine efficacy for frequent OM (defined as at least 3 episodes within 6 months) was 18 % (95 % CI: 1, \n32), for chronic otitis media with effusion, 50 % (95 % CI: 15, 71), and for tympanostomy tube placement, \n39 % (95 % CI: 4, 61). \n\nEfficacy of Prevenar against AOM was assessed as a secondary endpoint in the Kaiser Permanente trial.  \nChildren were followed until 3.5 years of age.  The impact of the vaccine on total number of episodes of \notitis media regardless of etiology was a 7 % reduction (95 % CI: 4, 10).  The effect of the vaccine in the \nper-protocol analysis was a 9 % reduction (95 % CI: 3, 15) in recurrent AOM (defined as 3 episodes in six \nmonths or 4 episodes in one year) or a 23 % (95 % CI: 7, 36) reduction for recurrent AOM (5 episodes in \nsix months or 6 episodes in one year).  Tympanostomy tube placement was reduced by 24 % (95 % CI: 12, \n35) in the per-protocol analysis and by 23 % (95 % CI: 11, 34) in the intent-to-treat analysis.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness of Prevenar against IPD (i.e. comprising the protection afforded by vaccination \nand from herd immunity due to reduced transmission of vaccine serotypes in the population) has been \nevaluated in national immunisation programmes that employ three-dose or two-dose infant series, each \nwith booster doses.\n\nIn the USA, generalised vaccination with Prevenar using a four-dose series in infants and a catch-up \nprogramme for children up to 5 years of age was introduced in 2000. Vaccine effectiveness against IPD \ncaused by vaccine serotypes was evaluated in 3- to 59-month old children within the first four years of the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9\n\nimplementation of the programme. When compared with no vaccination, point estimates for the \neffectiveness of 2-, 3-, or 4-doses given on an infant schedule were similar: 96% (95% CI 88-99); 95% \n(95% CI 88-99); and 100% (95% CI 94-100), respectively. In the USA in the same time frame, there was a \n94% reduction in vaccine type IPD in individuals under 5 years of age, compared to a pre-vaccine baseline \n(1998/99). In parallel, there was a 62% reduction in vaccine type IPD in individuals over 5 years of age. \nThis indirect or herd effect is due to a reduction in transmission of vaccine serotypes from immunised \nyoung children to the rest of the population and coincides with decreased nasopharyngeal carriage of \nvaccine serotypes. \n\nIn Quebec, Canada Prevenar was introduced at 2, 4 and 12 months of age with a single dose catch-up \nprogramme in children up to 5 years of age. In the first two years of the programme, with over 90% \ncoverage, the observed effectiveness against IPD caused by vaccine serotypes was 93% (95% CI 75-98) \nfor the 2 dose infant series and 100% (95% CI 91-100) for the completed schedule. \n\nPreliminary data from England and Wales reported less than 1 year following introduction of routine \nimmunisation at 2, 4 and 13 months with a single dose catch-up programme for children 13 to 23 months \nof age have suggested that effectiveness of this schedule might be lower against serotype 6B than against \nthe other serotypes in the vaccine.\nThe effectiveness of a two-dose primary series has not been established against pneumonia or acute otitis \nmedia.\n\nAdditional immunogenicity data\n\nThe immunogenicity of Prevenar has been investigated in an open-label, multicenter study in 49 infants \nwith sickle cell disease. Children were vaccinated with Prevenar (3 doses one month apart from the age of \n2 months) and 46 of these children also received a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at the \nage of 15-18 months. After primary immunisation, 95.6% of the subjects had antibody levels of at least \n0.35 \u00b5g/ml for all seven serotypes found in Prevenar. A significant increase was seen in the concentrations \nof antibodies against the seven serotypes after the polysaccharide vaccination, suggesting that \nimmunological memory was well established.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nA repeated dose intramuscular toxicity study (13 weeks, 5 injections, one every three weeks) of \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine in rabbits revealed no evidence of any significant local or systemic toxic \neffects.\n\nRepeated dose subcutaneous toxicity studies (13 weeks, 7 injections of the clinical dose, one every other \nweek, followed by a 4-week recovery period) of Prevenar in rats and monkeys revealed no evidence of \nany significant local or systemic toxic effects.\n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe.\n\nThe vaccine is a homogeneous white suspension.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nActive immunisation against disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, \n19F and 23F (including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, bacteraemia and acute otitis media) in infants and \nchildren from 2 months up to 5 years of age (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nFor the number of doses to be administered in the different age groups, see section 4.2.\n\nThe use of Prevenar should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into \nconsideration the impact of invasive disease in different age groups as well as variability of serotype \nepidemiology in different geographical areas (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe immunisation schedules for Prevenar should be based on official recommendations.\n\nInfants aged 2 - 6 months: \nThe primary infant series consists of three doses, each of 0.5 ml, the first dose usually given at 2 months of \nage and with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. A fourth dose is recommended in the second \nyear of life.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13\n\nAlternatively, when Prevenar is given as part of a routine infant immunisation programme, a two-dose \nschedule may be considered. The first dose may be given from the age of 2 months with a second dose at \nleast 2 months later and a third (booster) dose at 11-15 months of age (see section 5.1)\n\nPreviously unvaccinated older infants and children:\nInfants aged 7 - 11 months: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. \nA third dose is recommended in the second year of life.\nChildren aged 12 - 23 months: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 2 months between \ndoses.\nChildren aged 24 months \u2013 5 years: one single dose.\n\nThe need for a booster dose after these immunisation schedules has not been established.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine should be given by intramuscular injection. The preferred sites are anterolateral aspect of the \nthigh (vastus lateralis muscle) in infants or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in young children.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients, or to diphtheria toxoid. \n\nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar should be postponed in subjects suffering from \nacute, severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result \nin the deferral of vaccination.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily \navailable in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.\n\nDo not administer Prevenar intravenously.\n\nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered \nwhen administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \uf0a3 28 weeks of \ngestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of \nvaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.\n\nPrevenar will not protect against other Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes than those included in the \nvaccine nor other micro-organisms that cause invasive disease or otitis media.\n\nThis vaccine should not be given to infants or children with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder \nthat would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of \nadministration.\n\nAlthough some antibody response to diphtheria toxoid may occur, immunisation with this vaccine does \nnot substitute for routine diphtheria immunisation.\n\nFor children from 2 years through 5 years of age, a single dose immunisation schedule was used. A higher \nrate of local reactions has been observed in children older than 24 months of age compared with infants \n(see section 4.8).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14\n\nChildren with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy, a \ngenetic defect, HIV infection, or other causes, may have reduced antibody response to active \nimmunisation.\n\nLimited data have demonstrated that Prevenar (three dose primary series) induces an acceptable immune \nresponse in infants with sickle cell disease with a safety profile similar to that observed in non-high-risk \ngroups (see section 5.1).  Safety and immunogenicity data are not yet available for children in other \nspecific high-risk groups for invasive pneumococcal disease (e.g. children with another congenital or \nacquired splenic dysfunction, HIV-infected, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome). Vaccination in high-risk \ngroups should be considered on an individual basis. \n\nChildren below 2 years old should receive the appropriate-for-age Prevenar vaccination series (see section \n4.2). The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccines in children \uf0b3 24 months of age with conditions (such as sickle cell disease, \nasplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness or who are immunocompromised) placing them at higher risk for \ninvasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.  Whenever recommended, children at risk who are \u2265 \n24 months of age and already primed with Prevenar should receive 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine. The interval between the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar) and the 23-\nvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should not be less than 8 weeks.  There are no data available \nto indicate whether the administration of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to unprimed \nchildren or to children primed with Prevenar might result in hyporesponsiveness to further doses of \nPrevenar.\n\nWhen Prevenar is co-administered with hexavalent vaccines (DTaP/Hib(PRP-T)/IPV/HepB), the \nphysician should be aware that data from clinical studies indicate that the rate of febrile reactions was \nhigher compared to that occurring following the administration of hexavalent vaccines alone.  These \nreactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39 \u00b0C) and transient (see section 4.8).\n\nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines.\n\nProphylactic antipyretic medication is recommended:\n-  for all children receiving Prevenar simultaneously with vaccines containing whole cell pertussis \n\nbecause of higher rate of febrile reactions (see section 4.8).\n-  for children with seizure disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Prevenar may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine from pneumococcal \ndisease.  Additionally, for vaccine serotypes, protection against otitis media is expected to be substantially \nlower than protection against invasive disease.  As otitis media is caused by many organisms other than \npneumococcal serotypes represented in the vaccine, protection against all otitis media is expected to be \nlow (see section 5.1).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPrevenar can be administered simultaneously with other paediatric vaccines in accordance with the \nrecommended immunisation schedules. Different injectable vaccines should always be given at different \ninjection sites.\n\nThe immune response to routine paediatric vaccines co-administered with Prevenar at different injection \nsites was assessed in 7 controlled clinical studies.  The antibody response to Hib tetanus protein conjugate \n(PRP-T), tetanus and Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines was similar to controls.  For CRM-based Hib conjugate \nvaccine, enhancement of antibody responses to Hib and diphtheria in the infant series was observed.  At \nthe booster, some suppression of Hib antibody level was observed but all children had protective levels. \nInconsistent reduction in response to pertussis antigens as well as to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) were \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15\n\nobserved. The clinical relevance of these interactions is unknown.  Limited results from open label studies \nshowed an acceptable response to MMR and varicella. \n\nData on concomitant administration of Prevenar with Infanrix hexa (DTaP/Hib(PRP-T)/IPV/HepB \nvaccine) have shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the individual \nantigens when given as a 3 dose primary vaccination.\nSufficient data regarding interference on the concomitant administration of other hexavalent vaccines with \nPrevenar are currently not available. \n\nIn a clinical trial that compared separate with concomitant administrations of Prevenar (three doses at 2, \n3.5, 6 months and a booster dose at approximately 12 months) and Meningitec (meningococcal C \nconjugate vaccine; two doses at 2 and 6 months and a booster dose at approximately 12 months) there was \nno evidence of immune interference between the two conjugate vaccines after the primary series or after \nthe booster doses.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPrevenar is not intended for use in adults. Human data on the use during pregnancy or lactation and animal \nreproduction studies are not available.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNot relevant.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nThe safety of the vaccine was assessed in different controlled clinical studies in which more than 18,000 \nhealthy infants (6 weeks to 18 months) were included. The majority of the safety experience comes from \nthe efficacy trial in which 17,066 infants received 55,352 doses of Prevenar. Also safety in previously \nunvaccinated older children has been assessed.\n\nIn all studies, Prevenar was administered concurrently with the recommended childhood vaccines.\n\nAmongst the most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions and fever.\n\nNo consistent increased local or systemic reactions within repeated doses were seen throughout the \nprimary series or with the booster dose, the exceptions being a higher rate of transient tenderness (36.5 %) \nand tenderness that interfered with limb movement (18.5 %) were seen with the booster dose.\n\nIn older children receiving a single dose of vaccine, a higher rate of local reactions has been observed than \nthat previously described in infancy. These reactions were primarily transient in nature. In a post licensure \nstudy involving 115 children between 2-5 years of age, tenderness was reported in 39.1 % of children; in \n15.7 % of children the tenderness interfered with limb movement. Redness was reported in 40.0 % of \nchildren, and induration was reported in 32.2 % of subjects. Redness or induration >2cm in diameter was \nreported in 22.6 % and 13.9% of children respectively.\n\nWhen Prevenar is co-administered with hexavalent vaccines (DTaP/Hib(PRP-T)/IPV/HepB), fever \u2265 38 \n\u00b0C per dose was reported in 28.3 % to 48.3 % of infants in the group receiving Prevenar and the \nhexavalent vaccine at the same time as compared to 15.6 % to 23.4 % in the group receiving the \nhexavalent vaccine alone.  Fever of greater than 39.5 \u00b0C per dose was observed in 0.6 to 2.8 % of infants \nreceiving Prevenar and hexavalent vaccines (see section 4.4).\n\nReactogenicity was higher in children receiving whole cell pertussis vaccines concurrently.  In a study, \nincluding 1,662 children, fever of \uf0b3 38 \u00b0C was reported in 41.2 % of children who received Prevenar \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16\n\nsimultaneously with DTP as compared to 27.9 % in the control group. Fever of > 39 \u00b0C was reported in \n3.3 % of children compared to 1.2 % in the control group.\n\nAdverse reactions reported in clinical trials or from the post-marketing experience are listed in the \nfollowing table per system organ class and per frequency and this is for all age groups.  \n\nThe frequency is defined as follows:\nVery common (\uf0b3 1/10)\nCommon (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10)\nUncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100)\nRare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)\nVery rare (< 1/10,000)\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders:\nVery rare:  Lymphadenopathy localised to the region of the injection site\n\nImmune system disorders:\nRare: Hypersensitivity reactions such as, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions including \n\nshock, angioneurotic oedema, bronchospasm, dyspnoea, face oedema. \n\nNervous system disorders:\nRare: Seizures, including febrile seizures.\n\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nVery common: Vomiting, diarrhoea, decreased appetite.\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nUncommon: Rash/urticaria.\nVery rare: Erythema multiforme.\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions:\nVery common: Injection site reactions (e.g. erythema, induration/swelling, pain/tenderness); fever \n\n\uf0b3 38 \u00b0C, irritability, crying, drowsiness, restless sleep.\nCommon: Injection site swelling/induration and erythema >2.4 cm, tenderness interfering \n\nwith movement, fever > 39 \u00b0C.\nRare: Hypotonic hyporesponsive episode, injection site hypersensitivity reactions (eg., \n\ndermatitis, pruritus, urticaria), flushing.\n\nApnoea in very premature infants (\uf0a3 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4).\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere have been reports of overdose with Prevenar, including cases of administration of a higher than \nrecommended dose and cases of subsequent doses administered closer than recommended to the previous \ndose. No undesirable effects were reported in the majority of individuals. In general, adverse reactions \nreported with overdose have also been reported with recommended single doses of Prevenar.Me\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n17\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: pneumococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AL02\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nSignificant increases in antibody (measured by ELISA) were seen for all vaccine serotypes following a \nthree-dose primary series of Prevenar in infants and following booster doses although geometric mean \nconcentrations varied between the 7 serotypes. Prevenar has also been shown to elicit functional \nantibodies (measured by opsonophagocytosis) to all vaccine serotypes following the primary series. Long-\nterm persistence of antibodies has not been investigated after administration of a primary series in infants \nplus booster or after administration of single priming doses to older children. Administration \nof unconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharides at 13 months following the primary series with Prevenar \nelicited an anamnestic antibody response for the 7 serotypes included in the vaccine, indicating \nthat priming had occurred. \n\nThe immunogenicity of a two-dose primary series in infants plus a booster at about one year of age has \nbeen documented in several studies. Most of the data have indicated that smaller proportions of infants \nachieved antibody concentrations \u22650.35 \u03bcg/ml  (the reference antibody concentration recommended by \nWHO)2 against serotypes 6B and 23F after two-dose primary series when directly or indirectly compared \nwith three-dose primary series. In addition, GMCs were lower for antibodies to most serotypes after a two-\ndose infant series than after a three-dose infant series. However, antibody responses to booster doses \nin toddlers following two-dose or three-dose infant series were comparable for all 7 vaccine serotypes and\nindicated that both infant regimens had elicited adequate priming.\nSignificant increases in antibody (measured by ELISA) to all vaccine serotypes were seen \nafter administration of single doses of Prevenar to children aged 2 to 5 years. Antibody concentrations \nwere similar to those achieved following a three-dose infant series and a booster dose at less than 2 years \nof age. Efficacy trials in the 2- to 5-year-old population have not been conducted.\n\nClinical trial efficacy of the two-dose infant primary series plus a booster has not been established, and the \nclinical consequences of lower antibody concentrations against serotypes 6B and 23F after the two-dose \ninfant series are not known.\n\nEfficacy against invasive disease\n\nEstimates of efficacy against invasive disease were obtained in the US population where vaccine serotype \ncoverage ranged from 80 to 89 %. Epidemiological data between 1988 and 2003 indicated that in Europe \ncoverage is lower and varies from country to country.  Consequently, Prevenar should cover between 54 \n% and 84 % of isolates from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in European children less than 2 years \nof age. In European children between 2 to 5 years of age, Prevenar should cover about 62 % to 83 % of the \nclinical isolates responsible for invasive pneumococcal disease. It is estimated that more than 80 % of the \nantimicrobial resistant strains would be covered by the serotypes included in the vaccine. The vaccine \nserotype coverage in the paediatric population decreases with increasing age. The decrease in the \nincidence of IPD seen in older children may be partly due to naturally acquired immunity.\n\nEfficacy against invasive disease was assessed in a large-scale randomised, double-blind, clinical trial in a \nmultiethnic population in Northern California (Kaiser Permanente trial).  More than 37,816 infants were \nimmunised with either Prevenar or a control vaccine (meningococcal conjugate group C vaccine), at 2, 4, \n\n                                                     \n2 WHO technical report No 927, 2005; Appendix serological criteria for calculation and licensure of new \n\npneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulations for use in infants. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18\n\n6 and 12-15 months of age. At the time of the study, the serotypes included in the vaccine accounted for \n89 % of IPD.  \nA total of 52 cases of invasive disease caused by vaccine serotypes had accumulated in a blinded follow-\nup period through April 20, 1999. The estimate of vaccine serotype specific efficacy was 94 % (95 % CI: \n81, 99) in the intent-to-treat population and 97 % (95 % CI: 85, 100) in the per protocol (fully immunised) \npopulation (40 cases).  In Europe, the estimates of effectiveness in children less than 2 years of age range \nfrom 51 % to 79 % when considering vaccine coverage against serotypes causing invasive disease.\n\nEfficacy against pneumonia\n\nIn the Kaiser Permanente trial, efficacy was 87.5 % (95 % CI: 7, 99) against bacteraemic pneumonia due \nto vaccine serotypes of S. pneumoniae.\n\nEffectiveness (no microbiological confirmation of diagnosis was performed) against non-bacteraemic \npneumonia was also assessed.  As many pathogens other than pneumococcal serotypes represented in the \nvaccine may contribute to the burden of pneumonia in children, protection against all clinical pneumonia \nis expected to be lower than for invasive pneumococcal disease.  In the per-protocol analysis, the \nestimated risk reduction for the first episode of clinical pneumonia with abnormal chest radiograph \n(defined as the presence of infiltrates, effusion or consolidation) was 35 % (95 % CI: 4, 56).\n\nEfficacy against otitis media\n\nAcute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood disease with different aetiologies.  Bacteria can be \nresponsible for 60-70% of clinical episodes of AOM. The pneumococcus is responsible for 30-40% of all \nbacterial AOM and a greater fraction of severe AOM.  Theoretically, Prevenar could prevent about 60-\n80% of serotypes causing pneumococcal AOM.  It is estimated that Prevenar could prevent 6-13% of all \nclinical episodes of AOM.\n\nEfficacy of Prevenar against acute otitis media (AOM) was assessed in a randomised, double blind, \nclinical trial of 1,662 Finnish infants immunised with either Prevenar or a control vaccine (Hepatitis B \nvaccine), at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age. The estimate for vaccine efficacy against vaccine-serotype \nAOM, the primary endpoint of the trial, was 57 % (95 % CI: 44, 67) in the per-protocol analysis and 54 % \n(95 % CI: 41, 64) in the intent-to-treat analysis.  A 33 % (95 % CI: -1, 80) increase in AOM due to \nserogroups not included in the vaccine was observed in immunised subjects.  However, the overall benefit \nwas a 34 % (95 % CI: 21, 45) reduction in the incidence of all pneumococcal AOM.  The impact of the \nvaccine on total number of episodes of otitis media regardless of etiology was a 6 % (95 % CI: -4, 16) \nreduction. \n\nA subset of children in this study were followed until they reached 4 to 5 years of age.  In this follow-up, \nvaccine efficacy for frequent OM (defined as at least 3 episodes within 6 months) was 18 % (95 % CI: 1, \n32), for chronic otitis media with effusion, 50 % (95 % CI: 15, 71), and for tympanostomy tube placement, \n39 % (95 % CI: 4, 61). \n\nEfficacy of Prevenar against AOM was assessed as a secondary endpoint in the Kaiser Permanente trial.  \nChildren were followed until 3.5 years of age.  The impact of the vaccine on total number of episodes of \notitis media regardless of etiology was a 7 % reduction (95 % CI: 4, 10).  The effect of the vaccine in the \nper-protocol analysis was a 9 % reduction (95 % CI: 3, 15) in recurrent AOM (defined as 3 episodes in six \nmonths or 4 episodes in one year) or a 23 % (95 % CI: 7,36) reduction for recurrent AOM (5 episodes in \nsix months or 6 episodes in one year).  Tympanostomy tube placement was reduced by 24 % (95 % CI: 12, \n35) in the per-protocol analysis and by 23 % (95 % CI: 11, 34) in the intent-to-treat analysis.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19\n\nEffectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness of Prevenar against IPD (i.e. comprising the protection afforded by vaccination \nand from herd immunity due to reduced transmission of vaccine serotypes in the population) has been \nevaluated in national immunisation programmes that employ three-dose or two-dose infant series, each \nwith booster doses.\n\nIn the USA, generalised vaccination with Prevenar using a four-dose series in infants and a catch-up \nprogramme for children up to 5 years of age was introduced in 2000. Vaccine effectiveness against IPD \ncaused by vaccine serotypes was evaluated in 3- to 59-month old children within the first four years of the \nimplementation of the programme. When compared with no vaccination, point estimates for the \neffectiveness of 2-, 3-, or 4-doses given on an infant schedule were similar: 96% (95% CI 88-99); 95% \n(95% CI 88-99); and 100% (95% CI 94-100), respectively. In the USA in the same time frame, there was a \n94% reduction in vaccine type IPD in individuals under 5 years of age, compared to a pre-vaccine baseline \n(1998/99). In parallel, there was a 62% reduction in vaccine type IPD in individuals over 5 years of age. \nThis indirect or herd effect is due to a reduction in transmission of vaccine serotypes from immunised \nyoung children to the rest of the population and coincides with decreased nasopharyngeal carriage of \nvaccine serotypes.\n\nIn Quebec, Canada Prevenar was introduced at 2, 4 and 12 months of age with a single dose catch-up \nprogramme in children up to 5 years of age. In the first two years of the programme, with over 90% \ncoverage, the observed effectiveness against IPD caused by vaccine serotypes was 93% (95% CI 75-98) \nfor the 2 dose infant series and 100% (95% CI 91-100) for the completed schedule. \n\nPreliminary data from England and Wales reported less than 1 year following introduction of routine \nimmunisation at 2, 4 and 13 months with a single dose catch-up programme for children 13 to 23 months \nof age have suggested that effectiveness of this schedule might be lower against serotype 6B than against \nthe other serotypes in the vaccine.\n\nThe effectiveness of a two-dose primary series has not been established against pneumonia or acute otitis \nmedia.\n\nAdditional immunogenicity data\n\nThe immunogenicity of Prevenar has been investigated in an open-label, multicenter study in 49 infants \nwith sickle cell disease. Children were vaccinated with Prevenar (3 doses one month apart from the age of \n2 months) and 46 of these children also received a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at the \nage of 15-18 months. After primary immunisation, 95.6% of the subjects had antibody levels of at least \n0.35 \u00b5g/ml for all seven serotypes found in Prevenar. A significant increase was seen in the concentrations \nof antibodies against the seven serotypes after the polysaccharide vaccination, suggesting that \nimmunological memory was well established.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nA repeated dose intramuscular toxicity study (13 weeks, 5 injections, one every three weeks) of \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine in rabbits revealed no evidence of any significant local or systemic toxic \neffects.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20\n\nRepeated dose subcutaneous toxicity studies (13 weeks, 7 injections of the clinical dose, one every other \nweek, followed by a 4-week recovery period) of Prevenar in rats and monkeys revealed no evidence of \nany significant local or systemic toxic effects.\n\n6.

WHAT PREVENAR IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR\n\nPrevenar is a pneumococcal vaccine. Prevenar is given to children from 2 months to 5 years to help protect\nagainst diseases such as: meningitis, sepsis or bacteraemia (bacteria in blood stream), pneumonia and ear \ninfection caused by seven types of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nThe vaccine works by helping the body to make its own antibodies, which protect your child against \nthese diseases.\n\n2. BEFORE YOUR CHILD RECEIVES PREVENAR\n\nDo not use Prevenar:\n- if your child is allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substances, to any other ingredients or to \n\ndiphtheria toxoid.\n- if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). If this applies to your child, \n\nthen the vaccination will be postponed until your child is feeling better. A minor infection, such as a \ncold, should not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse first.\n\nTake special care with Prevenar:\n- if your child has any present or past medical problems after any dose of Prevenar.\n- if your child has any bleeding problems.\n\nPrevenar will only protect against ear infections caused by the types of Streptococcus pneumoniae for \nwhich the vaccine has been developed. It will not protect against other infectious agents that can cause \near infections.\n\nUsing other medicines/vaccines:\nPlease tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if your child is taking or has recently taken any other \nmedicines including medicines obtained without prescription or has recently received any other vaccine.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n49\n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Prevenar:\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per dose, i.e. essentially sodium-free\n\n3. HOW PREVENAR IS GIVEN\n\nThe doctor or nurse will inject the recommended dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine into your \nchild's arm or leg muscle.\nPrevenar can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines; in this case different injection sites \nshould be used.\n\nInfants aged 6 weeks to 6 months of age\n\nTypically, your child should receive an initial course of three injections followed by a booster dose\n\uf0b7 The first injection may be given from 2 months of age\n\uf0b7 Each injection will be given at least 1 month apart\n\uf0b7 A fourth injection (booster) will be given between 11 and 15 months of age\n\uf0b7 You will be told when your child should come back for the next injection\n\nAccording to official recommendations in your country, an alternative schedule may be used by your \nhealth-care provider. Please speak to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for more information.\n\nUnvaccinated infants and children over 7 months of age\n\nInfants aged 7 to- 11 months should receive two injections. Each injection will be given at least 1 month \napart. A third injection will be given in the second year of life. \nChildren aged 12 to 23 months should receive two injections. Each injection will be given at least 2 \nmonth apart. \nChildren aged 2 to 5 years should receive one injection.\n\nIt is important to follow the instructions from the doctor, pharmacist, or nurse so that your child completes \nthe course of injections.\n\nIf you forget to go back to the doctor or nurse at the scheduled time, ask the doctor or nurse for advice.\n\n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS\n\nLike all vaccines, Prevenar can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

Do not use if the \ncontent appears otherwise.\n\nPrevenar is for intramuscular use only. Do not administer intravenously.\nThis vaccine should not be given to infants or children with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder \nthat would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of \nadministration. \n\nInfants age 2 - 6 months: the primary infant series consists of three doses, each of 0.5 ml, the first dose \nusually given at 2 months of age and with an interval of at least 1 month between doses.\nA fourth dose is recommended in the second year of life.\n\nAlternatively, when Prevenar is given as part of a routine infant immunisation programme, a two-dose \nschedule may be considered. The first dose may be given from the age of 2 months with a second dose at \nleast 2 months later and a third (booster) dose at 11-15 months of age.\n\nInfants aged 7 - 11 months: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. \nA third dose is recommended in the second year of life. \nChildren aged 12 - 23 months: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 2 months between \ndoses.\nChildren aged 24 months - 5 years: one single dose.\n\nThe need for a booster dose after these immunisation schedules has not been established.\n\nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar should be postponed in subjects suffering from \nacute moderate or severe febrile illness.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily \navailable in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.\n\nPrevenar will not protect against other Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes than those included in the \nvaccine or other micro-organisms that cause invasive disease or otitis media.\n\nAlthough some antibody response to diphtheria toxoid may occur, immunisation with this vaccine does \nnot substitute for routine diphtheria immunisation.\n\nFor children from 2 years through 5 years of age, a single dose immunisation schedule was used. A higher \nrate of local reactions has been observed in children older than 24 months of age compared with infants.\n\nDifferent injectable vaccines should always be given at different injection sites.\n\nLimited data have demonstrated that Prevenar induces an acceptable immune response in infants with \nsickle cell disease with a safety profile similar to that observed in non-high-risk groups.  Safety and \nimmunogenicity data are not yet available for children in other specific high-risk groups for invasive \npneumococcal disease (e.g. children with another congenital or acquired splenic dysfunction, HIV-\ninfected, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome).  Vaccination in high-risk groups should be considered on an \nindividual basis.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n54\n\nChildren below 2 years old (including those at high-risk) should receive the appropriate-for-age Prevenar \nvaccination series.  The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of 23-valent \npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in children \uf0b3 24 months of age with conditions (such as sickle cell \ndisease, asplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness or who are immunocompromised) placing them at higher \nrisk for invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.  Whenever recommended, children at risk who \nare \u2265 24 months of age and already primed with Prevenar should receive 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine.  The interval between the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar) and the 23-\nvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should not be less than 8 weeks.  There are no data available \nto indicate whether the administration of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to unprimed \nchildren or to children primed with Prevenar might result in hyporesponsiveness to further doses of \nPrevenar.\nProphylactic antipyretic medication is recommended:\n-  for all children receiving Prevenar simultaneously with vaccines containing whole cell pertussis because \nof higher rate of febrile reactions\n-  for children with seizure disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures.\n\nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated whenever warranted or when the temperature rises above 39\u00b0C.\n\nChildren with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy, a \ngenetic defect, HIV infection, or other causes, may have reduced antibody response to active \nimmunisation.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Prevenar may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine from pneumococcal \ndisease.  Additionally, for vaccine serotypes, protection against otitis media is expected to be substantially \nlower than protection against invasive disease.  As otitis media is caused by many organisms other than \npneumococcal serotypes represented in the vaccine, protection against all otitis media is expected to be \nlow.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n55\n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER\n\nPrevenar suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe\nPneumococcal saccharide conjugated vaccine, adsorbed\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine.\n- Keep this leaflet.

Do not use if the \ncontent appears otherwise.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n60\n\nPrevenar is for intramuscular use only. Do not administer intravenously.\nThis vaccine should not be given to infants or children with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder \nthat would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of \nadministration.\n\nInfants aged 2 - 6 months: the primary infant series consists of three doses, each of 0.5 ml, the first dose \nusually given at 2 months of age and with an interval of at least 1 month between doses.\nA fourth dose is recommended in the second year of life.\n\nAlternatively, when Prevenar is given as part of a routine infant immunisation programme, a two-dose \nschedule may be considered. The first dose may be given from the age of 2 months with a second dose at \nleast 2 months later and a third (booster) dose at 11-15 months of age.\n\nInfants aged 7 - 11 months: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 1 month between doses. \nA third dose is recommended in the second year of life. \nChildren aged 12 - 23 months: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, with an interval of at least 2 months between \ndoses. \nChildren aged 24 months - 5 years: one single dose.\n\nThe need for a booster dose after these immunisation schedules has not been established. \n\nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar should be postponed in subjects suffering from \nacute moderate or severe febrile illness.\n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily \navailable in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.\n\nPrevenar will not protect against other Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes than those included in the \nvaccine or other micro-organisms that cause invasive disease or otitis media.\n\nAlthough some antibody response to diphtheria toxoid may occur, immunisation with this vaccine does \nnot substitute for routine diphtheria immunisation.\n\nFor children from 2 years through 5 years of age, a single dose immunisation schedule was used. A higher \nrate of local reactions has been observed in children older than 24 months of age compared with infants.\n\nDifferent injectable vaccines should always be given at different injection sites.\n\nLimited data have demonstrated that Prevenar induces an acceptable immune response in infants with \nsickle cell disease with a safety profile similar to that observed in non-high-risk groups.  Safety and \nimmunogenicity data are not yet available for children in other specific high-risk groups for invasive \npneumococcal disease (e.g. children with another congenital or acquired splenic dysfunction, HIV-\ninfected, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome). Vaccination in high-risk groups should be considered on an \nindividual basis. \n\nChildren below 2 years old (including those at high-risk) should receive the appropriate-for-age Prevenar \nvaccination series.  The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of 23-valent \npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in children \uf0b3 24 months of age with conditions (such as sickle cell \ndisease, asplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness or who are immunocompromised) placing them at higher \nrisk for invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.  Whenever recommended, children at risk who \nare \u2265 24 months of age and already primed with Prevenar should receive 23-valent pneumococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine.  The interval between the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar) and the 23-\nvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should not be less than 8 weeks.  There are no data available \nto indicate whether the administration of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to unprimed \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n61\n\nchildren or to children primed with Prevenar might result in hyporesponsiveness to further doses of \nPrevenar.\n\nProphylactic antipyretic medication is recommended:\n-  for all children receiving Prevenar simultaneously with vaccines containing whole cell pertussis because \nof higher rate of febrile reactions\n-  for children with seizure disorders or with a prior history of febrile seizures.\nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated whenever warranted or when the temperature rises above 39\u00b0C.\n\nChildren with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy, a \ngenetic defect, HIV infection, or other causes, may have reduced antibody response to active \nimmunisation.\n\nAs with any vaccine, Prevenar may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine from pneumococcal \ndisease. Additionally, for vaccine serotypes, protection against otitis media is expected to be substantially \nlower than protection against invasive disease. As otitis media is caused by many organisms other than \npneumococcal serotypes represented in the vaccine, protection against all otitis media is expected to be \nlow.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n62\n\nANNEX IV\n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE \nMARKETING AUTHORISATIONS\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n63\n\nScientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations\n\nDue to the long-standing post marketing experience, the well characterised safety profile and the large \n\nexposure of the product the PRAC recommended to amend the PSUR frequency to 10-yearly and to \n\namend Annex II accordingly to reflect the current QRD template sentence referring to the EURD list.\n\nTherefore, in view of available data the PRAC considered that changes to the conditions of the marketing \n\nauthorisation were warranted. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
