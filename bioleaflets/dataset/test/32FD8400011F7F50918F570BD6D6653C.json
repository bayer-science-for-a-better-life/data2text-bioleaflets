This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.  \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nBiktarvy 50 mg/200 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains bictegravir sodium equivalent to 50 mg of bictegravir, 200 mg of \nemtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate equivalent to 25 mg of tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nPurplish-brown, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablet debossed with \u201cGSI\u201d on one side and \u201c9883\u201d on \nthe other side of the tablet.  Each tablet is approximately 15 mm \u00d7 8 mm. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBiktarvy is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 \n(HIV-1) without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, \nemtricitabine or tenofovir (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nOne tablet to be taken once daily. \n \nMissed doses \nIf the patient misses a dose of Biktarvy within 18 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient \nshould take Biktarvy as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a patient misses a \ndose of Biktarvy by more than 18 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply \nresume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Biktarvy another tablet should be taken.  If a patient \nvomits more than 1 hour after taking Biktarvy they do not need to take another dose of Biktarvy until \nthe next regularly scheduled dose. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Biktarvy is required in patients aged \u2265 65 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Biktarvy is required in patients with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \n\u2265 30 mL/min. \n \nNo dose adjustment of Biktarvy is required in adult patients with end stage renal disease (estimated \ncreatinine clearance < 15 mL/minute) who are receiving chronic haemodialysis.  However, Biktarvy \nshould generally be avoided and only be used in these patients if the potential benefits are considered \nto outweigh the potential risks (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  On days of haemodialysis, administer the \ndaily dose of Biktarvy after completion of haemodialysis treatment. \n \nInitiation of Biktarvy should be avoided in patients with estimated creatinine clearance \u226515 mL/min \nand < 30 mL/min, or < 15 mL/min who are not receiving chronic haemodialysis, as the safety of \nBiktarvy has not been established in these populations (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Biktarvy is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.  Biktarvy has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), therefore Biktarvy is not recommended for use in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Biktarvy in children under the age of 18 years have not yet been \nestablished.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use \nBiktarvy can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \nThe film-coated tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration with rifampicin and St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. \n \nThere are limited safety and efficacy data for Biktarvy in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and \nhepatitis C virus (HCV).  \n \nBiktarvy contains tenofovir alafenamide, which is active against hepatitis B virus (HBV). \n \nDiscontinuation of Biktarvy therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated \nwith severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis.  Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue \nBiktarvy should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several \nmonths after stopping treatment. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nLiver disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Biktarvy in patients with significant underlying liver disorders have not \nbeen established. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include \ncytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis \njirovecii pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when \nnecessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients should be advised that Biktarvy or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure \nHIV infection and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of \nHIV infection.  Therefore patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians \nexperienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nNephrotoxicity \n \nA potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to \ndosing with tenofovir alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). \n \nPatients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis \n \nBiktarvy should generally be avoided but may be used in adults with end stage renal disease \n(estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits outweigh the \npotential risks (see section 4.2).  In a study of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination \nwith elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected adults \nwith end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis, efficacy was \nmaintained through 96 weeks but emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in patients with \nnormal renal function.  Efficacy was also maintained in the extension phase of the study in which 10 \npatients switched to Biktarvy for 48 weeks.  Although no additional adverse reactions were identified, \nthe implications of increased emtricitabine exposure remain uncertain (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n \nBiktarvy should not be co-administered simultaneously with magnesium/aluminium-containing \nantacids or iron supplements under fasted conditions.  Biktarvy should be administered at least 2 hours \nbefore, or with food 2 hours after antacids containing magnesium and/or aluminium.  Biktarvy should \nbe administered at least 2 hours before iron supplements, or taken together with food (see section 4.5). \n \nSome medicinal products are not recommended for co-administration with Biktarvy: atazanavir, \ncarbamazepine, ciclosporin (IV or oral use), oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, \nrifapentine, or sucralfate. \n \nBiktarvy should not be co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nBiktarvy should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil used for the treatment of \nHBV infection. \n \nBictegravir \n \nBictegravir is a substrate of CYP3A and UGT1A1.  Co-administration of bictegravir and medicinal \nproducts that potently induce both CYP3A and UGT1A1, such as rifampicin or St. John\u2019s wort, may \nsignificantly decrease plasma concentrations of bictegravir, which may result in a loss of therapeutic \neffect of Biktarvy and development of resistance, therefore co-administration is contraindicated (see \n\n\n\n6 \n\nsection 4.3).  Co-administration of bictegravir with medicinal products that potently inhibit both \nCYP3A and UGT1A1, such as atazanavir, may significantly increase plasma concentrations of \nbictegravir, therefore co-administration is not recommended.  \n \nBictegravir is both a P-gp and a BCRP substrate.  The clinical relevance of this feature is not \nestablished.  Therefore, caution is recommended when bictegravir is combined with medicinal \nproducts known to inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP (e.g. macrolides, ciclosporin, verapamil, dronedarone, \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir) (see also table below). \n \nBictegravir inhibits organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion \ntransporter 1 (MATE1) in vitro.  Co-administration of Biktarvy with the OCT2 and MATE1 substrate \nmetformin did not result in a clinically significant increase in metformin exposure.  Biktarvy may be \nco-administered with substrates of OCT2 and MATE1.  \n \nBictegravir is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP in vivo. \n \nEmtricitabine \n \nIn vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for \nCYP-mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.  \nCo-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular \nsecretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, and/or the co-administered medicinal product.  \nMedicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein \n(BCRP).  Co-administration of Biktarvy with medicinal products that strongly affect P-gp and BCRP \nactivity may lead to changes in tenofovir alafenamide absorption.  Medicinal products that induce \nP-gp activity (e.g. rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) are expected to decrease the absorption of \ntenofovir alafenamide, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide, which \nmay lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Biktarvy and development of resistance.  Co-administration of \nBiktarvy with other medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may increase the absorption and \nplasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo. \n \nOther interactions \n \nInteractions between Biktarvy or its individual component(s) and co-administered medicinal products \nare listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d and no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d; all No \nEffect Boundaries are 70%-143%).  \n \nTable 1: Interactions between

A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than \n1,000 exposed outcomes) indicate no malformative nor foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with \nemtricitabine. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of emtricitabine with respect to \nfertility parameters, pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development.  Studies of \nbictegravir and tenofovir alafenamide, administered separately, in animals have shown no evidence of \nharmful effects on fertility parameters, pregnancy, or foetal development (see section 5.3). \n \nBiktarvy should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \nthe foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether bictegravir or tenofovir alafenamide is excreted in human milk.  Emtricitabine \nis excreted in human milk.  In animal studies, bictegravir was detected in the plasma of nursing rat \npups likely due to the presence of bictegravir in milk, without effects on nursing pups.  In animal \nstudies it has been shown that tenofovir is excreted in milk.   \n \nThere is insufficient information on the effects of all the components of Biktarvy in newborns/infants, \ntherefore Biktarvy should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nIn order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV-infected women do not \nbreast-feed their infants under any circumstances. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Biktarvy on fertility are available.  Animal studies indicate no effects \nof bictegravir, emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide on mating or fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with the components of \nBiktarvy (see section 4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe assessment of adverse reactions is based on safety data from across all Phase 2 and 3 studies with \nBiktarvy and from post-marketing experience.  In clinical studies of treatment-na\u00efve patients receiving \nBiktarvy through 144 weeks, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache (5%), \ndiarrhoea (5%) and nausea (4%). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions in Table 2 are listed by system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are \ndefined as follows: common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions1 \n \nFrequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nUncommon: anaemia2 \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: depression, abnormal dreams \nUncommon: suicidal behaviour, anxiety, sleep disorders \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: headache, dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: diarrhoea, nausea \nUncommon: vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, flatulence \nHepatobiliary disorders \nUncommon: hyperbilirubinaemia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: angioedema3,4, rash, pruritus, urticaria4 \nRare: Stevens-Johnson syndrome5 \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon: arthralgia \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \n1 With the exception of angioedema, anaemia, urticaria and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (see footnotes 2-5), all adverse \n\nreactions were identified from Biktarvy clinical studies.  The frequencies were derived from Phase 3 Biktarvy clinical \nstudies in treatment-na\u00efve patients through 144 weeks (GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490). \n\n2 This adverse reaction was not observed in the clinical studies of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide-containing \nproducts but identified from clinical studies or post-marketing experience for emtricitabine when used with other \nantiretrovirals. \n\n3 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for emtricitabine-containing products. \n4 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. \n5 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for Biktarvy. The frequency has been calculated \n\nusing 3/X, where X represent the cumulative number of subjects exposed to Biktarvy in clinical trials (N=3963). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nChanges in serum creatinine \nBictegravir has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of \ncreatinine, however these changes are not considered to be clinically relevant since they do not reflect \na change in glomerular filtration rate.  Increases in serum creatinine occurred by Week 4 of treatment \nand remained stable through Week 144.  In Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490, median \n(Q1, Q3) serum creatinine increased by 0.11 (0.03, 0.19) mg/dL (9.7 [2.7, 16.8] \u00b5mol/L), \n0.11 (0.04, 0.19) mg/dL (9.7 [3.5, 16.8] \u00b5mol/L), and 0.12 (0.06, 0.21) mg/dL \n(10.6 [5.3, 18.6] \u03bcmol/L) from baseline to Week 144 in the Biktarvy, \nabacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, and dolutegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide groups, \nrespectively.  There were no discontinuations due to renal adverse events through Week 144 in \npatients administered Biktarvy in clinical studies. \n \nChanges in bilirubin \nIn Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490, total bilirubin increases were observed in 17% of \ntreatment-na\u00efve patients administered Biktarvy through Week 144.  Increases were primarily Grade 1 \n(12%) and Grade 2 (4%) (\u22651.0 to 2.5 x Upper Limit of Normal [ULN]), and were not associated with \nhepatic adverse reactions or other liver related laboratory abnormalities.  Five patients administered \nBiktarvy (1%) had grade 3 bilirubin increases that were not considered related to study drug.  There \nwere no discontinuations due to hepatic adverse events through Week 144 in Biktarvy clinical studies. \n \nOther special populations \n \nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B \nIn 16 HIV/HBV co-infected adults administered Biktarvy (8 HIV/HBV treatment-na\u00efve adults in \nStudy GS-US-380-1490; 8 HIV/HBV suppressed adults in Study GS-US-380-1878), the safety profile \nof Biktarvy was similar to that in patients with HIV-1 monoinfection (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly \nStudies GS-US-380-1844, GS-US-380-1878 and the dedicated Study GS-US-380-4449 in patients \n\u2265 65 years old (evaluation of 86 HIV-1 infected, virologically-suppressed subjects \u2265 65 years old) \nincluded 111 patients aged \u2265 65 years who received Biktarvy.  In these patients, no differences in the \nsafety profile of Biktarvy were observed.  \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe safety of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated in a single arm, open-label clinical \nstudy (GS-US-292-1825), in which 55 virologically-suppressed HIV-1 infected patients with end stage \nrenal disease (eGFRCG < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis received emtricitabine + tenofovir \nalafenamide in combination with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet for 96 \nweeks. In an extension phase of Study GS-US-292-1825, 10 patients switched to Biktarvy for 48 \nweeks. No additional adverse reactions were identified in patients with end stage renal disease on \nchronic haemodialysis in this study (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8).  Treatment \nof overdose with Biktarvy consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs \nas well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Biktarvy.  As bictegravir is highly bound to plasma \nproteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.  \nEmtricitabine can be removed by hemodialysis, which removes approximately 30% of the \nemtricitabine dose over a 3-hour dialysis period starting within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing.  \nTenofovir is efficiently removed by hemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately \n54%.  It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations, ATC code: J05AR20 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nBictegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that binds to the integrase active site and \nblocks the strand transfer step of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential \nfor the HIV replication cycle.  Bictegravir has activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2. \n \nEmtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and analogue of 2\u2019-deoxycytidine.  \nEmtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate.  Emtricitabine \ntriphosphate inhibits HIV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV reverse \ntranscriptase (RT), which results in DNA chain-termination.  Emtricitabine has activity against HIV-1, \nHIV-2 and HBV. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and phosphonamidate \nprodrug of tenofovir (2\u2019-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue).  Tenofovir alafenamide is \npermeable into cells and due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation through \nhydrolysis by cathepsin A, tenofovir alafenamide is more efficient than tenofovir disoproxil in loading \ntenofovir into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (including lymphocytes and other HIV \ntarget cells) and macrophages.  Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated to the \npharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV \nreplication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV RT, which results in DNA chain-\ntermination.  Tenofovir has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2 and HBV.   \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nThe antiviral activity of bictegravir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage cells, and CD4+ T-lymphocytes.  \nThe 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for bictegravir were in the range of < 0.05 to 6.6 nM.  \nThe protein-adjusted EC95 of bictegravir was 361 nM (0.162 \u00b5g/mL) for wild type HIV-1 virus.  \nBictegravir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 group (M, N, O), including \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n\nsubtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from < 0.05 to 1.71 nM), and activity against \nHIV-2 (EC50 = 1.1 nM). \n \nThe antiviral activity of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI CCR5 cell line, and PBMCs.  The EC50 values for emtricitabine \nwere in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 \u00b5M.  Emtricitabine displayed antiviral activity in cell culture \nagainst HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 0.075 \u00b5M) and \nshowed activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 1.5 \u00b5M). \n \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 \nsubtype B was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage cells, \nand CD4+ T-lymphocytes.  The EC50 values for tenofovir alafenamide were in the range of 2.0 to \n14.7 nM.  Tenofovir alafenamide displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against all HIV-1 groups \n(M, N, O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.10 to 12.0 nM) and \nactivity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.91 to 2.63 nM). \n \nResistance \n \nIn vitro \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to bictegravir have been selected in cell culture.  In one \nselection, amino acid substitutions M50I and R263K emerged and phenotypic susceptibility to \nbictegravir was reduced 1.3-, 2.2-, and 2.9-fold for M50I, R263K, and M50I + R263K, respectively.  \nIn a second selection, amino acid substitutions T66I and S153F emerged and phenotypic susceptibility \nto bictegravir was shifted 0.4-, 1.9-, and 0.5-fold for T66I, S153F, and T66I + S153F, respectively. \n \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine have been selected in cell culture and had \nM184V/I mutations in HIV-1 RT. \n \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide have been selected in cell culture \nand had the K65R mutation in HIV-1 RT; in addition, a K70E mutation in HIV-1 RT has been \ntransiently observed.  HIV-1 isolates with the K65R mutation have low level reduced susceptibility to \nabacavir, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and lamivudine.  In vitro drug resistance selection studies with \ntenofovir alafenamide have shown no development of high-level resistance after extended culture. \n \nIn treatment-na\u00efve (Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490) and virologically-suppressed \npatients (Studies GS-US-380-1844 and GS-US-380-1878), no patient receiving Biktarvy had HIV-1 \nwith treatment-emergent genotypic or phenotypic resistance to bictegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir \nalafenamide in the final resistance analysis population (n = 11) with HIV-1 RNA \u2265 200 copies/mL at \nthe time of confirmed virologic failure, at Week 48 or early study drug discontinuation (all studies) or \nat Week 96 or Week 144 (treatment na\u00efve studies only).  At the time of study entry, one treatment-\nna\u00efve patient had pre-existing INSTI resistance-associated mutations Q148H + G140S and had HIV-1 \nRNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 4 through Week 144. In addition, 6 patients had the pre-existing INSTI \nresistance-associated mutation T97A; all had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 144 or the last \nvisit. \n \nCross-resistance  \nThe susceptibility of bictegravir was tested against 64 INSTI-resistant clinical isolates (20 with single \nsubstitutions and 44 with 2 or more substitutions).  Of these, all single and double mutant isolates \nlacking Q148H/K/R and 10 of 24 isolates with Q148H/K/R with additional INSTI resistance \nassociated substitutions had \u2264 2.5-fold reduced susceptibility to bictegravir; > 2.5-fold reduced \nsusceptibility to bictegravir was found for 14 of the 24 isolates that contained G140A/C/S and \nQ148H/R/K substitutions in integrase.  Of those, 9 of the 14 isolates had additional mutations at \nL74M, T97A, or E138A/K.  In a separate study, site-directed mutants with G118R and T97A+G118R \nhad 3.4- and 2.8-fold reduced susceptibility to bictegravir, respectively.  The relevance of these \nin vitro cross-resistance data remains to be established in clinical practice. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nBictegravir demonstrated equivalent antiviral activity against 5 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitor (NNRTI)-resistant, 3 NRTI-resistant, and 4 protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant HIV-1 mutant \nclones compared with the wild-type strain. \n \nEmtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I substitution were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but \nretained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine.   \n \nThe K65R and K70E mutations result in reduced susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, \nemtricitabine, and tenofovir, but retain sensitivity to zidovudine.  Multinucleoside resistant HIV-1 \nwith a T69S double insertion mutation or with a Q151M mutation complex including K65R showed \nreduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide.   \n \nClinical data \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Biktarvy in HIV-1 infected, treatment-na\u00efve adults are based on 48-week \nand 144-week data from two randomised, double-blind, active-controlled studies, GS-US-380-1489 \n(n = 629) and GS-US-380-1490 (n = 645). \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Biktarvy in virologically-suppressed HIV-1 infected adults are based on \n48-week data from a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study, GS-US-380-1844 (n = 563); \nand a randomised, open-label, active-controlled study, GS-US-380-1878 (n = 577). \n \nHIV-1 infected, treatment-na\u00efve patients \nIn Study GS-US-380-1489, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either \nbictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) (n = 314) or \nabacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (600/50/300 mg) (n = 315) once daily.  In Study GS-US-380-1490, \npatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either B/F/TAF (n = 320) or \ndolutegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (50+200/25 mg) (n = 325) once daily. \n \nIn Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490, the mean age was 35 years (range 18-77), 89% \nwere male, 58% were White, 33% were Black, and 3% were Asian.  Twenty-four percent of patients \nidentified as Hispanic/Latino.  The prevalence of different subtypes was comparable across all three \ntreatment groups, with subtype B predominant in both groups; 11% were non-B subtypes.

Patients must have been stably suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) on \ntheir baseline regimen for at least 3 months prior to study entry.  Patients were randomised in a 1:1 \nratio to either switch to B/F/TAF at baseline (n = 282), or stay on their baseline antiretroviral regimen \n(n = 281).  Patients had a mean age of 45 years (range 20-71), 89% were male, 73% were White, and \n22% were Black.  Seventeen percent of patients identified as Hispanic/Latino.  The prevalence of \ndifferent HIV-1 subtypes was comparable between treatment groups, with subtype B predominant in \nboth groups; 5% were non-B subtypes.

In \nStudy GS-US-380-1490, 8 patients with HIV/HBV co-infection at baseline were randomised to \nreceive B/F/TAF. At Week 48, 7 patients were HBV suppressed (HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL) and had \nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL.  One patient had missing HBV DNA data at Week 48.  At Week 144, 5 \npatients were HBV suppressed and had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL.  Three patients had missing \nHBV DNA data at Week 144 (1 lost to follow-up from Week 48, 1 lost to follow-up after Week 72, \nand 1 lost to follow-up after Week 120). \n \nIn Study GS-US-380-1878, at Week 48, 100% (8/8) of the patients co-infected with HIV/HBV at \nbaseline in the B/F/TAF arm maintained HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL (missing = excluded analysis) and \nHIV RNA < 50 copies/mL. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nBiktarvy in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of human \nHIV-1 infection (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nBictegravir is absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma concentrations occurring at \n2.0-4.0 hours after administration of B/F/TAF.  Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of \nB/F/TAF with either a moderate fat (~600 kcal, 27% fat) or high fat meal (~800 kcal, 50% fat) \nresulted in an increase in bictegravir AUC (24%).  This modest change is not considered clinically \nmeaningful and B/F/TAF can be administered with or without food. \n \nFollowing oral administration of B/F/TAF with or without food in HIV-1 infected adults, the multiple \ndose mean (CV%) pharmacokinetic parameters of bictegravir were Cmax = 6.15 \u00b5g/mL (22.9%), \nAUCtau = 102 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL (26.9%), and Ctrough = 2.61 \u00b5g/mL (35.2%). \n \nEmtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma \nconcentrations occurring at 1.5-2.0 hours after administration of B/F/TAF.  The mean absolute \nbioavailability of emtricitabine from 200 mg hard capsules was 93%.  Emtricitabine systemic exposure \nwas unaffected when emtricitabine was administered with food and B/F/TAF can be administered with \nor without food. \n \nFollowing oral administration of B/F/TAF with or without food in HIV-1 infected adults, the multiple \ndose mean (CV%) pharmacokinetic parameters of emtricitabine were Cmax = 2.13 \u00b5g/mL (34.7%), \nAUCtau = 12.3 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL (29.2%), and Ctrough = 0.096 \u00b5g/mL (37.4%). \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma \nconcentrations occurring at 0.5-2.0 hours after administration of B/F/TAF.  Relative to fasting \nconditions, the administration of tenofovir alafenamide with a moderate fat meal (~600 kcal, 27% fat) \nand a high fat meal (~800 kcal, 50% fat) resulted in an increase in AUClast by 48% and 63%, \n\n\n\n21 \n\nrespectively.  These modest changes are not considered clinically meaningful and B/F/TAF can be \nadministered with or without food.  \n \nFollowing oral administration of B/F/TAF with or without food in HIV-1 infected adults, the multiple \ndose mean (CV%) pharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir alafenamide were Cmax = 0.121 \u00b5g/mL \n(15.4%), and AUCtau = 0.142 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL (17.3%). \n \nDistribution \n \nIn vitro binding of bictegravir to human plasma proteins was > 99% (free fraction ~0.25%).  The \nin vitro human blood to plasma bictegravir concentration ratio was 0.64. \n \nIn vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of \nconcentration over the range of 0.02 to 200 \u00b5g/mL.  At peak plasma concentration, the mean plasma to \nblood drug concentration ratio was ~1.0 and the mean semen to plasma drug concentration ratio was \n~4.0. \n \nIn vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is < 0.7% and is independent of concentration \nover the range of 0.01-25 \u00b5g/mL.  Ex vivo binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma proteins \nin samples collected during clinical studies was approximately 80%.   \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMetabolism is the major clearance pathway for bictegravir in humans.  In vitro phenotyping studies \nshowed that bictegravir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A and UGT1A1.  Following a single dose \noral administration of [14C]-bictegravir, ~60% of the dose from faeces included unchanged parent, \ndesfluoro-hydroxy-BIC-cysteine-conjugate, and other minor oxidative metabolites.  Thirty-five \npercent of the dose was recovered from urine and consisted primarily of the glucuronide of bictegravir \nand other minor oxidative metabolites and their phase II conjugates.  Renal clearance of the unchanged \nparent was minimal. \n \nFollowing administration of [14C]-emtricitabine, complete recovery of the emtricitabine dose was \nachieved in urine (~86%) and faeces (~14%).  Thirteen percent of the dose was recovered in the urine \nas three putative metabolites.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol \nmoiety to form the 3\u2019-sulfoxide diastereomers (~9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to \nform 2\u2019-O-glucuronide (~4% of dose).  No other metabolites were identifiable. \n \nMetabolism is a major elimination pathway for tenofovir alafenamide in humans, accounting for \n> 80% of an oral dose.  In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide is metabolised to \ntenofovir (major metabolite) by cathepsin A in PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV target \ncells) and macrophages; and by carboxylesterase-1 in hepatocytes.  In vivo, tenofovir alafenamide is \nhydrolysed within cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to the active \nmetabolite, tenofovir diphosphate.  In human clinical studies, a 25 mg oral dose of tenofovir \nalafenamide resulted in tenofovir diphosphate concentrations > 4-fold higher in PBMCs and > 90% \nlower concentrations of tenofovir in plasma as compared to a 245 mg oral dose of tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nElimination \n \nBictegravir is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism.  Renal excretion of intact bictegravir is a \nminor pathway (~1% of dose).  The plasma bictegravir half-life was 17.3 hours.  \n \nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys by both glomerular filtration and active tubular \nsecretion.  The plasma emtricitabine half-life was approximately 10 hours. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is eliminated following metabolism to tenofovir.  Tenofovir alafenamide and \ntenofovir have a median plasma half-life of 0.51 and 32.37 hours, respectively.  Tenofovir is \n\n\n\n22 \n\neliminated by the kidneys by both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.  Renal excretion \nof intact tenofovir alafenamide is a minor pathway with less than 1% of the dose eliminated in urine.   \n \nLinearity \n \nThe multiple dose pharmacokinetics of bictegravir are dose proportional over the dose range of 25 to \n100 mg.  The multiple dose pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine are dose proportional over the dose \nrange of 25 to 200 mg.  Tenofovir alafenamide exposures are dose proportional over the dose range of \n8 mg to 125 mg. \n \nOther special populations \n \nRenal impairment: \nSevere Renal Impairment (estimated creatinine clearance \u2265 15 and < 30 mL/minute) \nNo clinically relevant differences in bictegravir, tenofovir alafenamide, or tenofovir pharmacokinetics \nwere observed between healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated \nCrCl \u2265 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min) in Phase 1 Studies.  In a separate Phase 1 study of emtricitabine \nalone, mean systemic emtricitabine exposure was higher in patients with severe renal impairment \n(CrCl < 30 mL/min) (33.7 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL) than in subjects with normal renal function (11.8 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL).  The \nsafety of Biktarvy has not been established in subjects with estimated creatinine \nclearance \u2265 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min. \n \nEnd Stage Renal Disease (estimated creatinine clearance < 15 mL/minute) \nExposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir in 12 patients with end stage renal disease (estimated \nCrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis who received emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in \ncombination with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed dose combination tablet in Study GS-US-292-\n1825 were significantly higher than in patients with normal renal function.  No clinically relevant \ndifferences in tenofovir alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in patients with end stage renal \ndisease on chronic haemodialysis as compared to those with normal renal function.  In the extension \nphase of Study GS-US-292-1825, lower bictegravir Ctrough was observed in patients with end stage \nrenal disease who received Biktarvy compared to patients with normal renal function, but this \ndifference was not considered clinically relevant.  No additional adverse reactions were identified in \npatients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis in this study (see section 4.8). \n \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data on bictegravir, emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide in patients \nwith end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) not on chronic haemodialysis.  The safety \nof Biktarvy has not been established in these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nClinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of bictegravir were not observed in subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment.  The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in \nsubjects with hepatic impairment; however, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolised by liver \nenzymes, so the impact of liver impairment should be limited.  Clinically relevant changes in the \npharmacokinetics of tenofovir alafenamide or its metabolite tenofovir were not observed in patients \nwith mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. \n \nAge, gender and race \nPharmacokinetics of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir have not been fully evaluated in the \nelderly (\u2265 65 years of age).  Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult studies \ndid not identify any clinically relevant differences due to age, gender or race on the exposures of \nbictegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nBictegravir was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. \n\nBictegravir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse study (at doses of up to \n100 mg/kg/day in males and 300 mg/kg/day in females, which resulted in exposures of approximately \n\n\n\n23 \n\n15 and 23 times, in males and females, respectively, the exposure in humans at the recommended \nhuman dose) nor in a 2-year rat study (at doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day, which resulted in exposures of \napproximately 31 times the exposure in humans).  \n \nStudies of bictegravir in monkeys revealed the liver as the primary target organ of toxicity.  \nHepatobiliary toxicity was described in a 39-week study at a dosage of 1,000 mg/kg/day, which \nresulted in exposures of approximately 16 times the exposure in humans at the recommended human \ndose, and was partially reversible after a 4-week recovery period.  \n \nStudies in animals with bictegravir have shown no evidence of teratogenicity or an effect on \nreproductive function.  In offspring from rat and rabbit dams treated with bictegravir during \npregnancy, there were no toxicologically significant effects on developmental endpoints. \n \nNon-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies \nof safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction and development.  Emtricitabine has demonstrated low carcinogenic potential in mice \nand rats. \n \nNon-clinical studies of tenofovir alafenamide in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary \ntarget organs of toxicity.  Bone toxicity was observed as reduced bone mineral density in rats and dogs \nat tenofovir exposures at least 43 times greater than those expected after administration of B/F/TAF.  \nA minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and \ntenofovir exposures of approximately 14 and 43 times greater, respectively, than those expected after \nadministration of B/F/TAF. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. \n \nBecause there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after the administration of tenofovir \nalafenamide compared to tenofovir disoproxil, carcinogenicity studies and a rat peri-postnatal study \nwere conducted only with tenofovir disoproxil.  No special hazard for humans was revealed in \nconventional studies of carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development.  \nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or \nfoetal parameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a \nperi-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses. \n \n \n6.

Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Biktarvy you may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age.  The use of Biktarvy \nin children and adolescents under 18 years of age has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Biktarvy \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  Biktarvy may interact with other medicines.  As a result, the amounts of Biktarvy or other \nmedicines in your blood may change.

In children whose mothers took \nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection \nagainst HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Biktarvy.  This is because some of the active substances \nin this medicine pass into human breast milk.  It is also recommended that you do not breast-feed to \navoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk.

Then take the next dose as usual. \n\u2022 If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Biktarvy, then do not take the \n\nmissed dose.

Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPossible side effects: tell a doctor immediately \n \n\u2022 Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n\n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak \nimmune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon \nafter HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in \nthe body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present \nwith no obvious symptoms. \n\n \n\u2022 Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur \n\nafter you start taking medicines for HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many \nmonths after the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms \nsuch as: \n- muscle weakness \n- weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body \n- palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity \n \n\n\uf0e0 If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 depression \n\u2022 abnormal dreams \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\u2022 tiredness (fatigue) \n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 anaemia \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 stomach pain \n\u2022 problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) \n\u2022 wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) \n\u2022 itching (pruritus) \n\u2022 rash \n\u2022 hives (urticaria) \n\u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \n\u2022 suicidal behaviour \n\u2022 anxiety \n\u2022 sleep disorders \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nRare side effects  \n(may affect up to 1 in 1000 people) \n\u2022 Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a serious life-threatening condition which usually starts \n\nwith flu- like symptoms. A few days later other symptoms appear including: \n- Painful red or purple skin that looks burned and peels off \n- Blisters on your skin, mouth, nose, and genitals \n- Red, painful, watery eyes \n\n\uf0e0 If you have any of these symptoms, stop your medicine immediately and tell your doctor \nstraight away. \n\nBlood tests may also show: \n\u2022 higher levels of substances called bilirubin and/or serum creatinine in the blood \n \n\uf0e0 If any of the side effects get serious, tell your doctor. \n \nOther effects that may be seen during HIV treatment \n \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \n\u2022 Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Biktarvy \n\nmay develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood \nsupply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, \ndrinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of \nthe many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n- joint stiffness \n- joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n- difficulty with movement \n\n\uf0e0 If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5.

tablet as soon as possible. then take the next dose as usual. if you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take biktarvy, then do not take the missed dose. wait and take the next dose at your usual time. if you vomit less than 1 hour after taking biktarvy, take another tablet. if you vomit more than 1 hour after taking biktarvy you do not need to take another tablet until your next regularly scheduled tablet. do not stop taking biktarvy do not stop taking biktarvy without talking to your doctor. stopping biktarvy can seriously affect how future treatment works. if biktarvy is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before you restart taking biktarvy tablets. when your supply of biktarvy starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. this is very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. the disease may then become harder to treat. if you have both hiv infection and hepatitis b, it is especially important not to stop your biktarvy treatment without talking to your doctor first. you may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment. in some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis b infection. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.",

although not everybody gets them. possible side effects: tell a doctor immediately any signs of inflammation or infection. in some patients with advanced hiv infection (aids) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after hiv treatment is started. it is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur after you start taking medicines for hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as: - muscle weakness - weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body - palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity if you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor immediately. common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) depression abnormal dreams headache dizziness diarrhoea feeling sick (nausea) tiredness (fatigue) uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) anaemia vomiting stomach pain problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals (dyspepsia) wind (flatulence) swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) itching (pruritus) rash hives (urticaria) joint pain (arthralgia) suicidal behaviour anxiety sleep disorders 37 rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people) stevens-johnson syndrome (sjs) is a serious life-threatening condition which usually starts with flu- like symptoms. a few days later other symptoms appear including: - painful red or purple skin that looks burned and peels off - blisters on your skin, mouth, nose, and genitals - red, painful, watery eyes if you have any of these symptoms, stop your medicine immediately and tell your doctor straight away. blood tests may also show: higher levels of substances called bilirubin and/or serum creatinine in the blood if any of the side effects get serious, tell your doctor. other effects that may be seen during hiv treatment the frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). bone problems. some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as biktarvy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are: - joint stiffness - joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) - difficulty with movement if you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. during hiv therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help
