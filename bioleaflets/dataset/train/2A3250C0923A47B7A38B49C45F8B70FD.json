This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nELZONRIS 1 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 mL of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 1 mg tagraxofusp. Each vial contains 1 mg of \ntagraxofusp. \n \nTagraxofusp is a diphtheria toxin-interleukin-3 (IL-3) fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA \ntechnology in Escherichia coli.  \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach vial contains 50 mg of sorbitol (E420). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nClear, colourless liquid. A few white to translucent particles may be present. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nELZONRIS is indicated as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with blastic \nplasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posologyand method of administration \n \nELZONRIS should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \nanti-cancer agents. Appropriate resuscitation equipment should be available. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 12 mcg/kg tagraxofusp administered as an intravenous infusion over \n15 minutes, once daily, on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. The dosing period may be extended for dose \ndelays up to day 10 of the cycle. Treatment should be continued until disease progression or \nunacceptable toxicity (see section 4.4). \n \nFirst treatment cycle \nThe first cycle of ELZONRIS should be administered in the in-patient setting. Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity or capillary leak syndrome (see section 4.4) \nuntil at least 24 hours after the last infusion. \n \nSubsequent treatment cycles \n\n\n\n3 \n\nELZONRIS can be administered in the in-patient setting or in a suitable out-patient ambulatory care \nsetting that is equipped for intensive monitoring of patients with haematopoietic malignancies \nundergoing treatment. \n \nPre-medication \nPatients should be pre-medicated with a H1-histamine antagonist (e.g. diphenhydramine \nhydrochloride), a H2-histamine antagonist (e.g. ranitidine), a corticosteroid (e.g. 50 mg intravenous \nmethylprednisolone or equivalent) and paracetamol approximately 60 minutes prior to the start of \ninfusion (see section 4.4). \n \nDose adjustments \n \nVital signs should be monitored and albumin, transaminases, and creatinine checked prior to preparing \neach dose of ELZONRIS. See Table 1 for recommended dose modifications and Table 2 for capillary \nleak syndrome (CLS) management guidelines. \n \nVital signs should be monitored frequently during dosing. \n \nTable 1: Recommended ELZONRIS dosing regimen modifications \n \n\nParameter Severity criteria Dose modification \n\nSerum albumin  \nSerum albumin < 3.5 g/dL or reduced \n\u2265 0.5 g/dL from value measured prior to \ninitiation of the current cycle \n\nSee CLS Management Guidelines (Table 2) \n\nBody weight  Body weight increase \u2265 1.5 kg over pre-\ntreatment weight on prior treatment day See CLS Management Guidelines (Table 2) \n\nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) or alanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT)  \n\nALT or AST increase > 5 times the \nupper limit of normal  \n\nWithhold treatment until transaminase \nelevations are \u2264 2.5 times the upper limit of \nnormal. \n\nSerum creatinine  \nSerum creatinine > 1.8 mg/dL \n(159 micromol/L) or creatinine \nclearance < 60 mL/minute \n\nWithhold treatment until serum creatinine \nresolves to \u2264 1.8 mg/dL (159 micromol/L) or \ncreatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/minute. \n\nSystolic blood \npressure \n\nSystolic blood pressure \u2265 160 mmHg or \n\u2264 80 mmHg \n\nWithhold treatment until systolic blood \npressure is < 160 mmHg or > 80 mmHg. \n\nHeart rate  Heart rate \u2265 130 bpm or \u2264 40 bpm Withhold treatment until heart rate is \n< 130 bpm or > 40 bpm. \n\nBody temperature  Body temperature \u2265 38 \u00b0C Withhold treatment until body temperature is \n< 38 \u00b0C. \n\nHypersensitivity \nreactions Mild or moderate \n\nWithhold treatment until resolution of any \nmild or moderate hypersensitivity reaction. \nResume ELZONRIS at the same infusion \nrate. \n\n \nTable 2: CLS management guidelines \n\nTime of \nPresentation \n\nCLS \nSign/Symptom \n\nRecommended \nAction \n\nELZONRIS \nDosing \n\nManagement \nPrior to first dose of \nELZONRIS \nin cycle 1  \n\nSerum albumin < 3.2 g/dL  Administer ELZONRIS when serum albumin \u2265 3.2 g/dL \n\nDuring ELZONRIS \ndosing Serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL  \n\nAdminister 25 g intravenous albumin \nevery 12 hours (or more frequently as \npractical) until serum albumin is \n\u2265 3.5 g/dL AND not reduced by \n\nHold dosing \nuntil the \nrelevant CLS \nsign/symptom \n\n\n\n4 \n\n1 If ELZONRIS dose is held: \n- ELZONRIS administration may resume in the same cycle if all CLS signs/symptoms have resolved and \n\nthe patient did not require measures to treat haemodynamic instability.  \n- Administration should be held for the remainder of the cycle if CLS signs/symptoms have not resolved \n\nor the patient required measures to treat haemodynamic instability (e.g., required administration of \nintravenous fluids and/or vasopressors to treat hypotension) (even if resolved). \n\n- Administration may only resume in the next cycle if all CLS signs/symptoms have resolved, and the \npatient is haemodynamically stable.  \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nNo data are available for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo data are available for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n  \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients over 65 years of age (see section 5.2).  Generally, safety \nwas similar between elderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) and patients less than 65 years of age treated \nwith ELZONRIS. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of ELZONRIS in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been \nestablished (see section 5.1).  \nNo data are available. \n\nSerum albumin reduced by \n\u2265 0.5 g/dL from the \nalbumin value measured \nprior to ELZONRIS dosing \ninitiation of the current \ncycle \n\n\u2265 0.5 g/dL from the value measured \nprior to dosing initiation of the current \ncycle \n\nhas resolved 1 \n \n\nA pre-dose body weight \nthat is increased by \u2265 1.5 kg \nover the previous day\u2019s \npre-dose weight \n\nAdminister 25 g intravenous albumin \n(every 12 hours or more frequently as \npractical), and manage fluid status as \nindicated clinically (e.g., generally \nwith intravenous fluids and \nvasopressors if hypotensive and with \ndiuretics if normotensive or \nhypertensive), until body weight \nincrease has resolved (i.e. the increase \nis no longer \u2265 1.5 kg greater than the \nprevious day\u2019s pre-dose weight). \n\nOedema, fluid overload \nand/or hypotension \n\nAdminister 25 g intravenous albumin \n(every 12 hours, or more frequently as \npractical) until serum albumin is \n\u2265 3.5 g/dL. \n \nAdminister 1 mg/kg of \nmethylprednisolone (or an equivalent) \nper day, until resolution of CLS \nsign/symptom or as indicated \nclinically. \n \nAggressive management of fluid status \nand hypotension if present, which \ncould include intravenous fluids and/or \ndiuretics or other blood pressure \nmanagement, until resolution of CLS \nsign/symptom or as clinically \nindicated.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nELZONRIS is for intravenous use. \n \nThe prepared dose of diluted ELZONRIS should be administered via an infusion syringe pump over \n15 minutes. The total infusion time should be controlled using an infusion syringe pump to deliver the \nentire dose and the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection within 15 minutes. \n \nELZONRIS must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. It should be administered \nthrough a dedicated intravenous line and it must not be mixed with other medicinal products (see \nsection 6.2). \n \nPrior to infusion, venous access should be established and maintained with sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. \n \nFor instructions on preparation and administration of the medicinal product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \nCapillary leak syndrome (CLS), including life-threatening and fatal cases have been reported with \nmost events occuring during the first five days of the first cycle of treatment. The most frequent signs \nand symptoms of CLS included weight increased, hypoalbuminemia and hypotension. The incidence \nof weight increased, hypoalbuminemia, hypotension, and blood alkaline phosphatase increased are all \nhigher among patients who experienced CLS compared to patients that did not experience CLS. Renal \nfailure and acute kidney injury have been reported in two patients with BPDCN and in one patient \nwith AML secondary to CLS (see section 4.8). \n \nBefore initiating therapy, ensure that the patient has adequate cardiac function and serum albumin \n\u2265 3.2 g/dL. During treatment, regularly monitor serum albumin levels prior to the initiation of each \ndose, or more often as clinically indicated. Additionally, assess patients for other signs/symptoms of \nCLS including weight gain, new onset or worsening oedema, including pulmonary oedema, and \nhypotension including haemodynamic instability (see Table 2).  \n \nPatients should be made aware of identifying CLS symptoms and when to seek immediate medical \nattention. Intravenous albumin supplementation and dosing interruptions may be required (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nHypersensitivity reactions  \nSevere hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with ELZONRIS. Commonly reported reactions \ninclude rash (generalised / maculo-papular); wheezing; pruritus; angioedema; swelling face; and \nflushing (see section 4.8). Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions during treatment. Depending \non the severity and the required interventions, temporarily withhold treatment and resume after \nsymptoms have resolved (see section 4.2). \n \nHaematological abnormalities  \nThrombocytopenia and neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with ELZONRIS \nmonotherapy (see section 4.8). The majority of events were reported in cycle 1 and cycle 2 of \n\n\n\n6 \n\ntreatment, were not dose-limiting and did not recur in subsequent cycles. Patients should be routinely \nmonitored and treated as clinically indicated. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome \nELZONRIS can cause tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), which may be fatal as a result of its rapid \nanti-tumour activity (see section 4.8).   \n \nIdentify TLS based on clinical presentation and symptoms, including acute renal failure, \nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperuricaemia, or hyperphosphataemia from tumour lysis.  Patients \nconsidered at high risk for TLS due to high tumour burden should be managed as clinically indicated, \nincluding correction of electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function and fluid balance, and \nadministration of supportive care.   \n \nHepatotoxicity \nTreatment with ELZONRIS has been associated with elevations in liver enzymes (see section 4.8). \nAcute hepatic failure and liver encephalopathy has been reported in a patient treated with ELZONRIS \nat a higher dose (16 mcg/kg). During treatment, regularly monitor ALT and AST levels prior to the \ninitiation of each dose. Temporarily withhold treatment if transaminases rise to greater than 5 times \nthe upper limit of normal and resume treatment when transaminase elevations are \u2264 2.5 times the \nupper limit of normal (see section 4.2).  \n \nChoroid plexus lesions  \nChoroid plexitis was identified during non-clinical studies (see section 5.3). While not observed in \nclinical studies, if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) damage \noccur, full neurological examination is advised. \n \nCNS-involved BPDCN \nThe passage of tagraxofusp through the blood brain barrier is unknown. Other treatment alternatives \nshould be considered if CNS disease is present. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \nIn women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test should be obtained within 7 days prior \nto initiation of therapy. Effective contraception should be used before the first dose is administered \nand for at least one week after the last dose. \n \nHereditary fructose intolerence \nPatients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicinal product unless \nstrictly necessary.  \n \nA detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given \nthis medicinal product. \n \nSodium sensitivity \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \nIn women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test should be obtained within 7 days prior \nto initiation of therapy. Effective contraception should be used before the first dose is administered \nand for at least one week after the last dose. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPregnancy  \nThere are no data from the use of ELZONRIS in pregnant women.  \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with tagraxofusp (see section 5.3).  \n \nELZONRIS should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with tagraxofusp. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether tagraxofusp/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nA risk to breast-feeding newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with ELZONRIS and for at least one week \nafter the last dose. \n \nFertility \nNo fertility studies have been conducted with tagraxofusp (see section 5.3). There are no data on the \neffect of tagraxofusp on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nELZONRIS has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most serious adverse reaction that may occur during ELZONRIS treatment is CLS (see sections \n4.2 and 4.4) which was reported in 18% of patients with a median time to onset of CLS of 6 days. \n \nAdverse reactions occurring in \u2265 20% of patients treated with ELZONRIS were hypoalbuminemia, \nincreased transaminases, thrombocytopenia, nausea, fatigue and pyrexia.  \n \nAdverse reactions grade 3 and above according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \nevents (CTCAE) and occurring in > 5% of patients were increased transaminases, thrombocytopenia \nand anaemia. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe adverse reaction frequency is listed by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) at the preferred term \nlevel. Frequencies of occurrence of adverse reactions are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (\u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100).  \n \nThe adverse reactions described in this section were identified in clinical studies of patients with \nhaematologic malignancies (N=176), including 89 patients with BPDCN. In these studies, ELZONRIS \nwas administered as monotherapy at doses of 7 mcg/kg (12/176, 7%), 9 mcg/kg (9/176, 5%) and \n12 mcg/kg (155/176, 88%). Incidence and severity of adverse reaction in patients with BPDCN were \nsimilar to those of the entire studied population. \n \nTable 3:  Tabulated list of adverse reactions by MedDRA System Organ

\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \nCapillary leak syndrome was reported in 18% (32/176), with 12% (21/176) Grade 2, 3% (6/176) \nGrade 3, 1% (2/176) Grade 4, and fatal in 1.7% (3/176). Of the 25 patients that resumed treatment \nafter experiencing an event of CLS, only 1 patient experienced a recurrence of CLS. The median time \nto onset of CLS was short (6 days), with all but 2 patients experiencing the first onset of CLS in \ncycle 1. No patient experienced the first onset of CLS after cycle 2. The overall incidence of CLS was \nsimilar in patients with BPDCN (20%, 18/89), including 12% (11/89) Grade 2, 2% Grade 3 (2/89), 2% \nGrade 4 (2/89) and 3 fatal cases (3%).  Patients are required to have adequate cardiac function prior to \nadministration of ELZONRIS (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).   \n \nHepatotoxicity \nALT and AST elevations were reported as adverse reactions in 47% (83/176) and 46% (81/176) of \npatients treated with ELZONRIS monotherapy, respectively. \u2265 Grade 3 ALT and AST increased were \nreported in 23% (40/176) and 23% (40/176), respectively. Elevated liver enzymes occurred in the \nmajority of patients in cycle 1 and were reversible following dose interruptions (see section 4.4). \nSimilar onset time and incidence were observed in patients with BPDCN, with 51% (45/89) of patients \nexperiencing adverse events of ALT and AST elevations, with 23% (40/89) being \u2265 Grade 3. Two \npatients with BPDCN met the laboratory criteria for Hy\u2019s Law; in both cases the laboratory \nabnormalities were noted during Cycle 1. \n \nHaematological abnormalities \nThrombocytopenia was reported in 30% (53/176) of patients treated with ELZONRIS monotherapy \nand in 35% (31/89) of patients with BPDCN. Thrombocytopenia Grade \u2265 3 was reported in 23% \n(40/176) of patients treated with ELZONRIS monotherapy and in 26% (23/89) of patients with \nBPDCN. The majority of thrombocytopenia events were reported in cycle 1 and cycle 2 of treatment. \nNeutropenia was reported in 9% (15/176) of patients treated with ELZONRIS monotherapy and in 11% \n(10/89) of patients with BPDCN, with events \u2265 Grade 3-reported in 6% (11/176) and 8% (7/89), \nrespectively. \n \nHypersensitivity  \nReactions representative of hypersensitivity were reported in 19% (33/176) of patients treated with \nELZONRIS monotherapy and in 17% (15/89) of patients with BPDCN, with events \u2265 Grade 3 \nreported in 3% (6/176) and 4% (4/89), respectively (see section 4.4).  \n \nImmunogenicity \nImmune response was evaluated by assessment of serum binding reactivity against tagraxofusp (anti-\ndrug antibodies; ADA) and neutralising antibodies by inhibition of functional activity. Immune \nresponse was assessed using two immunoassays. The first assay detected reactivity directed against \ntagraxofusp (ADA), and the second assay detected reactivity against the interleukin-3 (IL-3) portion of \ntagraxofusp. Two cell-based assays were used to investigate the presence of neutralising antibodies by \ninhibition of a cell-based functional activity.  \n \nIn 190 patients treated with ELZONRIS in four clinical studies:  \n \n\u2022 94% (176/187) of patients evaluable for the presence of pre-existing ADA at baseline before \n\ntreatment were confirmed positive with 27% being positive for the presence of neutralising \nantibodies. The high prevalence of ADA at baseline was anticipated due to diphtheria \nimmunisation.  \n \n\n\u2022 100% (N=170) of patients evaluable for treatment-emergent ADA tested positive with most \npatients showing an increase in ADA titre by the end of Cycle 2 of ELZONRIS.  \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\u2022 92% (155/169) of ADA-positive patients evaluable for the presence of neutralising antibodies \npost-treatment were neutralising antibody-positive.  \n \n\n\u2022 75% (129/171) of patients evaluable for treatment-emergent anti-IL-3 antibodies tested positive \nwith most patients testing positive by Cycle 3 of ELZONRIS. \n \n\n\u2022 74% (93/126) of patients who tested positive for anti-IL-3 antibodies and were evaluable for the \npresence of neutralising antibodies were neutralising antibody-positive \n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere have been no cases of overdose reported with ELZONRIS. In case of overdose, patients should \nbe closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic \ntreatment provided immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents; other antineoplastic agents,  \nATC code: L01XX67  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTagraxofusp is a CD123-directed cytotoxin composed of recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and \ntruncated diphtheria toxin (DT) fusion protein that targets CD123-expressing cells. Tagraxofusp \nirreversibly inhibits protein synthesis of target cells by inactivating elongation factor 2 (EF2), resulting \nin apoptosis (cell death). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nStudy STML-401-0114 was a multi-stage (stage 1 dose escalation, stage 2 expansion, stage 3 \nconfirmatory, stage 4 continued access), non-randomised, open-label, multi-centre study of \nELZONRIS. ELZONRIS was administered to 65 previously-untreated and 19 previously treated adult \npatients with BPDCN according to the WHO classification who received a 12 mcg/kg dose on days \n1-5 of multiple 21-day cycles (Table 4). Patients who had known active or suspected CNS leukaemia \nwere not included in the study. The primary endpoint was the rate of complete response (CR; complete \nresolution of the disease)/clinical complete response (CRc; CR with residual skin abnormality not \nindicative of active disease).  Across all 65 previously untreated patients ELZONRIS resulted in a \nCR/CRc rate of 56.9% (95% CI: 44.0, 69.2), this included 13 patients in the confirmatory efficacy \ncohort where the CR/CRc rate was 53.8% (95% CI: 25.1, 80.8).   (Table 5). \n \nPatient baseline characteristics are presented in Table 4 and key efficacy measures  \nin Table 5. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 4: Baseline demographics of patients with treatment-na\u00efve BPDCN treated with \n12 mcg/kg of ELZONRIS   \n \n \n\nParameter \nTreatment-naive \n\nBPDCN \nN=65 \n\n  \nGender, N (%) \n\nMale \nFemale \n\n \n52 (80) \n13 (20) \n\nRace, N (%) \n     White \n      Other                                                                                                      \n\n \n57 (88) \n8 (12) \n\nAge (years) \nMedian \nMinimum, Maximum \n\n \n\n68 \n22, 84 \n\nECOG, N (%) \n0 \n1 \n2 \n\n31 (48) \n31 (48) \n\n2 (3) \n\nBPDCN at Baseline, N (%) \nSkin \nBone Marrow \nPeripheral Blood \nLymph Nodes \nVisceral \n\n \n60 (92) \n32 (49) \n17 (26) \n33 (51) \n10 (15) \n\n \nTable 5: Efficacy measures in patients with treatment-na\u00efve BPDCN treated with 12 mcg/kg of \nELZONRIS   \n \n \n\nParameter Confirmatory cohort \nN=13 \n\nTreatment-naive BPDCN \nN=65 \n\nResponse rate   \n\nCR/CRc* Rate, N (%) \n(95% CI) \nDuration of CR/CRc (months)** \n\nMedian \nMinimum, Maximum \n\n7 (54) \n(25.1, 80.8) \n\n \nNE \n\n4.7, 28.5 \n\n37 (57) \n(44.0, 62.9) \n\n \n7.3 \n\n0.7, 49.1  \nOverall response rate, N (%) \n(95% CI) \n\n10 (77) \n(46.2, 95.0) \n\n49 (75) \n(63.1, 85.2) \n\nBridge to stem cell transplant \nRate, N (%) \n(95% CI) \n\n \n6 (46) \n\n(19.2, 74.9) \n\n \n21 (32) \n\n(21.2, 45.1) \nOverall survival \n\nMedian \nMinimum, Maximum \n\n12-month survival, % (95% CI) \n18-month survival, % (95% CI) \n24-month survival, % (95% CI) \n\n \n18.9 (5.2, NE) \n\n0.2, 28.9 \n53.8 (24.8, 76.0) \n53.8 (24.8, 76.0) \n46.2 (19.2, 69.6) \n\n \n12.3 (9.3, 35.9) \n\n0.2, 49.7 \n52.2 (38.5, 64.2) \n48.2 (34.6, 60.5) \n40.9 (27.5, 53.9) \n\n* CRc is defined as complete response with residual skin abnormality not indicative of active disease. \n** Duration of CR/CRc includes patients bridged to stem cell transplantation. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nELZONRIS in all subsets of the paediatric population in BPDCN (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become \navailable every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tagraxofusp has been evaluated in 43 patients with BPDCN. Most patients \n(n=38) had pre-existing anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against the diphtheria toxin (DT) component, due \nto previous vaccination. Pre-existing ADAs resulted in higher clearance and lower tagraxofusp \nconcentrations. During treatment, all patients developed high ADA titres, and substantially reduced \nfree tagraxofusp levels (see below).  All data referred to below are based on free tagraxofusp \nconcentrations in BPDCN patients without pre-existing anti-drug antibodies (ADA, n=5) in the first \ntreatment cycle. Descriptive information is included for BPDCN patients with pre-existing ADAs \n(n=38). \n \nDistribution \nFollowing administration of ELZONRIS 12 mcg/kg via 15-minute infusion in patients with BPDCN \nwithout pre-existing anti-drug antibodies (ADA, N=5), the mean (SD) unbound area under the plasma \ndrug concentration over time curve (AUCunbound) of free tagraxofusp on Day 1 of the first cycle of \ntreatment (C1D1) was 230 (123) hr*mcg/L and maximum unbound plasma concentration (Cmax) was \n162 (58.1) mcg/L. \n \nThe mean (SD) volume of distribution of free tagraxofusp on C1D1 was 5.1 (1.9) L in 4 patients with \nBPDCN without pre-existing ADA. \n \nElimination \nTagraxofusp is expected to be degraded into peptides and its constituent amino acids through \nproteolysis, with no involvement of CYP or transporters.  \n \nThe mean (SD) clearance of free tagraxofusp at C1D1 was 7.1 (7.2) L/hr in 4 patients with BPDCN \nwithout pre-existing ADA, and the mean (SD) terminal half-life of tagraxofusp was 0.7 (0.3) hours.  \n \nAnti- drug antibody formation affecting pharmacokinetics  \nPatients with pre-existing ADA had lower unbound tagraxofusp plasma concentrations (AUC and \nCmax) at C1D1 than patients without pre-existing ADA. Due to the limitation of the bioanalytical \nmethod in the presence of ADA, quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters in these patients cannot be \ngiven.  \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nData collected during Cycle 3 showed increased titres of ADAs and substantially reduced free \ntagraxofusp concentrations.  However, clinical efficacy has been demonstrated beyond Cycle 1 despite \nthe reduced exposure. Due to the limitation of the bioanalytical method, the utility of free tagraxofusp \nconcentrations as a predictor of response is limited. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \nDue to the limitation of the bioanalytical method, the pharmacokinetics of tagraxofusp in patients with \nrenal or hepatic impairment and the effect of body weight, age, and gender are considered unknown. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of tagraxofusp have not been studied in the paediatric population. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have not been performed with tagraxofusp. Tagraxofusp is a \nrecombinant protein and is therefore not expected to interact directly with DNA.  \n \nAt human equivalent doses greater than or equal to 1.6 times the recommended dose based on body \nsurface area, severe kidney tubular degeneration/necrosis was observed in cynomolgus monkeys. At \nhuman equivalent doses equal to the recommended dose, degeneration/necrosis of the choroid plexus \nin the brain was observed in cynomolgus monkeys. These findings were generally noted after 5 days \nof daily dosing. The reversibility of this finding was not assessed at lower doses, but the finding was \nirreversible and became progressively more severe at a human equivalent dose 1.6 times the \nrecommended dose, 3 weeks after dosing stopped.  It is unknown if these findings are CD123 \nreceptor-mediated or non-receptor mediated effects since binding of tagraxofusp to cynomolgus \nmonkey CD123 has not been demonstrated. These findings in kidney and choroid plexus are \nconsidered likely relevant for the clinical situation. \n \nNo fertility studies have been conducted with tagraxofusp. A literature-based risk assessment suggests \nthat exposure to exogenous IL-3 or blockade of IL-3 signaling may have embryotoxic effects on foetal \nhaematopoiesis and embryo-foetal development. The effects of diphtheria toxin exposure on placental \nand embryo-foetal development are unknown. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you are given ELZONRIS \n3. How ELZONRIS is given \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store ELZONRIS \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What ELZONRIS is and what it is used for \n \nELZONRIS contains the active substance tagraxofusp. Tagraxofusp, an anti-cancer medicine, is made \nfrom two proteins from different sources. One of the proteins can kill cancer cells. This protein is \ndelivered to the cancer cell by the second protein. \n \nELZONRIS is used to treat adult patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).  \n \nBPDCN is a cancer of a rare type of immature immune cells called \u2018plasmacytoid dendritic cells\u2019.  It \ncan affect many organs including the skin, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given ELZONRIS  \n \nDo not use ELZONRIS \n- if you are allergic to tagraxofusp or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before using ELZONRIS and during treatment if you: \n \n- suddenly gain weight after starting treatment, have new or worsening swelling of your face, limbs \n\nor joints (oedema) or dizziness (a symptom of low blood pressure). These may be signs of a \npotentially life-threatening condition known as capillary leak syndrome. For more information see \n\u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d in section 4. \n\n- get a whistling sound during breathing (wheezing) or have difficulty breathing, hives/ rash, \nitching, or swelling (signs of an allergic reaction).  \n\n- have been told you have a low level of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia). \n- have been told you have a low level of a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil (neutropenia). \n\n\n\n29 \n\n- have dizziness, decreased urination, confusion, vomiting, nausea, swelling, shortness of breath, or \nchanges in heart rhythm (signs of  tumour lysis syndrome). \n\n- have abnormal liver test results (possible sign of serious liver injury). \n- have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder which means you can\u2019t break \n\ndown sugar in foods and drinks.  \n- have kidney or liver problems. \n- start getting headaches, or feeling confused or drowsy, or having speech, vision or memory \n\nproblems. \n- have been told you have cancer in your central nervous system (CNS). You may be given a \n\ndifferent medicine to treat this. \n \n\nYour doctor will monitor you and perform regular blood tests to make sure that it is safe for you to use \nthis medicine. If you have any problems, your treatment may be temporarily stopped and started again \nwhen you feel better. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nELZONRIS is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. This is because there is limited \ninformation on how well it works in this age group.  \n \nOther medicines and ELZONRIS  \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nYou should not use this medicine if you are pregnant unless you and your doctor decide that the \nbenefit to you outweighs the potential risk to the unborn baby .  \n \nYou should not breast-feed during treatment with ELZONRIS and for at least 1 week after your last \ndose. It is not known if ELZONRIS passes into breast-milk. \n \nIf you are a woman who can become pregnant, you will have a pregnancy test about a week before \nstarting treatment with ELZONRIS.  \n \nYou should continue to take your contraception for at least 1 week after your last dose of ELZONRIS. \nTalk to your doctor about the best contraception for you and before stopping your contraception.   \n \nDriving and using machines \nTagraxofusp is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nELZONRIS contains sorbitol (E420) and sodium \nSorbitol is a source of fructose. If you have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic \ndisorder, you must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which \nmay cause serious side effects. \n \nYou must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you have HFI or if you can no longer take \nsweet foods or drinks because you feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects such as bloating, stomach \ncramps or diarrhoea. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How ELZONRIS is given \n \nELZONRIS will be given to you in a hospital or clinic under the supervision of a doctor.  \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nAbout an hour before your treatment begins, you will be given medicines to help prevent an allergic \nreaction, including anti-histamines, a corticosteroid and paracetamol.  \n \nThe amount of ELZONRIS given to you is based on your body weight and will be calculated by your \ndoctor. The daily recommended dose is 12 micrograms per kilogram of your body weight.  It is given \nas a 15-minute drip into a vein (intravenous infusion), once a day, for the first 5 days of a 21-day \ncycle. \n \nThe first cycle will be given to you in hospital. You will be monitored for any side effectsduring \ntreatment and for at least 24 hours after the last dose. \n \nYou will usually have more than one cycle of treatment. Your doctor will decide how many treatments \nyou will receive. \n \nIf the first cycle does not cause troublesome side effects, your next cycle of treatment may be given in \na clinic. You will be monitored during treatment. \n \nIf you miss a dose of ELZONRIS  \nIt is very important for you to keep all your appointments to receive ELZONRIS. If you miss an \nappointment, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose.  \n \nIf you stop using ELZONRIS  \nDo not stop treatment with ELZONRIS without first talking to your doctor. Stopping your treatment \nmay make your condition worse. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Do not refreeze a vial once \nthawed. \n \nDetermining dosage amount   \nCalculation to determine the total ELZONRIS dose (mL) to be administered (see section 4.2):   \n \n\nELZONRIS dose (mcg/kg) x  patient's body weight (kg)\nDiluted vial concentration (100 mcg/ml)\n\n=  Total dose (mL) to be administered \n\n \n \nA 2-step process is required for preparation of the final ELZONRIS dose:  \n \nStep 1 -prepare 10 mL of 100 mcg/mL ELZONRIS  \n\n- Using a sterile 10 mL syringe, transfer 9 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection to an empty sterile 10 mL vial. \n\n- Gently swirl the ELZONRIS vial to mix the contents, remove the cap, and using a sterile 1 mL \nsyringe, withdraw 1 mL of thawed ELZONRIS from the product vial. \n\n- Transfer the 1 mL of ELZONRIS into the 10 mL vial containing the 9 mL of sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Gently invert the vial at least 3 times to mix the \ncontents. Do not shake vigorously. \n\n- Following dilution the final concentration of ELZONRIS is 100 mcg/mL. \n \n\nStep 2 \u2013 Prepare the ELZONRIS infusion set. \n- Calculate the required volume of diluted ELZONRIS (100 mcg/mL) according to patient\u2019s \n\nweight. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n- Draw up the required volume into a new syringe (if more than 10 mL of diluted ELZONRIS \n(100 mcg/mL) is required for the calculated patient dose, repeat step 1 with a second vial of \nELZONRIS). Label the ELZONRIS syringe. \n\n- Prepare a separate syringe with at least 3 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection to be used to flush the administration set once the ELZONRIS dose is delivered. \n\n- Label the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection flush syringe. \n- Connect the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection flush syringe to one arm \n\nof the Y-connector and ensure the clamp is closed. \n- Connect the product syringe to the other arm of the Y-connector and ensure the clamp is \n\nclosed. \n- Connect the terminal end of the Y-connector to the microbore tubing. \n- Remove the cap from the supply side of the 0.2 \u00b5m filter and attach it to the terminal end of \n\nthe microbore tubing. \n- Unclamp the arm of the Y-connector connected to the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection flush syringe. Prime the Y-connector up to the intersection (do not prime \nthe full infusion set with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection). Re-clamp \nthe Y-connector line on the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection flush arm. \n\n- Remove the cap on the terminal end of the 0.2 \u00b5m filter and set it aside. Unclamp the arm of \nthe Y-connector connected to the product syringe, and prime the entire infusion set, including \nthe filter. Recap the filter, and re-clamp the Y-connector line on the product side. The infusion \nset is now ready for delivery for dose administration. \n\n \nThe diluted solution should be used immediately once prepared. \n \nAdministration \n \n\n1. Establish venous access and maintain with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution \nfor injection. \n\n2. Administer the prepared ELZONRIS dose via infusion with an infusion syringe pump over \n15 minutes. The total infusion time will be controlled using an infusion syringe pump to \ndeliver the entire dose and the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection flush \nover 15 minutes.  \n\n3. Insert the ELZONRIS syringe into the infusion syringe pump, open the clamp on the \nELZONRIS side of the Y-connector and deliver the prepared ELZONRIS dose.  \n\n4. Once the ELZONRIS syringe has been emptied, remove it from the pump and place the \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection flush syringe in the infusion syringe \npump. \n\n5. Open the clamp on the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection flush side of \nthe Y-connector and resume infusion via the infusion syringe pump at the pre-specified flow \nto push the remaining ELZONRIS dose out of the infusion line to complete delivery.  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n\nCONCLUSIONS ON THE GRANTING OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION UNDER \nEXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nConclusions presented by the European Medicines Agency on: \n\n\u2022 Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances \n\nThe CHMP having considered the application is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance is \nfavourable to recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances \nas further explained in the European Public Assessment Report. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

given as a 15-minute drip into a vein (intravenous infusion), once a day, for the first 5 days of a 21-day cycle. the first cycle will be given to you in hospital. you will be monitored for any side effectsduring treatment and for at least 24 hours after the last dose. you will usually have more than one cycle of treatment. your doctor will decide how many treatments you will receive. if the first cycle does not cause troublesome side effects, your next cycle of treatment may be given in a clinic. you will be monitored during treatment. if you miss a dose of elzonris it is very important for you to keep all your appointments to receive elzonris. if you miss an appointment, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose. if you stop using elzonris do not stop treatment with elzonris

abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. these symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. these could be symptoms of a condition called \"capillary leak syndrome\" which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. other side effects: tell your doctor if you notice any of the following side effects: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): - abnormal blood tests (decreased platelets [thrombocytopenia]; red blood cells [anaemia]; decreased albumin in the blood [hypoalbuminemia])
