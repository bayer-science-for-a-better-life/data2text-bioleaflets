NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nBronchitol 40 mg inhalation powder, hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 40 mg mannitol. \n\n \n\nMean delivered dose per capsule is 32.2 mg. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nInhalation powder, hard capsule. \n\n \n\nClear colourless hard capsules marked with ‘PXS 40 mg’ and containing white or almost white \n\npowder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nBronchitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as \n\nan add-on therapy to best standard of care. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nInitiation dose assessment \n\nBefore commencing treatment with Bronchitol all patients should be assessed for bronchial \n\nhyperresponsiveness to inhaled mannitol during administration of their initiation dose (see sections \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\nThe patient’s initiation dose of Bronchitol must be used under the supervision and monitoring of an \n\nexperienced physician or another health care professional appropriately trained and equipped to \n\nperform spirometry, monitor oxygen saturation (SpO2), and manage acute bronchospasm (see sections \n\n4.4 and 4.8) including appropriate use of resuscitation equipment. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe patient should be pre-medicated with a bronchodilator 5-15 minutes prior to the initiation dose \n\nbut after the baseline FEV1 and SpO2 (Oxygen saturation in the blood) measurement. All FEV1 \n\nmeasurements and SpO2 monitoring should be performed 60 seconds after dose inhalation. \n\n \n\nTraining the patient to practice correct inhaler technique during the initiation dose assessment is \n\nimportant. \n\n \n\nThe initiation dose assessment must be performed according to the following steps: \n\n \n\n Step 1: Patients baseline FEV1 and SpO2 is measured prior to the initiation dose \n\n Step 2: Patient inhales 40 mg (1x40 mg capsules) and SpO2 is monitored \n\n Step 3: Patient inhales 80 mg (2x40 mg capsules) and SpO2 is monitored \n\n Step 4: Patient inhales 120 mg (3x40 mg capsules), FEV1 is measured and SpO2 is monitored \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n Step 5: Patient inhales 160 mg (4x40 mg capsules), FEV1 is measured and SpO2 is monitored \n\n Step 6: Patients FEV1 is measured 15 minutes post initiation dose. \n\n \n\nPatients with asthma may experience reversible temporary mild bronchospasm after passing the \n\ninitiation dose assessment and therefore all patients should be monitored until their FEV1 has returned \n\nto baseline levels. \n\n \n\nTherapeutic dose regimen \n\nThe therapeutic dose regimen should not be prescribed until the initiation dose assessment has been \n\nperformed. The patient must complete and pass the initiation dose assessment before starting \n\ntreatment with Bronchitol. \n\n \n\n \n\nA bronchodilator must be administered 5-15 minutes before each dose of Bronchitol. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Bronchitol is 400 mg twice a day. This requires the inhalation of the \n\ncontents of ten capsules via the inhaler device twice a day. \n\nThe doses should be taken morning and night with the evening dose taken 2-3 hours before bedtime. \n\n \n\nFor patients receiving several respiratory therapies, the recommended order is: \n\n \n\n1. Bronchodilator   \n\n2. Bronchitol \n\n3. Physiotherapy/exercise \n\n4. Dornase alfa (if applicable) \n\n5. Inhaled antibiotics (if applicable) \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients (≥65 years) \n\nThere are insufficient data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose \n\nadjustment. \n\n \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment \n\nBronchitol has not formally been studied in patients with impaired renal and hepatic function. \n\nAvailable data from studies DPM-CF-301 and 302 suggest that no dose adjustments are required for \n\nthese patient populations. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Bronchitol in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years has not yet been \n\nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation \n\non a posology can be made. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Bronchitol in children aged less than 6 years has not been established. No \n\ndata are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nBronchitol is for inhalation use, using the inhaler provided in the pack. It must not be administered by \n\nany other route or using any other inhaler. The capsules must not be swallowed. \n\n \n\nEach of the capsules is loaded into the device separately. The contents of the capsules are inhaled via \n\nthe inhaler device with one or two breaths. After inhalation, each empty capsule is discarded before \n\ninserting the next capsule into the inhaler device with as little delay as possible between capsules. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nThe inhaler device is to be replaced after one week of use. If the inhaler does require cleaning, it must \n\nbe ensured that the device is empty, then it should be washed in warm water and before re-use,the \n\ninhaler should be allowed to thoroughly air dry. \n\n \n\nDetailed instructions on how to use the inhaler can be found in the patient information leaflet. Patients \n\nshould be advised to carefully read them. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance. \n\n \n\nBronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled mannitol (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHyperresponsiveness to mannitol \n\nPatients must be monitored for bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled mannitol during their \n\ninitiation dose assessment before commencing the therapeutic dose regimen of Bronchitol.If the \n\npatient is unable to perform spirometry or complete the initiation dose assessment, they must not be \n\nprescribed Bronchitol. Hyperresponsive patients should not be prescribed the therapeutic dose \n\nregimen of Bronchitol (see section 4.3).The usual precautions regarding bronchial \n\nhyperresponsiveness monitoring apply (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nA patient is defined as hyperresponsive to inhaled mannitol and must not be prescribed the therapeutic \n\ndose regimen if they experience any of the following during the initiation dose assessment: \n\n \n\n- ≥10% fall from baseline in SpO2 at any point of the assessment; \n\n- FEV1 fall from baseline is ≥20% at 240 mg cumulative dose; \n\n- FEV1 has fallen 20-<50% (from baseline) at the end of the assessment and does not return to \n\n<20% within 15 minutes; \n\n- FEV1 has fallen ≥50% (from baseline) at the end of the assessment. \n\n \n\nIf a therapy induced hyperresponsive reaction is suspected, Bronchitol should be discontinued. \n\nAll patients should be monitored until their FEV1 has returned to baseline levels. \n\n \n\nBronchospasm \n\nBronchospasm can occur with inhalation of medicinal product and has been reported with Bronchitol \n\nin clinical studies, even in patients who were not hyperresponsive to the initiation dose of inhaled \n\nmannitol (see section 4.8). Bronchospasm should be treated with a bronchodilator or as medically \n\nappropriate. \n\n \n\nIf there is evidence of therapy induced bronchospasm, the physician should carefully evaluate whether \n\nthe benefits of continued use of Bronchitol outweigh the risks to the patient. \n\n \n\nAll patients should be formally reviewed after approximately six weeks of Bronchitol treatment to \n\nassess for signs and symptoms suggestive of active substance induced bronchospasm. The initiation \n\ndose assessment described in section 4.2 should be repeated if uncertainty exists. \n\n \n\nAsthma \n\nThe safety/efficacy of Bronchitol in patients with asthma has not been formally studied. Patients with \n\nasthma must be carefully monitored for worsening signs and symptoms of asthma after the initiation \n\ndose of Bronchitol. \n\n \n\nPatients must be advised to report worsening signs and symptoms of asthma during therapeutic use \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nto their physician. If there is evidence of therapy induced bronchospasm, the physician should \n\ncarefully evaluate whether the benefits of continued use of Bronchitol outweigh the risks to the \n\npatient. Bronchospasm should be treated with a bronchodilator or as medically appropriate. \n\n \n\nHaemoptysis \n\nHaemoptysis has been commonly reported with Bronchitol in clinical studies. Bronchitol has not been \nstudied in patients with a history of significant episodes of haemoptysis (>60 ml) in the previous three \n\nmonths. As a consequence, these patients should be carefully monitored, and Bronchitol should be \n\nwithheld in the event of massive haemoptysis. A massive/serious haemoptysis is considered to be: \n\n acute bleeding ≥240 ml in a 24-hour period \n\n recurrent bleeding ≥100 ml/day over several days  \n\nThe reinstitution or withholding of Bronchitol following smaller episodes of haemoptysis should be \n\nbased on clinical judgement. \n\n \n\nCough \n\nCough was  commonly reported with use of Bronchitol in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Patients \n\nshould be trained to practice correct inhaler technique during treatment and advised to report \n\npersistent cough with the use of Bronchitol to their physician. \n\n  \n\nImpaired lung function \n\nSafety and efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients with a FEV1 of less than 30% of predicted \n\n(see section 5.1). The use of Bronchitol is not recommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nNon-CF Bronchiectasis \n\nEfficacy and safety have not been established in non-CF bronchiectasis patients. Therefore, treatment \n\nwith Bronchitol is not recommended. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo formal interaction studies have been conducted. \n\nHowever, Bronchitol has been used in clinical studies in conjunction with standard cystic fibrosis \n\ntherapies such as mucolytics, antibiotics (including tobramycin and colistimethate sodium), \n\nbronchodilators, pancreatic enzymes, vitamins, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, and analgesics. \n\n \n\nThere are no data on concomitant use of hypertonic saline with Bronchitol as it was excluded from the \n\nPhase 3 studies. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are limited data from the use of mannitol in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \n\ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As the effects \n\nof a possible hyperresponsive reaction on the mother and/or foetus are unknown, caution should be \n\nexercised when prescribing Bronchitol to pregnant women. As a precautionary measure, it is \n\npreferable to avoid the use of Bronchitol during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nIt is unknown whether mannitol is excreted in human milk. The excretion of mannitol in milk has not \n\nbeen studied in animals. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made \n\nwhether to discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue Bronchitol therapy taking into account the \n\nbenefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of Bronchitol therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nFor mannitol no clinical data on fertility is available. Animal reproduction studies have not been \n\ncarried out with inhaled mannitol. However, studies with orally administered mannitol indicate no \n\nfertility effects (see section 5.3). \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nBronchitol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n  The safety profile of Bronchitol has been evaluated in clinical studies involving more than 1200 \n\npatients. (See Table 1). \n\n \n\nInitiation dose assessment \n\nThe most commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of Bronchitol during the \n\ninitiation dose assessment is cough (2.9% of patients), (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nThe most important adverse reaction associated with the use of Bronchitol during the initiation dose \n\nassessment is bronchospasm (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nTherapeutic dose regimen \n\nThe most commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of Bronchitol is cough (see \n\nsection 4.4). This was observed in 8.3% of patients compared to 4.0% of patients in the control arm. \n\nCough which led to cessation of treatment was also commonly experienced and was observed in 4.0% \n\nof patients in the Bronchitol treatment arm. \n\n \n\nThe most important adverse reaction associated with the use of Bronchitol is haemoptysis. The \n\nproportion of patients who experienced haemoptysis as an adverse reaction was 7.3%, 3.3% and 3.4% \n\nin the Bronchitol arms for studies 301, 302 and 303 respectively vs. 3.4%, 0% and 5.6% in the control \n\narms. The proportion of patients who experienced haemoptysis  including haemoptysis reported \n\nduring exacerbation was 7.0% in the mannitol arm and 7.7% in the control arm (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe safety profile of Bronchitol is based on the safety data from Phase III clinical studies (including \n\ndata from the initiation dose assessment). \n\n \n\n \n\nFrequencies are defined as: \n\nVery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 \n\nto <1/1,000); very rare (≥1/100,000 to <1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata). \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Frequency of adverse reactions with Bronchitol in the phase 3 studies (initiation dose \n\nassessment and/or treatment phase)  \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse Reaction \n\nInfections and infestations Uncommon Bacterial disease carrier, Bronchitis, \n\nBronchopneumonia, Lung infection, Oral \n\ncandidiasis, Pharyngitis, Staphylococcal \n\ninfection, Upper respiratory tract infection \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon Decreased appetite, CF related diabetes, \n\nDehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon Initial insomnia, Morbid thoughts \n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache \n\nUncommon Dizziness \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Uncommon Ear pain \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\n \n\nCommon Cough, Haemoptysis,  \n\nOropharyngeal pain, Wheezing \n\nUncommon Productive cough, Throat irritation,  \n\nAsthma, Bronchospasm, Forced expiratory \n\nvolume decreased, Rhinorrhoea, Dyspnoea, \n\nDysphonia, Hyperventilation, Obstructive \n\nairways disorder, Respiratory tract congestion, \n\nSputum discoloured, Hypoxia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Post-tussive vomiting, Vomiting \n\nUncommon Nausea, Diarrhoea, Eructation, \n\nFlatulence, Gastrooesophageal reflux disease, \n\nGlossodynia, Retching, Stomatitis, Abdominal \n\npain upper, Aphthous Stomatitis, Odynophagia  \n\n  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon Acne, Cold sweat, Pruritus, Rash, Rash pruritic \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Musculoskeletal chest pain, Arthralgia, Back \n\npain, Joint stiffness, Musculoskeletal pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Uncommon Urinary incontinence \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nCommon Condition aggravated, Chest discomfort \n\nUncommon Pyrexia, Fatigue, Influenza like illness, Hernia \n\npain, Malaise, Chest pain \n\nInvestigations Uncommon Blood alkaline phosphatase increased, Bacteria or \n\nfungus sputum test positive \nAdverse reactions that occurred only with the initiation dose assessment (MTT) are dehydration, forced \n\nexpiratory volume decreased, hypoxia, diarrhoea, abdominal pain upper, aphthous stomatitis, odynophagia, chest \n\npain and blood alkaline phosphatase increased. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nTwenty seven (7.1%) out of 378 patients who undertook the mannitol tolerance test (MTT)  in study \n\n301, 18 (5.3%) out of 341 patientsin study 302 and 25 (5.1%) out of 486 patients in Study 303  had  a \n\npositive  (MTT).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cough and cold preparations, Mucolytic. ATC code: R05CB16 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nBronchitol is an inhaled hyperosmotic medicinal product. While the exact mechanism of action is \n\nunknown, inhaled mannitol may change the viscoelastic properties of mucus, increase the hydration of \n\nthe periciliary fluid layer and contribute to increased mucus clearance of the retained secretions \n\nthrough mucociliary activity. Productive cough can contribute to sputum clearance.  \n\n   \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nIn the ITT population of an open label dose response study, DPM-CF-202, the mean (SD) percent \n\nchange in FEV1 for the 400 mg dose was 8.75 (SD: 12.4) and -1.569 (SD: 9.0) for 40 mg dose (p < \n\n0.0001).  \n\n  \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThree Phase 3, 26-week double blind, randomised, parallel arm, controlled, intervention studies \n\n(DPM-CF-301,DPM-CF-302 and DPM-CF-303) have been performed in which 324 (DPM-CF-301) \n\nand 318 (DPM-CF-302) patients aged 6 years and above were randomised in a 3:2 ratio to inhaled \n\nmannitol 400 mg twice daily or to control (inhaled mannitol 50 mg twice daily). In the third study \n\n(DPM-CF-303) 423 adult patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to inhaled mannitol 400 mg twice \n\ndaily or to control. Twenty seven (7.1%) out of 378 patients who undertook the mannitol tolerance \n\ntest (MTT) in study 301, 18 (5.3) out of 341 patients in study 302 and 25 out of 486 patients (5.1%) in \n\nstudy 303 had  a positive  MTT defined as either 1) a fall in FEV1 >20% from baseline at midpoint \n\n(step 4) or 2) fall from baseline > 20 % at end of test that did not recover to < 20% within 15 minutes \n\nor 3) who had a fall in FEV1 > 50% from baseline at end of test (step 6) or 4) who had a fall in Sp02 \n\nto < 89% during the procedure. An additional 2.8% (n=34) of patients from the three studies had \n\nincomplete MTTs and were not randomised. \n\n \n\nMean (SD) baseline FEV1 percent predicted in study DPM-CF-301 (safety population, N= 295) was \n\n62.4 (SD:16.45) and 61.4 (SD:16.13) in the mannitol and control groups, respectively. These figures \n\nfor study DPM-CF-302 (N=305) are as follows: 65.24 (SD:13.90) and 64.35 (SD:15.29). In study \n\nDPM-CF-303 (N=423) the baseline FEV1 percent predicted was 63.17 (SD: 15.15) and 62.98 (SD: \n\n13.65).In study DPM-CF-301 64.4 % of the patient population were adults while in study DPM-CF-\n\n302 this figure was 49.5%. Study DPM-CF-303 was all adult patients. Fifty five % of patients were \n\nreceiving rhDNase in study DPM-CF-301 while in study DPM-CF-302 this number was 75% and for \n\nDPM-CF-303 this was 67.6%. The percentage of patients receiving inhaled antibiotics was 55% in \n\nstudy DPM-CF-301, 56% in study DPM-CF-302 and 52% in Study DPM-CF-303. Concomitant \n\nadministration with hypertonic saline was not permitted in these trials.  \n\n \n\nThe primary pre-specified endpoint i.e. the change from baseline in FEV1 (ml) in the modified ITT \n\n(mITT) population (n=269, 297 and 423 in studies DPM-CF-301,DPM-CF-302 and DPM-CF-303, \n\nrespectively) compared to control over the 26 weeks period is provided in Table 3 alongside FEV1 \n\npresented as absolute and relative change % predicted. \n\n \n\nTable 3 – Change in FEV1 from baseline over 26 weeks in the mITT and adult populations \n\n \n\n Effect size estimate \n\n DPM-CF-301 DPM-CF-302 DPM-CF-303 \n\n \nFEV1  \n\n(95% CI) \np value  \n\nFEV1  \n\n(95% CI) \np value \n\nFEV1  \n\n(95% CI) \np value \n\n Overall Population  \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n N=269 N=297 N=423 \n\nAbsolute mL  \n94.5 \n\n(46.2, 142.7)  \n<0.001  \n\n54.1 \n\n(-1.97, 110.3)  \n0.059 \n\n54  \n\n(8, 100) \n\n0.020 \n\nAbsolute % \n\npredicted  \n\n2.4 \n\n(0.9, 3.9)  \n0.001  \n\n1.9 \n\n(-0.02, 3.8)  \n0.052 \n\n1.2  \n\n(0.07, 2.4) \n\n0.037 \n\nRelative % \n\npredicted \n\n3.5 \n\n(1.0, 6.1)  \n0.007  \n\n3.6 \n\n(0.3, 6.9)  \n0.033  \n\n2.3  \n\n(0.3, 4.2) \n\n0.024 \n\n Adult Population  \n\n N=171 N=144 N=423 \n\nAbsolute mL  \n108.5 \n\n(47.6, 169.4)  \n<0.001  \n\n85.9 \n\n(4.6, 167.3)  \n0.038 \n\n54  \n\n(8, 100) \n\n0.020 \n\nAbsolute % \n\npredicted  \n\n2.7 \n\n(0.9, 4.5)  \n0.004  \n\n2.3 \n\n(-0.4, 5.1)  \n0.095 \n\n1.2  \n\n(0.07, 2.4) \n\n0.037 \n\nRelative % \n\npredicted \n\n4.3  \n\n(1.1, 7.5)  \n0.008  \n\n5.0  \n\n(0.2, 9.8)  \n0.040  \n\n2.3 \n\n(0.3, 4.2) \n\n0.024 \n\nNote: There were some differences in analysis methods across the 3 studies.  In DPM-CF-303 imputation of \n\nmissing data was performed using a baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) approach whereas no \n\nimputation was performed in DPM-CF-301 or DPM-CF-302. \n\n \n\nThe treatment effect of Bronchitol on FEV1 was less evident in the subgroup of patients who were \n\nreceiving concomitant rhDNase.In rhDNase users in study 301 the relative change in FEV1 % \n\npredicted from baseline across 26 weeks of treatment was  2.83 (95% CI -0.62, 6.27). For non-users \n\nthe relative change was 4.30 (95% CI 0.53, 8.07). In study 302 the relative change (95% CI) for \n\nrhDNase users and non-users was 3.21 (-0.61, 7.03) and 4.73 (-1.93, 11.40), respectively. In study 303 \n\nthe relative change (95% CI) for rhDNase users and non-users was 1.30 (-0.91, 3.51) and 4.45 (0.52, \n\n8.38), respectively. \n\n \n\nStudy 303 did not show a superior treatment effect of Bronchitol on FEV1 for female patients, in \n\nwhom the underlying cystic fibrosis disease course may be worse than males for reasons that are not \n\nfully understood. In female patients, the adjusted mean change in FEV1 was 27ml for Bronchitol and \n\n44ml for the control arm, suggesting potentially inferior benefit on lung function with Bronchitol \n\ncompared to the control, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.480). \n\n \n\nThe number of subjects with at least one protocol defined pulmonary exacerbation (PDPE, defined by \n\nthe presence of at least 4 symptoms and signs plus the use of intravenous antibiotics) was 18.1% in \n\nthe mannitol arm and 28% in the control arm in study 301 (ITT population).  In study 302 15.2% \n\nsubjects in the mannitol arm and 19% in the control had a PDPE. In study 303 13.4% subjects in the \n\nmannitol arm and 13.6% in the control had a PDPE.  \n\n \n\nThe estimated effect of treatment (mean change and 95% CI from baseline over 26 weeks, mITT \n\npopulation) on FVC was 108.78 ml (95% CI: 49.21, 168.35) in study 301 and 71.4 ml (95% CI: 10.57, \n\n132.13) in study 302 and 40 ml (95% CI: -12, 92) in study 303. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Bronchitol in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not been \n\nestablished (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nIn studies DPM-CF-301 and 302 relative % predicted FEV1 compared to control in children (6-11 \n\nyears) was improved by 0.44% (95% CI -5.90, 6.77, N=43) and 6.1% (95% CI -1.28, 13.54, N=59) \n\nover 26 weeks (p=0.892 and 0.104) respectively.  \n\n \n\nIn adolescents (12-17 years) relative change in % predicted FEV1 compared to control improved by \n\n3.31% (95% CI -2.29, 8.90, N=55) and 0.42% (95% CI -5.45, 6.29, N=94) over 26 weeks (p=0.245 \n\nand 0.888) respectively.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nIn a study of 18 healthy male adult volunteers, the absolute bioavailability of mannitol powder for \n\ninhalation by comparison to mannitol administered intravenously was 0.59% ± 0.15. \n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of mannitol after inhaled administration was very similar to that \n\nobserved after oral administration. The Tmax after inhaled administration was 1.5 ± 0.5 hours. \n\n \n\nIn a study of 9 cystic fibrosis patients (6 adults, 3 adolescents), using 400 mg inhaled mannitol as a \n\nsingle dose (Day 1) then twice a day for 7 days (Days 2 - 7), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar \n\nfor adults and adolescents, except for a longer average apparent terminal half life for adolescents \n\n(Day 1 = 7.29 hours, Day 7 = 6.52 hours) compared with adults (Day 1 = 6.10 hours, \n\nDay 7 = 5.42 hours). Overall, the comparison of AUCs between Day 1 and Day 7 showed a time \n\nindependence of pharmacokinetics, indicating linearity at the dose level administered in this study. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nA small percentage of systemically absorbed mannitol undergoes hepatic metabolism to glycogen and \n\ncarbon dioxide. Studies in rats, mice and humans have demonstrated that mannitol has no toxic \n\nmetabolites. The metabolic pathway of inhaled mannitol was not examined in pharmacokinetic \n\nstudies. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nLung deposition studies have demonstrated a 24.7% deposition of inhaled mannitol confirming its \n\ndistribution to the target organ. Nonclinical toxicology studies indicate that mannitol inhaled into the \n\nlungs is absorbed into the bloodstream, with the maximum serum concentration being achieved \n\noccurring at 1 hour. There is no evidence that mannitol is accumulated in the body, therefore \n\ndistribution of inhaled mannitol was not examined in PK studies. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe cumulative amount of mannitol filtered into the urine over the 24 hour collection period was \n\nsimilar for inhaled (55%) and oral (54%) mannitol. When administered intravenously, mannitol is \n\neliminated largely unchanged by glomerular filtration and 87% of the dose is excreted in the urine \n\nwithin 24 hours. The mean terminal half-life in adults was approximately 4 to 5 hours from serum and \n\napproximately 3.66 hours from urine. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Bronchitol in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years has not yet been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nThe limited data available in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years indicate the pharmacokinetic parameters \n\nof inhaled mannitol are similar to the adult population.  \n\n \n\nThere are no data available for children under 12 years of age. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn male rats after 13 weeks of inhaled mannitol dosing, elevated circulating lymphocyte numbers and \n\nmandibular lymph node plasmacytosis was observed at doses greater than 9.3 fold the maximal dose. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nThe elevated lymphocyte count was within historical control values, did not progress and was \n\nessentially resolved by the end of the in life phase of the study and following withdrawal of treatment. \n\nThis effect was not noted in any other species and did not result in clinical signs. \n\n \n\nIn dogs an increased occurrence of coughing was observed both during and immediately post dose for \n\nlow and high dose inhaled mannitol administration. No treatment-related adverse effect occurred \n\ngreater than 13 fold the maximal therapeutic dose. \n\n \n\nNo mutagenic or genotoxic effect has been revealed when mannitol was assayed in a standard battery \n\nof genotoxicity tests. \n\n \n\nMannitol was shown not to be an irritant in an isolated bovine eye assay or when introduced into \n\nrabbit eyes. \n\n \n\nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was observed when dietary mannitol (≤5%) was administered to mice \n\nand rats for 2 years. Carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out with inhaled mannitol. \n\n \n\nReproduction and developmental toxicity studies have not been carried out with inhaled mannitol. \n\nHowever, studies conducted with mannitol administered via other routes indicated no effect on foetal \n\nsurvival in mice, rats and hamsters and on embryo and foetal development in rats and rabbits. \n\n \n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been carried out with inhaled mannitol. However, studies \n\nconducted with orally administered mannitol indicated no teratogenic effects in mice or rats, at doses \n\nof up to 1.6 g/kg, or in hamsters at 1.2 g/kg. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n  \n\n1. What Bronchitol is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Bronchitol is \n\nBronchitol contains a medicine called mannitol which is a mucolytic agent. \n\n \n\nWhat Bronchitol is used for \n\nBronchitol is for use in adults 18 years of age and over. As well as using Bronchitol you will normally \n\nkeep using the other medicines you take for cystic fibrosis.  \n\n \n\nHow Bronchitol works \n\nBronchitol is inhaled into the lungs to help with cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease that affects the \n\nglands in the lungs, gut and pancreas that secrete fluids such as mucus and digestive juices. \n\n \n\nBronchitol helps by increasing the amount of water on the surface of your airways and in your mucus. \n\nThis helps your lungs to clear mucus more easily. It also helps improve the condition of your lungs \n\nand your breathing. As a result you may get a ‘productive cough’, which also helps to remove mucus \n\nfrom your lungs. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Bronchitol \n\n \n\nDo not use Bronchitol \n\n- if you are allergic to mannitol  \n\n- if you are sensitive to mannitol. Before you are started on Bronchitol, your doctor will check \n\nwhether your airways are too sensitive to mannitol. If you are too sensitive to mannitol, your \n\nairways will become narrower, and you may find it harder to breathe. \n\nIf either of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using \n\nthis medicine. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using this medicine: \n\n- if you have asthma; \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n- if you have ever coughed up blood or had blood in your sputum; \n\n- if you have severe cystic fibrosis, in particular if your lung function measured by the Forced \n\nExpiratory Volume in first second of expiration (FEV1) is usually less than 30%. \n\n \n\nInhaling medicines can cause chest tightness and wheezing and this can happen immediately after \n\ntaking this medicine. Your doctor will help you take your first dose of Bronchitol and check your lung \n\nfunction before, during and after dosing. Your doctor may ask you to use other medicines such as a \n\nbronchodilator before taking Bronchitol. \n\n \n\nInhaling medicines can also cause cough and this can happen with Bronchitol. Talk to your doctor if \n\nthe cough won’t go away or worries you. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nBronchitol should not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18. This is because there \n\nis limited information in this group of people. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Bronchitol \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nYou can carry on using your medicines for cystic fibrosis when you are using Bronchitol, this \n\nincludes inhaled antibiotics such as tobramycin and colistimethate sodium. If you are not sure, talk to \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist before using Bronchitol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\n- If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before using this medicine. You should avoid using this medicine if you are \n\npregnant. \n\n- If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed ask your doctor for advice before using this \n\nmedicine. It is not known if this medicine passes into the breast milk. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nBronchitol is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Bronchitol \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \n\nyou are not sure. \n\n \n\nAlways take your bronchodilator before using Bronchitol.  \n\n \n\nHow much to use \n\n \n\nAdults 18 years of age and over \n\n \n\nInitiation dose \n\nBefore you are prescribed Bronchitol your doctor will help you take your first dose of Bronchitol and \n\ntest your lung function at each step to make sure you aren’t sensitive to mannitol.

Bronchitol capsules can only be used with \n\nthe inhaler provided in the pack. \n\n \n\nInhaler device  \n\nThe following steps explain how to use the inhaler. For more advice on how to look after your inhaler, \n\nplease see the end of the instructions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Take off the cap \n\n- Using both hands, hold the inhaler upright \n\nand take off the cap. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Open the inhaler \n\n- Hold the bottom of the inhaler firmly with \n\none hand. \n\n- You should hold the inhaler along the \n\nbottom to make sure you don’t press the \n\npiercing buttons. \n\n- Then open it by turning the mouth-piece in \n\nthe direction of the arrow on the inhaler. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Put in the capsule \n\n- First make sure your hands are dry. \n\n- Then take out a capsule from the blister \n\n(only remove the capsule just before use). \n\n- Put the capsule into the capsule-shaped \n\nspace in the bottom of the inhaler. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Close the inhaler \n\n- Keep the inhaler in an upright position. \n\n- Then twist the mouth-piece into the closed \n\nposition - when it is closed you will hear a \n\n‘click’. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. Make a hole in the capsule  \n\n- This lets the powder in the capsule be \n\nreleased when you breathe in. In this leaflet \n\nwe call making the hole ‘piercing’. \n\n- Hold the inhaler upright and fully press in \n\nboth ‘Piercing’ buttons on the sides of the \n\ninhaler at the same time, then release them. \n\nOnly do this once. This is because piercing \n\nthe capsule more than once may make it split \n\nor break-up. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. Prepare for inhalation \n\n- Tilt the inhaler so that the mouth-piece faces \n\nslightly downward. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n- This allows the capsule to drop forward into the spinning chamber. \n\n- Keep the inhaler tilted in this way and breathe out completely (away from the inhaler). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7. Inhale \n\n- Tilt your head back slightly. \n\n- Keeping the inhaler tilted downward, put the \n\ninhaler to your mouth and make sure you \n\nclose your lips tightly around the \n\nmouth-piece. \n\n- Take a steady deep breath in, to fill your \n\nlungs - then hold your breath for 5 seconds. \n\nWhen you breathe in you should hear a \n\n‘rattling’ sound as the capsule spins in the \n\ninhaler. If this does not happen, the capsule \n\nmay be stuck. \n\n- If you do not hear the rattling, hold the inhaler with the mouth-piece facing downwards, and tap \n\nthe bottom firmly. Do not try to loosen the capsule by pressing the piercing buttons again. \n\nRepeat the inhalation to get your dose. \n\n \n\n8. Breathe out \n\n- Take the inhaler away from your mouth. \n\n- Breathe out, and then breathe normally \n\nagain. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9. Check the capsule \n\n- Look to see if the capsule is empty - the \n\ncapsule must spin in the inhaler in order to \n\nempty. If the capsule has not emptied you \n\nmay need to repeat steps 6 to 8. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10. Take out the used capsule  \n\n- Turn the inhaler upside down, tap the bottom and throw the empty capsule away. \n\n11. Repeat steps 3 to 10 for each capsule  \n\n- Perform these steps for each of the ten capsules.  \n\n- To get the best results from Bronchitol, inhale each capsule one after another. \n\n \n\nExtra information on how to look after your inhaler \n\n- Keep your inhaler dry and always make sure your hands are dry before using it. \n\n- Never breathe or cough into your inhaler. \n\n- Never take your inhaler apart. \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n- Never place a capsule directly into the mouth-piece of your inhaler. \n\n- Never leave a used capsule in your inhaler chamber. \n\n- Use a new inhaler each week. \n\n- If your inhaler breaks, use your second inhaler and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nCleaning the inhaler - Usually your inhaler will give you the correct dose of medicine for 7 days \n\nwithout needing cleaning. However, if your inhaler does need cleaning, the steps to follow are: \n\n1. Ensure your inhaler is empty. \n\n2. Wash your inhaler in warm water with the mouth-piece open.  \n\n3. Shake it until there are no large water droplets left in the inhaler.  \n\n4. Leave it to dry in the air - lay it on its side with the mouth-piece open. \n\n5. You must let it fully dry, this can take up to 24 hours. While it is drying, use your other inhaler. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
