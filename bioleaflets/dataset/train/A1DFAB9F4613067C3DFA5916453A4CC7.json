QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNovoEight 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \nEach powder vial contains nominally 250 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), turoctocog alfa.  \n \nAfter reconstitution NovoEight contains approximately 62.5 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII \n(rDNA), turoctocog alfa.  \n \nNovoEight 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \nEach powder vial contains nominally 500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), turoctocog alfa.  \n \nAfter reconstitution NovoEight contains approximately 125 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII \n(rDNA), turoctocog alfa. \n \nNovoEight 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \nEach powder vial contains nominally 1000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), turoctocog alfa. \n \nAfter reconstitution NovoEight contains approximately 250 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII \n(rDNA), turoctocog alfa. \n \nNovoEight 1500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \nEach powder vial contains nominally 1500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), turoctocog alfa.  \n \nAfter reconstitution NovoEight contains approximately 375 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII \n(rDNA), turoctocog alfa.  \n \nNovoEight 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \nEach powder vial contains nominally 2000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), turoctocog alfa.  \n \nAfter reconstitution NovoEight contains approximately 500 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII \n(rDNA), turoctocog alfa.  \n \nNovoEight 3000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection. \nEach powder vial contains nominally 3000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), turoctocog alfa.  \n \nAfter reconstitution NovoEight contains approximately 750 IU/ml of human coagulation factor VIII \n(rDNA), turoctocog alfa.  \n \nThe potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur) chromogenic assay. The \nspecific activity of NovoEight is approximately 8,300 IU/mg protein. \n \nTuroctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 1,445 amino \nacids with an approximate molecular mass of 166 kDA. It is produced by recombinant DNA \ntechnology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and prepared without the addition of any human or \nanimal derived protein in the cell culture process, purification or final formulation. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTuroctocog alfa is a B-domain truncated recombinant human coagulation factor VIII (B-domain \nconsists of 21 amino acids of the wild type B-domain) without any other modifications in the amino \nacid sequence. \n \nExcipient with known effect  \nThe medicinal product contains 30.5 mg sodium per reconstituted vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nWhite or slightly yellow powder or friable mass.  \n \nClear and colourless solution for injection. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). \n \nNovoEight can be used for all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be under the supervision of a doctor experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. \n \nTreatment monitoring \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the \ndose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. Individual patients may vary in their \nresponse to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight \nmay require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In a single dose pharmacokinetic study \nin adult patients the maximum exposure (Cmax) and the total exposure (AUC) increased with increasing \nbody mass index (BMI) indicating that dose adjustments may be required. An increase in dose may be \nrequired for underweight patients (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) and a decrease in dose may be required for obese \npatients (BMI \u226530 kg/m2), but there is insufficient data to recommend specific dose adjustments, see \nsection 5.2. \n \nIn the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy \nby means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.  \n \nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining \nfactor VIII activity in patients\u2019 blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly \naffected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Also there can \nbe significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based one stage clotting assay \nand the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance particularly when changing the \nlaboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.  \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient\u2019s clinical condition. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \nrelated to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products. The activity of factor VIII in plasma is \nexpressed either as percentage (relative to normal level human plasma) or in International Units \n(relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).  \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \nnormal human plasma.  \n \nOn-demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 \nInternational Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. \nThe required dose is determined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dl) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dl). \n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n \nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the \ngiven plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table \ncan be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \nDegree of haemorrhage/Type of \nsurgical procedure \n\nFVIII level required (%) \n(IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses \n(hours)/Duration of therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage   \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding \nor oral bleeding \n\n \n20\u201340 \n\n \nRepeat every 12 to 24 hours, at \nleast 1 day, until the bleeding \nepisode as indicated by pain is \nresolved or healing achieved \n\n \n \nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma \n\n \n \n30\u201360 \n\n \n \nRepeat infusion every 12\u201324 hours \nfor 3\u20134 days or more until pain and \nacute disability are resolved \n \n\n \nLife threatening haemorrhages \n\n \n60\u2013100 \n\n \nRepeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved \n \n\nSurgery   \nMinor surgery including tooth \nextraction \n \n\n30\u201360 Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \nhealing is achieved \n \n\nMajor surgery 80\u2013100 \n(pre- and postoperative) \n\nRepeat infusion every 8\u201324 hours \nuntil adequate wound healing, then \ntherapy for at least another 7 days \nto maintain a factor VIII activity of \n30% to 60% (IU/dl) \n\n \nProphylaxis \nFor long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A. The usual \nrecommended doses are 20\u201340 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight every second day or 20\u201350 IU of \nfactor VIII per kg body weight 3 times weekly. In adults and adolesents (>12 years) a less frequent \n\n\n\n5 \n\nregimen (40-60 IU/kg every third day or twice weekly) may be applicable. In some cases, especially in \nyounger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.  \n \nSurgery \nThere is limited experience of surgery in paediatric patients. \n \nElderly  \nThere is no experience in patients >65 years.  \n \nPaediatric population \nFor long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients below the age of 12, doses of 25\u201350 IU of \nfactor VIII per kg body weight every second day or 25\u201360 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight \n3 times weekly are recommended. For paediatric patients above the age of 12 the dose \nrecommendations are the same as for adults. \n \nMethod of administration \nIntravenous use.  \n \nThe recommended infusion rate for NovoEight is 1\u20132 ml/min. The rate should be determined by the \npatient\u2019s comfort level. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nKnown allergic reaction to hamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with NovoEight. The product contains traces of \nhamster proteins, which in some patients may cause allergic reactions. If symptoms of hypersensitivity \noccur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact \ntheir physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including \nhives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors  \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per \nml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of \nthe disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 exposure \ndays but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \nposing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.  \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observation and laboratory test. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \n\n\n\n6 \n\ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nCardiovascular event \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitiution therapy with FVIII may increase the \ncardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that NovoEight is administered to a patient, the name and \nbatch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \nof the medicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nThe medicinal product contains 30.5 mg sodium per reconstituted vial, equivalent to 1.5% of the \nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have \nbeen reported. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with NovoEight. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \nbreastfeeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation \nonly if clearly indicated.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNovoEight has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nVery rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has \nbeen observed. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with NovoEight. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \ncentre is contacted. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials  \nSystem Organ Class Frequencya in \n\nPTPs \nFrequencya in \nPUPs \n\nAdverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nUncommonb Very commonb FVIII inhibition  \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon  Insomnia \nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon  Headache, dizziness, burning \nsensation \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon  Sinus tachycardia, acute \nmyocardial infarction \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon  Hypertension, lymphoedema, \nhyperaemia \n\n Common Flushing, Thrombophlebitis \nsuperficial \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders  \n\n Common Rash, rash erythematous \nUncommon  Rash, lichenoid keratosis, skin \n\nburning sensation \nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon   Musculoskeletal stiffness, \narthropathy, pain in extremity, \nmusculoskeletal pain \n\n Common Haemarthrosis, Muscle \nhaemorrhage \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Common Cough  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nCommon   Injection site reactionsc \n Common Pyrexia, catheter site erythema \nUncommon   Fatigue, feeling hot, oedema \n\nperipheral, pyrexia \nInvestigations Common  Hepatic enzymes increasedd \n\n Common Anti factor VIII antibody \npositive \n\nUncommon   Heart rate increased  \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Common Vomiting \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\nCommon  Incorrect dose administered \n Common Infusion related reaction \nUncommon   Contusion \n\nProduct issues  Common Thrombosis in device \na Calculated based on total number of unique patients in all clinical trials (301), of which 242 \n\nwere previously treated patients (PTPs) and 60 were previously untreated patients (PUPs).  \nb Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A.  \nc Injection site reactions include injection site erythema, injection site extravasation and injection \n\nsite pruritus. \nd Hepatic enzymes increased include alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, \n\ngamma-glutamyltransferase and bilirubin. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nDuring all clinical studies with NovoEight in previously treated patients, a total of 35 adverse \nreactions were reported in 23 of 242 patients exposed to NovoEight. The most frequently reported \nadverse reactions were injection site reactions, incorrect dose administered and hepatic enzymes \nincreased. Of the 35 adverse reactions, 2 were reported in 1 out of 31 patients below 6 years of age, \nnone in patients from 6 to \u226412 years of age, 1 event in 1 out of 24 patients (12 to <18 years of age) and \n32 were reported in 21 out of 155 adults (\u226518 years). \n \nPaediatric population \nIn clinical trials involving 63 previously treated paediatric patients between 0 and 12 years of age and \n24 adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age with severe haemophilia A no difference in the safety \nprofile of NovoEight was observed between paediatric patients and adults. \n \nIn the trial with previously untreated patients, between 0 and 6 years of age, a total of 46 adverse \nreactions were reported in 33 of 60 patients exposed to NovoEight. The most frequently reported \nadverse reaction was Factor VIII inhibition, see section 4.4. High risk genetic mutations were \nidentified in 92.3% of the overall and 93.8% of the high titre confirmed inhibitors. No other factors \nwere significantly associated with inhibitor development.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nMechanism of action \nNovoEight contains turoctocog alfa, a human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), with a truncated B-\ndomain. This glycoprotein has the same structure as human factor VIII when activated, and post-\ntranslational modifications that are similar to those of the plasma-derived molecule. The tyrosine \nsulphation site present at Tyr1680 (native full length), which is important for the binding to von \nWillebrand factor, has been found to be fully sulphated in the turoctocog alfa molecule. When infused \ninto a haemophilia patient, factor VIII binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient\u2019s \ncirculation. The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and \nvon Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. Activated factor VIII acts as a co-factor \nfor activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor \nX converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be \nformed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased \nlevels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels \nof factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and \ncorrection of bleeding tendencies.  \n \nOf note, annualised bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and \nbetween different clinical studies. \n \nClinical efficacy \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nFour multi-centre, open-labelled, non-controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety and \nefficacy of NovoEight in the prevention and treatment of bleeds and during surgery in patients with \nsevere haemophilia A (FVIII activity \u22641%). Three of these trials were performed in previously treated \npatients and the fourth in previously untreated patients. The trials included 298 exposed patients; 175 \nadolescents or adult patients without inhibitors from the age of 12 years (\u2265150 exposure days), 63 \npreviously treated paediatric patients without inhibitors below 12 years of age (\u226550 exposure days) \nand 60 previously untreated patients below 6 years of age.  \n188 out of 238 previously treated patients continued into the safety extension trial. Treatment with \nNovoEight was shown to be safe and had the intended haemostatic and preventive effect.  \nOf the 3,293 reported bleeds observed in 298 of the patients, 2,902 (88.1%) of the bleeds were \nresolved with 1-2 infusions of NovoEight. \n \nTable 3 Consumption of NovoEight and haemostatic success rates in previously untreated \npatients (PUP) and previously treated patients (PTP) \n Younger \n\nchildren \n(0 \u2013 \n<6 years) \nPUP \n\nYounger \nchildren \n(0 \u2013 \n<6 years) \nPTP \n\nOlder \nchildren \n(6 \u2013 \n<12 years) \nPTP \n\nAdolescents \n(12 \u2013 \n<18 years) \nPTP \n\nAdults \n(\u226518 years) \nPTP \n\nTotal \n\nNumber of \npatients \n\n60 31 32 24 151 298 \n\nDose used for \nprevention \nper patient \n(IU/kg BW)  \nMean (SD) \nMin ; Max \n\n \n \n \n \n45.2 (14.4) \n4.5 ; 363.8 \n\n \n \n \n \n41.5 (8.1) \n3.4 ; 196.3. \n\n \n \n \n \n38.4 (9.4) \n3.2 ; 62.5 \n\n \n \n \n \n28.5 (9.3) \n17.4 ; 73.9 \n\n \n \n \n \n28.5 (8.3) \n12.0 ; 97.4 \n\n \n \n \n \n32.8 (10.9) \n3.2 ; 363.8 \n\nDose used for \ntreatment of \nbleed (IU/kg \nBW) \nMean (SD) \nMin ; Max \n\n \n \n \n43.6 (15.2) \n11.9 ; 118.9 \n\n \n \n \n44.0 (12.6) \n21.4 ; 193.8 \n\n \n \n \n40.4 (10.5) \n24.0 ; 71.4 \n\n \n \n \n29.3 (10.3) \n12.4 ; 76.8 \n\n \n \n \n35.0 (12.3) \n6.4 ; 104.0 \n\n \n \n \n37.5 (13.4) \n6.4 ; 193.8 \n\nSuccess ratea \n% \n\n87.0% 92.2% \n \n\n88.4% \n \n\n85.1% \n \n\n89.6% \n \n\n88.9% \n \n\nBW: Body weight, SD: Standard deviation \na Success is defined as either 'Excellent' or 'Good'. \n \nA total of 30 surgeries were performed in 25 patients of which 26 were major surgeries and 4 were \nminor. Haemostasis was successful in all surgeries and no treatment failures were reported. \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) has been collected in patients with haemophilia A who had \ndeveloped inhibitors to factor VIII. During clinical trial in PUPs, 21 patients were treated with ITI and \n18 (86%) patients completed ITI with a negative inhibitor test result.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with NovoEight were conducted after i.v. administration of 50 IU/kg \nNovoEight in previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A (FVIII \u22641%). The analysis of \nplasma samples was conducted using both the one-stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay.  \nThe assay performance of NovoEight in FVIII:C assays was evaluated and compared to a marketed \nfull length recombinant FVIII product. The study showed that comparable and consistent results were \nobtained for both products and that NovoEight can be reliably measured in plasma without the need of \na separate NovoEight standard. \n \nThe single dose pharmacokinetic parameters of NovoEight are listed in Table 4 for the one-stage \nclotting assay and in Table 5 for the chromogenic assay.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nTable 4 Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of NovoEight (50 IU/kg) by age - one stage \nclotting assay - Mean (SD) \nParameter  0 \u2212 <6 years 6 \u2212 <12 years \u226512 years  \n\nn=14 n=14 n=33 \nIncremental recovery \n(IU/dl)/(IU/kg) \n\n1.8 (0.7)  2.0 (0.4) 2.2 (0.4) \n\nAUC ((IU*h)/dl) 992 (411)  1109(374) 1526 (577) \nCL (ml/h/kg) 6.21 (3.66) 5.02 (1.68) 3.63 (1.09) \nt\u00bd (h) 7.65 (1.84)  8.02 (1.89) 11.00 (4.65) \nVss (ml/kg) 56.68 (26.43)  46.82 (10.63) 47.40 (9.21) \nCmax (IU/dl) 100 (58)  107 (35) 123 (41) \nMean residence time \n(h) \n\n9.63 (2.50)  9.91 (2.57) 14.19 (5.08) \n\nAbbreviations: AUC = area under the factor VIII activity time profile; CL = clearance; t1/2 = terminal \nhalf-life; Vss = volume of distribution at steady-state; Cmax = maximum factor VIII activity. \n \nTable 5 Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of NovoEight (50 IU/kg) by age - chromogenic \nassay - Mean (SD) \nParameter 0 \u2212 <6 years 6 \u2212 <12 years \u226512 years  \n\nn=14 n=14 n=33 \nIncremental recovery \n(IU/dl)/(IU/kg) \n\n2.2 (0.6) 2.5 (0.6) 2.9 (0.6) \n\nAUC ((IU*h)/dl) 1223 (436) 1437 (348) 1963 (773) \nCL (ml/h/kg) 4.59 (1.73) 3.70 (1.00) 2.86 (0.94) \nt\u00bd (h) 9.99 (1.71) 9.42 (1.52) 11.22 (6.86) \nVss (ml/kg) 55.46 (23.53) 41.23 (6.00) 38.18 (10.24) \nCmax (IU/dl) 112 (31) 125 (27) 163 (50) \nMean residence time \n(h) \n\n12.06 (1.90) 11.61 (2.32) 14.54 (5.77) \n\nAbbreviations: AUC = area under the factor VIII activity time profile; CL = clearance; t1/2 = terminal \nhalf-life; Vss = volume of distribution at steady-state; Cmax = maximum factor VIII activity. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable between paediatric patients below 6 years of age \nand the paediatric patients from 6 to below 12 years of age. Some variation was observed in the \npharmacokinetic parameters of NovoEight between paediatric and adult patients. The higher CL and \nthe shorter t\u00bd seen in paediatric patients compared to adult patients with haemophilia A may be due in \npart to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients. \n \nA single dose pharmacokinetic trial (50 IU/kg) was performed in 35 haemophilia patients (\u226518 years \nof age) in different BMI categories. The maximum exposure (Cmax) and the total exposure (AUC) \nincrease with increasing BMI indicating that dose adjustments may be required for underweight (BMI \n<18.5 kg/m2) and obese patients (BMI \u226530 kg/m2), see section 4.2.  \n \nTable 6 Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of NovoEight (50 IU/kg) by BMI classesa \u2013 \nOne-stage clotting assay - Mean (SD) \nPK parameter Underweight \n\nN=5 \nNormal weight \nN=7 \n\nOverweight \nN=8 \n\nObese class I \nN=7 \n\nObese class II/III \nN=7 \n\nIncremental \nrecovery \n(IU/dl)/(IU/kg) \n\n1.7 (0.2) 2.0 (0.2) 2.4 (0.4) 2.3 (0.3)b 2.6 (0.3) \n\nAUC ((IU*h)/dl) 1510 (360) 1920 (610) 1730 (610) 2030 (840) 2350 (590) \nCL (ml/h/kg) 3.91 (0.94) 3.20 (1.00) 3.63 (1.24) 3.37 (1.79) 2.51 (0.63) \nt\u00bd (h) 11.3 (2.0) 11.7 (3.5) 9.4 (2.9) 11.2 (3.5) 11.1 (2.7) \n\n\n\n11 \n\nVss (ml/kg) 56.8 (5.4) 44.8 (6.5) 39.6 (6.0) 42.0 (9.0) 35.0 (4.6) \nCmax (IU/dl) 100 (11) 121 (10) 144 (26) 140 (21) 161 (32) \nMean residence \ntime (h) \n\n15.1 (3.0) 15.3 (4.8) 11.9 (3.7) 14.4 (4.6) 14.6 (3.7) \n\na BMI groups: Underweight: BMI <18.5 kg/m2, Normal weight: BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, Overweight: \nBMI 25-29.9 kg/m2, Obese class I: BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2, Obese class II/III: BMI \u226535 kg/m2. \nb Based on 6 patients only. \n \nTable 7 Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of NovoEight (50 IU/kg) by BMI classesa \u2013 \nChromogenic assay - Mean (SD) \nPK parameter Underweight \n\nN=5 \nNormal weight \nN=7 \n\nOverweight \nN=9 \n\nObese class I \nN=7 \n\nObese class \nII/III N=7 \n\nIncremental \nrecovery \n(IU/dl)/(IU/kg) \n\n2.2 (0.4) 2.9 (0.3) 3.0 (0.5) 3.2 (0.5) 3.5 (0.5) \n\nAUC ((IU*h)/dl) 1860 (700) 2730 (860) 2310 (1020) 2780 (1210) 3050 (730) \nCL (ml/h/kg) 3.28 (0.87) 2.25 (0.73) 2.84 (1.09) 2.58 (1.56) 1.94 (0.52) \nt\u00bd (h) 11.7 (2.4) 11.5 (3.6) 9.7 (3.4) 10.4 (3.2) 10.5 (2.5) \nVss (ml/kg) 49.1 (10.4) 31.2 (4.5) 31.6 (5.8) 28.9 (5.1) 25.7 (4.0) \nCmax (IU/dl) 138 (29) 185 (24) 194 (31) 200 (33) 227 (32) \nMean residence \ntime (h) \n\n15.5 (3.2) 15.2 (4.9) 12.6 (4.8) 13.5 (4.6) 13.9 (3.7) \n\na BMI groups: Underweight: BMI <18.5 kg/m2, Normal weight: BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, Overweight: \nBMI 25-29.9 kg/m2, Obese class I: BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2, Obese class II/III: BMI \u226535 kg/m2. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special concern for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and repeated dose toxicity. \n \n \n6.

After reconstitution the solution appears as a clear or slightly opalescent \nsolution. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nYou will also need an infusion set (tubing and butterfly needle), sterile alcohol swabs, gauze pads and \nplasters. These devices are not included in the NovoEight package.  \n \nAlways use an aseptic technique.  \n \nReconstitution \n \nA) \nTake the vial, the vial adapter and the pre-filled \nsyringe out of the carton. Leave the plunger rod \nuntouched in the carton. Bring the vial and the \npre-filled syringe to room temperature. You can \ndo this by holding them in your hands until they \nfeel as warm as your hands. Do not use any \nother way to heat the vial and pre-filled syringe. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n A \n\n \n \n\nB) \nRemove the plastic cap from the vial. If the \nplastic cap is loose or missing, do not use the \nvial. Wipe the rubber stopper on the vial with a \nsterile alcohol swab and allow it to air dry for a \nfew seconds before use. \n\n \n\n \n\n B \n\n \n \n\nC) \nRemove the protective paper from the vial \nadapter. If the protective paper is not fully \nsealed or if it is broken, do not use the vial \nadapter. \nDo not take the vial adapter out of the protective \ncap with your fingers.  \n\n \n\n \n\n C \n\n \n \n\nD) \nTurn over the protective cap and snap the vial \nadapter onto the vial. Once attached do not \nremove the vial adapter from the vial. \n\n \n\n \n\n D \n\n \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nE) \nLightly squeeze the protective cap with your \nthumb and index finger as shown. Remove the \nprotective cap from the vial adapter. \n\n \n E \n\n \n \n\nF) \nGrasp the plunger rod by the wide top and \nimmediately connect the plunger rod to the \nsyringe by turning it clockwise into the plunger \ninside the pre-filled syringe until resistance is \nfelt. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n F \n\n \n \n\nG) \nRemove the syringe cap from the pre-filled \nsyringe by bending it down until the perforation \nbreaks. Do not touch the syringe tip under the \nsyringe cap. \n\n \n\n \n\n G \n\n \n \n\nH) \nScrew the pre-filled syringe securely onto the \nvial adapter until resistance is felt. \n\n \n\n \n\n H \n\n \n \n\nI) \nHold the pre-filled syringe slightly tilted with \nthe vial pointing downwards. Push the plunger \nrod to inject all the solvent into the vial. \n\n \n\n \n\n I \n\n \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nJ) \nKeep the plunger rod pressed down and swirl \nthe vial gently until all the powder is dissolved. \nDo not shake the vial as this will cause foaming.  \n\n \n\n \n\n J \n\n \n \n\n \nIt is recommended to use NovoEight immediately after reconstitution. For storage conditions of the \nreconstituted medicinal product see section 6.3. \n \nIf a larger dose is needed, repeat steps A to J with additional vials, vial adapters and pre-filled \nsyringes. \n \nAdministration of the reconstituted solution \n \nK) \nKeep the plunger rod pushed completely in. \nTurn the syringe with the vial upside down. Stop \npushing the plunger rod and let it move back on \nits own while the reconstituted solution fills the \nsyringe. Pull the plunger rod slightly downwards \nto draw the reconstituted solution into the \nsyringe. \n \nIn case you only need part of the entire vial, use \nthe scale on the syringe to see how much \nreconstituted solution you withdraw, as \ninstructed by your doctor or nurse. \n \nWhile holding the vial upside down, tap the \nsyringe gently to let any air bubbles rise to the \ntop. Push the plunger rod slowly until all air \nbubbles are gone. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n K \n\n \n \n\nL) \nUnscrew the vial adapter with the vial.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNovoEight is now ready for injection. Locate a \nsuitable site and slowly inject NovoEight into \nthe vein over a period of 2-5 minutes. \n\n \n\n \n\n L \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nDisposal \nAfter injection, safely dispose of all unused NovoEight solution, the syringe with the infusion set, the \nvial with the vial adapter and other waste materials as instructed by your pharmacist.  \n \nDo not throw it out with the ordinary household waste.  \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again.  \n\u2013 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n\u2013 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2013 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What NovoEight is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoEight  \n3. How to use NovoEight  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store NovoEight  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NovoEight is and what it is used for \n \nNovoEight contains the active substance turoctocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII. Factor VIII is \na protein naturally found in the blood that helps it to clot. \n \nNovoEight is used to treat and prevent bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A (inborn factor \nVIII deficiency) and can be used for all age groups. \n \nIn patients with haemophilia A, factor VIII is missing or not working properly. NovoEight replaces \nthis faulty or missing \u2018factor VIII\u2019 and helps blood to form clots at the site of bleeding. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoEight \n \nDo not use NovoEight: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to the active substance or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n\u2022 if you are allergic to hamster proteins. \n \nDo not use NovoEight if either of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor \nbefore using this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before using NovoEight. \n \nThere is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \nreaction) to NovoEight. Early signs of allergic reactions are rash, hives, weals, generalised itching, \n\n\n\n48 \n\nswelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness of the chest, general feeling of \nbeing unwell, and dizziness. \n \nIf any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor.  \n \nTalk to your doctor if you think that your bleed is not being controlled with the dose you receive, as \nthere can be several reasons for this. Some people using this medicine can develop antibodies to factor \nVIII (also known as factor VIII inhibitors). Factor VIII inhibitors make NovoEight less effective in \npreventing or controlling bleeding. If this happens you may need a higher dose of NovoEight or a \ndifferent medicine to control your bleed. Do not increase the total dose of NovoEight to control your \nbleed without talking to your doctor. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously treated \nwith factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher risk that \nit happens again. \n \nThe formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \nall Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \nyou or your child\u00b4s bleeding is not being controlled with NovoEight, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nOther medicines and NovoEight \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \nPregnancy and breastfeeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNovoEight has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nNovoEight contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 30.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per reconstituted vial.  \nThis is equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoEight \n \nTreatment with NovoEight will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor \nif you are not sure. \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose for you. This will depend on your weight and what the medicine \nis being used for.  \n \nPrevention of bleeding \nThe usual dose of NovoEight is 20 to 50 international units (IU) per kg of body weight. The injection \nis given every 2 to 3 days. In some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or \nhigher doses may be needed. \n \nTreatment of bleeding \nThe dose of NovoEight is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nNovoEight can be used in children of all ages. In children (below the age of 12) higher doses or more \nfrequent injections may be needed. Adolescents (above the age of 12) can use the same dose as adults. \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \nHow NovoEight is given \nNovoEight is given as an injection into a vein. See \u2018Instructions on how to use NovoEight\u2019 for more \ninformation. \n \nIf you use more NovoEight than you should \nIf you use more NovoEight than you should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. \n \nIf you forget to use NovoEight \nYou should contact your doctor if you have missed a dose and do not know how to compensate for \nthis.  \n \nIf you stop using NovoEight \nIf you stop using NovoEight you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may \nnot stop. Do not stop using NovoEight without talking to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may occur with this medicine. \n \nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic reactions) occur (very rare), the injection must be \nstopped immediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have one of the following \nearly symptoms: \n \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath or wheezing \n\u2022 chest tightness \n\u2022 swelling of the lips and tongue \n\u2022 rash, hives, weals or generalised itching \n\u2022 feeling dizzy or loss of consciousness \n\u2022 low blood pressure (having pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat). \n \nSevere symptoms, including difficulty in swallowing or breathing and red or swollen face or hands, \nrequire prompt emergency treatment. \n \nIf you have a severe allergic reaction, your doctor may change your medicine.  \n \nFor children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) \nmay form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients); however patients who have received previous \ntreatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 \npatients). If this happens to you or your child\u00b4s medicines may stop working properly and you or your \nchild may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 blood tests showing changes in the way the liver functions \n\u2022 reactions (redness and itching) around the site where you injected the medicine. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in patients who have not previously \ntreated with Factor VIII medicines \n\u2022 blushing of the skin \n\u2022 inflammation of vein \n\u2022 bleeding into joint spaces \n\u2022 bleeding in muscle tissue \n\u2022 cough \n\n\n\n50 \n\n\u2022 redness around the site where you placed catheter \n\u2022 vomiting. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 feeling tired \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 feeling dizzy \n\u2022 difficulty sleeping (insomnia) \n\u2022 fast heartbeat \n\u2022 increased blood pressure \n\u2022 rash \n\u2022 fever \n\u2022 feeling hot \n\u2022 stiffness of muscles \n\u2022 pain in muscles \n\u2022 pain in legs and arms \n\u2022 swelling of legs and feet \n\u2022 joint disease \n\u2022 bruising \n\u2022 heart attack. \n \nSide effects in children and adolescents \nThe side effects observed in children and adolescents are the same as observed in adults. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.

Attach the plunger rod and the syringe \n \n\u2022 Grasp the plunger rod by the wide top \n\nend and take it out of the carton. Do \nnot touch the sides or the thread of \nthe plunger rod. If you touch the \nsides or the thread, germs from your \nfingers can be transferred. \n\n \n\u2022 Immediately connect the plunger rod \n\nto the syringe by turning it clockwise \n\n \n \n\n \n\n F \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\ninto the plunger inside the pre-filled \nsyringe until resistance is felt. \n\n\u2022 Remove the syringe cap from the pre-\nfilled syringe by bending it down until \nthe perforation breaks. \n\n \n\u2022 Do not touch the syringe tip under \n\nthe syringe cap. If you touch the \nsyringe tip, germs from your fingers \ncan be transferred. \n\n \nIf the syringe cap is loose or missing, \ndo not use the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\n G \n\n \n\n\u2022 Screw the pre-filled syringe securely \nonto the vial adapter until resistance is \nfelt. \n\n \n\n H \n\n \n \n\n4. Reconstitute the powder with the \nsolvent \n \n\u2022 Hold the pre-filled syringe slightly \n\ntilted with the vial pointing \ndownwards. \n\n \n\u2022 Push the plunger rod to inject all the \n\nsolvent into the vial. \n\n \n\n I \n\n \n\n\u2022 Keep the plunger rod pressed down \nand swirl the vial gently until all the \npowder is dissolved. \n \nDo not shake the vial as this will \ncause foaming. \n \n\n\u2022 Check the reconstituted solution. It \nmust be clear to slightly opalescent \n(slightly unclear). If you notice visible \nparticles or discolouration, do not \nuse it. Use a new package instead. \n\n \n\n J \n\n \nNovoEight is recommended to be used immediately after it has been reconstituted. This is \nbecause if left, the medicine may no longer be sterile and could cause infections. \n \nIf you cannot use the reconstituted NovoEight solution immediately, it should be used within \n4 hours when stored at room temperature or up to 40\u00b0C and within 24 hours when stored at 2\u00b0C \u2013 \n8\u00b0C. Store the reconstituted product in the vial. \n \nDo not freeze reconstituted NovoEight solution or store it in syringes. \nDo not store the solution without your doctor\u2019s advice. \n \nKeep reconstituted NovoEight solution out of direct light. \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \nIf your dose requires more than one vial, repeat steps A to J with additional vials, vial adapters and \npre-filled syringes until you have reached your required dose. \n \n\u2022 Keep the plunger rod pushed \n\ncompletely in. \n \n\u2022 Turn the syringe with the vial upside \n\ndown. \n \n\u2022 Stop pushing the plunger rod and let \n\nit move back on its own while the \nreconstituted solution fills the syringe. \n\n \n\u2022 Pull the plunger rod slightly \n\ndownwards to draw the reconstituted \nsolution into the syringe. \n\n \n\u2022 In case you only need part of the \n\nentire vial, use the scale on the \nsyringe to see how much \nreconstituted solution you withdraw, \nas instructed by your doctor or \nnurse. \n \nIf, at any point, there is too much air in \nthe syringe, inject the air back into the \nvial. \n\n \n\u2022 While holding the vial upside down, \n\ntap the syringe gently to let any air \nbubbles rise to the top. \n\n \n\u2022 Push the plunger rod slowly until all \n\nair bubbles are gone. \n \n \n\n \n\n K \n\n \n\n\u2022 Unscrew the vial adapter with the \nvial. \n\n \n\u2022 Do not touch the syringe tip. If you \n\ntouch the syringe tip, germs from your \nfingers can be transferred. \n\n \n\n \n\n L \n\n \n5. Inject the reconstituted solution \n \nNovoEight is now ready to be injected into your vein. \n \n\u2022 Inject the reconstituted solution as instructed by your doctor or nurse. \n \n\u2022 Inject slowly over 2 to 5 minutes. \n \n\u2022 Do not mix NovoEight with any other intravenous infusions or medicines. \n \nInjecting NovoEight via needleless connectors for intravenous (IV) catheters  \n \nCaution: The pre-filled syringe is made of glass and is designed to be compatible with standard \n\n\n\n57 \n\nluer-lock connections. Some needleless connectors with an internal spike are incompatible with the \npre-filled syringe. This incompatibility may prevent administration of the medicine and/or result in \ndamage to the needleless connector. \n \nInjecting the solution via a central venous access device (CVAD) such as a central venous catheter \nor a subcutaneous port: \n\u2022 Use a clean and germ free (aseptic) technique. Follow the instructions for proper use for your \nconnector and CVAD in consultation with your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 Injecting into a CVAD may require using a sterile 10 ml plastic syringe for withdrawal of the \nreconstituted solution. This should be done right after step J. \n\u2022 If the CVAD line needs to be flushed before or after NovoEight injection, use sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml solution for injection. \n \n \nDisposal \n \n\u2022 After injection, safely dispose of all \n\nunused NovoEight solution, the \nsyringe with the infusion set, the vial \nwith the vial adapter and other waste \nmaterials as instructed by your \npharmacist. \n \nDo not throw it out with the ordinary \nhousehold waste. \n\n \n\n \n\n M \n\n \n\n \nDo not disassemble the equipment before disposal.  \n \nDo not reuse the equipment. \n\n \n\n\n\tANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
