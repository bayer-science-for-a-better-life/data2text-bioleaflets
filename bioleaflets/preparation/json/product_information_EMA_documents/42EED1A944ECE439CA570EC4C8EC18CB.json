PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for infusion. \n \nWhite crystalline powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreosulfan in combination with fludarabine is indicated as part of conditioning treatment prior to \nallogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in adult patients with malignant and \nnon-malignant diseases, and in paediatric patients older than one month with malignant diseases. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAdministration of treosulfan should be supervised by a physician experienced in conditioning \ntreatment followed by alloHSCT. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults with malignant disease \n \nTreosulfan is given in combination with fludarabine. \nThe recommended dose and schedule of administration is: \n• Treosulfan 10 g/m² body surface area (BSA) per day as a two-hour intravenous infusion, given \n\non three consecutive days (day -4, -3, -2) before stem cell infusion (day 0). The total treosulfan \ndose is 30 g/m²; \n\n• Fludarabine 30 mg/m² BSA per day as a 0.5-hour intravenous infusion, given on five \nconsecutive days (day -6, -5, -4, -3, -2) before stem cell infusion (day 0). The total fludarabine \ndose is 150 mg/m²; \n\n• Treosulfan should be administered before fludarabine on days -4, -3, -2 (FT10 regimen). \n \nAdults with non-malignant disease \n \nTreosulfan is given in combination with fludarabine with or without thiotepa.  \nThe recommended dose and schedule of administration is: \n\n\n\n3 \n\n• Treosulfan 14 g/m² body surface area (BSA) per day as a two-hour intravenous infusion, given \non three consecutive days (day -6, -5, -4) before stem cell infusion (day 0). The total treosulfan \ndose is 42 g/m²; \n\n• Fludarabine 30 mg/m² BSA per day as a 0.5-hour intravenous infusion, given on five \nconsecutive days (day -7, -6, -5, -4, -3) before stem cell infusion (day 0). The total fludarabine \ndose is 150 mg/m²; \n\n• Treosulfan should be administered before fludarabine on days -6, -5, -4 (FT14 regimen). \n• Thiotepa 5 mg/kg twice a day, given as two intravenous infusions over 2–4 hours on day -2 \n\nbefore stem cell infusion (day 0). \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in any subset of the elderly population. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for mild or moderate impairment, but treosulfan is contraindicated in \npatients with severe impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nTreosulfan is given in combination with fludarabine, with thiotepa (intensified regimen; \nFT10-14TT regimen) or without thiotepa (FT10-14 regimen).  \nThe recommended dose and schedule of administration is: \n• Treosulfan 10-14 g/m² body surface area (BSA) per day as a two-hour intravenous infusion, \n\ngiven on three consecutive days (day -6, -5, -4) before stem cell infusion (day 0). The total \ntreosulfan dose is 30-42 g/m²; \nThe dose of treosulfan should be adapted to the patient’s BSA as follows (see section 5.2): \n\n \nBody surface area (m²) Treosulfan dose (g/m²) \n≤ 0.5 10.0 \n> 0.5 – 1.0 12.0 \n> 1.0 14.0 \n\n \n• Fludarabine 30 mg/m² BSA per day as a 0.5-hour intravenous infusion, given on five \n\nconsecutive days (day -7, -6, -5, -4, -3) before stem cell infusion (day 0). The total fludarabine \ndose is 150 mg/m²; \n\n• Treosulfan should be administered before fludarabine; \n• Thiotepa (intensified regimen 5 mg/kg twice a day), given as two intravenous infusions over 2–\n\n4 hours on day -2 before stem cell infusion (day 0). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of treosulfan in children less than 1 month of age has not yet been established. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTreosulfan is for intravenous use as a two-hour infusion. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n \nWhen handling treosulfan, inhalation, skin contact or contact with mucous membranes should be \navoided. Pregnant personnel should be excluded from handling cytotoxics. \n \nIntravenous administration should be performed using a safe technique to avoid extravasation (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance \n• Active non-controlled infectious disease \n• Severe concomitant cardiac, lung, liver, and renal impairment \n• Fanconi anaemia and other DNA breakage repair disorders \n• Pregnancy (see section 4.6) \n• Administration of live vaccine \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMyelosuppression \n \nProfound myelosuppression with pancytopenia is the desired therapeutic effect of treosulfan-based \nconditioning treatment, occurring in all patients. It is therefore recommended to monitor blood cell \ncounts frequently until recovery of the haematopoietic system.  \nDuring phases of severe neutropenia (median duration of neutropenic period is 14-17.5 days in adults \nand 21-24 days in paediatric patients) the risk of infection is increased. Prophylactic or empiric \nanti-infective treatment (bacterial, viral, fungal) should therefore be considered. Growth factors \n(G-CSF, GM-CSF), platelet and/or red blood cell support should be given as indicated. \n \nSecondary malignancies \n \nSecondary malignancies are well-established complications in long-term survivors after alloHSCT. \nHow much treosulfan contributes to their occurrence is unknown. The possible risk of a second \nmalignancy should be explained to the patient. On the basis of human data, treosulfan has been \nclassified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a human carcinogen. \n \nMucositis \n \nOral mucositis (including high-grade severity) is a very common undesirable effect of \ntreosulfan-based conditioning followed by alloHSCT (see section 4.8). Use of mucositis prophylaxis \n(e.g. topical antimicrobials, barrier protectants, ice and adequate oral hygiene) is recommended. \n \nVaccines \n \nConcomitant use of live attenuated vaccines is not recommended. \n \nFertility \n \nTreosulfan can impair fertility. Therefore, men treated with treosulfan are advised not to father a child \nduring and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on cryo-conservation of sperm prior to \ntreatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with treosulfan. \nOvarian suppression and amenorrhoea with menopausal symptoms commonly occur in \npre-menopausal patients (see section 4.6). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSeizures \n \nThere have been isolated reports of seizures in infants (≤ 4 months of age) with primary \nimmunodeficiencies after conditioning treatment with treosulfan in combination with fludarabine or \ncyclophosphamide. Therefore, infants ≤ 4 months of age should be monitored for signs of neurological \nadverse reactions. Although it cannot be proved that treosulfan was the cause, the use of clonazepam \nprophylaxis for children younger than 1 year might be considered. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nThere was a significant association between age and respiratory toxicity in paediatric patients treated \nwith treosulfan-based conditioning. \nChildren younger than one year (mainly non-malignant diseases, especially immunodeficiencies) \nexperienced more respiratory grade III/IV toxicity, possibly due to pulmonary infections already \nexisting before the start of conditioning treatment. \n \nDermatitis diaper \n \nDermatitis diaper may occur in small children because of excretion of treosulfan in the urine. \nTherefore, nappies should be changed frequently up to 6–8 hours after each infusion of treosulfan.  \n \nExtravasation \n \nTreosulfan is considered an irritant. Intravenous application should be performed using a safe \ntechnique. If extravasation is suspected, general safety measures should be implemented. No specific \nmeasure has been proven to be recommendable. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction of treosulfan was observed in high-dose chemotherapy. \n \nDetailed in vitro studies did not completely exclude potential interactions between high plasma \nconcentrations of treosulfan and CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or P-gp substrates. Therefore, medicinal \nproducts with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. digoxin) that are substrates for CYP3A4, CYP2C19 or \nP-gp should not be given during treatment with treosulfan. \n \nThe effect of treosulfan on the pharmacokinetics of fludarabine is not known. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nBoth sexually active men and women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception \nduring and up to 6 months after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of treosulfan in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with \nrespect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Treosulfan is contraindicated during pregnancy (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether treosulfan is excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued \nduring treatment with treosulfan. \n \nFertility \n \nTreosulfan might impair fertility in men and women. Men should seek advice on cryo-conservation of \nsperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility.  \n \nAs known for other alkylating conditioning agents treosulfan can cause ovarian suppression and \namenorrhoea with menopausal symptoms in pre-menopausal women. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTreosulfan has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. It is likely that certain \nadverse reactions of treosulfan like nausea, vomiting or dizziness could affect these functions.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nProfound myelosuppression/pancytopenia is the desired therapeutic effect of conditioning therapy and \noccurs in all patients. Blood cell counts usually recover after HSCT. \n \nThe most commonly observed adverse reactions (adults/paediatric patients) after treosulfan-based \nconditioning followed by alloHSCT include infections (13.1% /11.4%), gastrointestinal disorders \n(nausea [39.5%/30.7%], stomatitis [36.0%/69.3%], vomiting [22.5%/43.2%], diarrhoea \n[15.6%/33.0%], abdominal pain [10.4%/17%]), fatigue (15.1%/2.3%), febrile neutropenia \n(11.3%/1.1%), oedema (7.8%/0%), rash (7.2%/12.5%), and increases of alanine transaminase (ALT \n[5.1%/9.1%]), aspartate transaminase (AST [4.4%/8.0%]), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γGT \n[3.7%/2.3%]), and bilirubin (18.8%/5.7%). \n \nAdults \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequencies of adverse reactions reported in the table below are derived from 5 clinical trials \n(including a total of 564 patients) where treosulfan combined with fludarabine was investigated as \nconditioning treatment prior to alloHSCT in adult patients. Treosulfan was administered in a dose \nrange of 10-14 g/m² BSA on 3 consecutive days.  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

\n\n\n\n10 \n\nInfections \n \nThe overall incidence of infections was 13.1% (74/564). The most frequent type was lung infection \n(12/74 [16.2%]). Pathogens included bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium), \nviruses (e.g. cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], herpes) as well as fungi (e.g. \ncandida). The infection rate was lowest in patients treated with the dose regimen of 10 g/m² of \ntreosulfan per day, from day -4 to -2 (7.7%). \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \n \nOne of 564 adult patients (0.2%) developed a second malignancy (breast cancer). A few further cases \nof second malignancies after treosulfan-based conditioning have been reported by other investigators. \nAfter long-term therapy with conventional doses of oral treosulfan in patients with solid tumours acute \nmyeloid leukaemia was observed in 1.4% of 553 patients. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n \nBlood disorders were observed in 67 of 564 adult patients (11.9%). The most frequent adverse reaction \nwas febrile neutropenia (11.3%). The lowest incidence was noted with the dose regimen of \n10 g/m²/day, day -4 to -2 (4.1%). \nThe median (25%/75% percentiles) duration of neutropenia was 14 (12, 20) days with the 10 g/m² \ntreosulfan dose and 17.5 (14, 21) days with the 14 g/m² treosulfan dose. \n \nCardiac disorders \n \nCardiac disorders were observed in 25 patients (4.4%). The most frequent adverse reactions were \ncardiac arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation (1.2%), sinus tachycardia (0.9%), supraventricular \ntachycardia (0.4%), and ventricular extrasystole (0.4%). Isolated cases of cardiac arrest, cardiac \nfailure, and myocardial infarction occurred. The lowest frequency of cardiac disorders was seen with \nthe dose regimen of 10 g/m²/day, day -4 to -2 (2.7%). \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nGastrointestinal disorders were observed in 357 patients (63.3%). The most frequent adverse reactions \nreported were nausea (39.5%), stomatitis (36%), vomiting (22.5%), diarrhoea (15.6%), and abdominal \npain (10.4%). The lowest frequencies of these adverse reactions were seen with the dose regimen of \n10 g/m² per day, day -4 to -2 (20.4%, 30.3%, 13.1%, 5.0%, and 5.5% respectively). \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nThe overall incidence of veno-occlusive liver disease (VOD) was 0.9% (5/564). VOD occurred only \nwith the dose regimen of 14 g/m²/day treosulfan. None of these cases were fatal or life-threatening.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions reported in the table below are derived from two clinical trials (including a total \nof 88 patients; median age 8 years [range 0–17 years]) where treosulfan combined with fludarabine \n(and mostly with additional thiotepa) was administered as conditioning treatment prior to alloHSCT in \npaediatric patients with malignant or non-malignant diseases. Treosulfan was administered in a dose \nrange of 10-14 g/m² BSA on three consecutive days. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \n\n\n\n11 \n\nrare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

The frequency was higher in the paediatric age group 12–17 years (6/35 [17.1%]) \ncompared to younger children (4/53 [7.5%]). \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) \n \nFive cases of a second malignancy (myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, \nEwing’s sarcoma) were reported by other investigators after treosulfan-based conditioning. All five \npaediatric patients received alloHSCT for primary immunodeficiencies, i.e. diseases with an increased \nrisk for neoplasias per se. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n \nThe median (25%/75% percentiles) duration of neutropenia was 21 (16, 26) days in paediatric patients \nwith malignant diseases and 24 (17, 26) days in patients with non-malignant disorders. \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nSeizure in the context of an encephalitis infection was reported in one of 88 paediatric patients. A \nreport from an investigator-initiated trial performed in children with primary immunodeficiencies lists \nfour cases of seizures occurring after other treosulfan-based conditioning regimens (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe principal toxic effect of treosulfan is profound myeloablation and pancytopenia. In addition, \nacidosis, skin toxicity, nausea, vomiting and gastritis may occur. In the absence of haematopoietic \nstem cell transplantation, the recommended dose of treosulfan would constitute an overdose. No \nspecific antidote of treosulfan overdose is known. The haematologic status should be closely \nmonitored and vigorous supportive measures instituted as medically indicated.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, alkylating agents, ATC code: L01AB02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTreosulfan is a prodrug of a bifunctional alkylating agent with cytotoxic activity to haematopoietic \nprecursor cells. The activity of treosulfan is due to the spontaneous conversion into a mono-epoxide \nintermediate and L-diepoxybutan (see section 5.2). \nThe epoxides formed alkylate nucleophilic centres of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are able to \ninduce DNA cross-links which are considered responsible for the stem cell depleting and \nantineoplastic effects.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nTreosulfan has a broad antineoplastic and antileukaemic activity. This was demonstrated against \ntransplanted mouse and rat lymphomas/leukaemias, sarcomas and hepatomas, human tumour \nxenografts, human tumour biopsies and cell lines. \nThe immunosuppressive effects of treosulfan are attributed to its toxicity against primitive and \ncommitted progenitor cells, T and NK cells, reduction of cellularity of primary and secondary \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\nlymphatic organs and a preclusive effect on the ‘cytokine storm’ that precedes the development of \nGraft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) and is involved in the pathogenesis of veno-occlusive disease. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn the pivotal phase III trial, adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic \nsyndrome (MDS) and increased risk for standard conditioning therapies because of higher age \n(≥ 50 years) or comorbidities (haematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index [HCT-CI] score \n> 2) were randomised to receive a conditioning regimen with 3 × 10 g/m² treosulfan combined with \nfludarabine (FT10; n = 220) or a regimen of intravenous busulfan (total dose 6.4 mg/kg) combined with \nfludarabine (FB2; n = 240), followed by alloHSCT. 64% of patients had AML and 36% MDS. The \nmedian age of patients was 60 years (range 31–70 years); 25% of patients were older than 65 years. \nThe primary endpoint of this study was event-free survival (EFS) after 2 years. Events were defined as \nrelapse of disease, graft failure or death (whatever occurred first). Non-inferiority of FT10 versus the \nreference FB2 was statistically proven (Figure 1). \n \nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier estimates of event-free survival (Full Analysis Set) \n\n \na Adjusted for donor type as factor, and risk group and centre as strata using Cox regression model. \nb For testing non-inferiority of treosulfan compared to busulfan. \nc For testing superiority of treosulfan compared to busulfan. \n \nAnalyses of EFS at 2 years for various pre-defined subgroups (donor type, risk group, disease, age \ngroup, HCT-CI score, remission status at study entry, and various combinations of these parameters) \nwere always in favour of the treosulfan regimen (hazard ratio [HR] of FT10 vs. FB2 < 1), with only one \nexception (risk group I of MDS patients; HR 1.14 [95% CI 0.48, 2.63]). \nFurther results are shown in Table 1. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTable 1: Treatment results at 24 months (Full analysis set) \nParameter Treosulfan Busulfan Hazard ratiob  \n\n(95% CI) \nP valueb \n\nNumber of patients 220 240   \nOverall survivala; % (95% CI) 71.3 (63.6, \n\n77.6) \n56.4 (48.4, \n63.6) \n\n0.61 (0.42, \n0.88) \n\n0.0082 \n\nCumulative incidence of \nrelapse/progression; % (95% CI) \n\n24.6 (17.8, \n31.3) \n\n23.3 (17.6, \n29.0) \n\n0.87 (0.59, \n1.30) 0.5017 \n\nCumulative incidence of \ntransplant-related mortality; % \n(95% CI) \n\n12.1 (8.1, 17.7) 28.2 (21.4, 36.5) \n0.54 (0.32, \n0.91) 0.0201 \n\na Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates; b adjusted for donor type, risk group and centre using Cox \nregression model  \n\n \nResults of GvHD are shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Cumulative incidence of GvHD (Full analysis set) \nParameter Treosulfan Busulfan P value \nNumber of patients 220 240  \nAcute GvHD, all Grades; % (95% CI) 52.1 (45.5, 58.7) 58.8 (52.5, 65.0) 0.1276 \nAcute GvHD, Grades III/IV; % (95% \nCI) 6.4 (3.2, 9.6) 9.6 (5.9, 13.3) 0.2099 \n\nChronic GvHDa; % (95% CI) 60.1 (49.8, 70.3) 60.7 (53.1, 68.4) 0.5236 \nExtensive chronic GvHDa; % (95% CI) 18.4 (12.0, 24.8) 26.1 (19.2, 33.1) 0.1099 \na Up to 2 years after alloHSCT \n\n\n\n16 \n\nThere is limited information available on treosulfan-based conditioning (FT14 regimen ± thiotepa; see \nsection 4.2) in adult patients with non-malignant disorders (NMD). The main indications for an \nalloHSCT with treosulfan conditioning in adult NMD patients are haemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle \ncell disease, thalassaemia major [TM]), primary immune deficiency, hemophagocytic disorder, \nimmune dysregulatory disorder and bone marrow failure). \n \nIn one study, 31 NMD patients were treated with the FT14 regimen plus anti-thymocyte globulin. The \nage of the patients ranged from 0.4 to 30.5 years, and 29% had HCT-CI scores > 2. All patients \nengrafted, with a median time to neutrophil engraftment of 21 (range, 12–46) days. The two-year \nprojected overall survival was 90%. Complete disease responses were observed in 28 patients (90%), \nas measured by clinical symptoms and laboratory assays (Burroughs LM et al., Biology of Blood and \nMarrow Transplantation 2014; 20(12):1996-2003). \n \nAn Italian group treated 60 TM patients (age range 1-37 years; including 12 adults) with the FT14 plus \nthiotepa regimen. All patients engrafted except one, who died on day  +11; the median time to \nneutrophil and platelet recovery was 20 days. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 4-73), the \n5-year overall survival probability was 93% (95% CI 83-97%). No difference in terms of outcome was \nobserved between children and adults (Bernardo ME et al.; Blood 2012; 120(2):473-6). \n \nA retrospective comparison of treosulfan-based (n = 16) versus busulfan-based (n = 81) conditioning \nin adult patients revealed quite comparable survival rates (70.3 ± 15.1% vs. 69.3 ± 5.5%), while risk \nfor acute GvHD was lower in the treosulfan group (odds ratio 0.28; 95% CI 0.12-0.67; P = 0.004) \n(Caocci G et al.; American Journal of Hematology 2017; 92(12):1303-1310). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe efficacy and safety of treosulfan-based conditioning was evaluated in 70 patients with acute \nlymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), AML, MDS, or juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) who \nreceived a conditioning regimen with treosulfan and fludarabine with (n = 65) or without (n = 5) \nthiotepa (see section 4.2). A total of 37 patients (52.9%) were younger than 12 years. \nNo patient experienced a primary graft failure but one patient with ALL experienced a secondary graft \nfailure. The incidence of complete donor-type chimerism was 94.2% (90% CI 87.2-98.0%) at day +28 \nvisit, 91.3% (90% CI 83.6-96.1%) at day +100 visit and 91.2% (90% CI 82.4-96.5%) at month 12 \nvisit.  \nThe overall survival at 12 months is 91.4% (90% CI 83.9-95.5%). A total of 7 of the 70 patients \n(10.0%) died, two patients because of relapse/progression, three patients transplant-related and two \nfurther patients for other reasons. The freedom from transplant-related mortality until day +100 after \nHSCT (primary endpoint) is 98.6% (90% CI 93.4–99.7%) because one of the 70 patients died due to \ntransplantation/treatment-related cause until day +100 after HSCT. Transplant-related mortality at \n12 months is 2.9% (90% CI 0.9 – 8.9%). Eleven patients had a relapse/progression. The cumulative \nincidence of relapse/progression is 15.7% (90% CI 8.6-22.9%) at month +12. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of a study with \ntreosulfan-based conditioning in paediatric patients with non-malignant diseases (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTreosulfan is a prodrug that is spontaneously converted under physiological conditions (pH 7.4; \n37 °C) into a monoepoxide intermediate and L-diepoxybutane with a half-life of 2.2 hours. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter intravenous administration, peak plasma levels are reached at the end of the infusion time. \nMaximum plasma levels (mean ± SD) in adult patients after a 2-hour intravenous infusion of 10, 12, or \n14 g/m² treosulfan were 306 ± 94 µg/mL, 461 ± 102 µg/mL, and 494 ± 126 µg/mL, respectively. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nDistribution \n \nTreosulfan is rapidly distributed in the body; however, its penetration through the blood-brain-barrier \nis quite limited (see section 5.3). The volume of distribution in adult patients is about 20–30 litres. No \ndose accumulation with the recommended daily treatment on three consecutive days was observed. \nTreosulfan does not bind to plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nUnder physiological conditions (pH 7.4, temperature 37 °C), the pharmacologically inactive treosulfan \nis converted spontaneously (non-enzymatically) into the active monoepoxide intermediate \n(S,S-EBDM = (2S,3S)-1,2-epoxybutane-3,4-diol-4-methanesulfonate) and finally to L-diepoxibutane \n(S,S-DEB = (2S,3S)-1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane). \nAt concentrations up to 100 µM, treosulfan has no unequivocal effect on CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, \nor 3A4 activities in vitro. Therefore, treosulfan is unlikely to participate in, or contribute to, potential \nCYP450-mediated interactions in vivo. \n \nElimination \n \nPlasma concentrations of treosulfan decline exponentially and are best described by a first order \nelimination process fitted by a two-compartment model.  \nThe terminal half-life (T1/2ß) of intravenously administered treosulfan (up to 47 g/m²) is approximately \n2 hours. Approximately 25–40% of the treosulfan dose is excreted unchanged with the urine within \n24 hours, nearly 90% of which within the first 6 hours after administration. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nRegression analysis of the area under the curve (AUC0-∞) versus treosulfan dose indicated a linear \ncorrelation. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \n \nNo pharmacokinetic studies with treosulfan were done in patients with severe renal or hepatic \nimpairment, because such patients are generally excluded from alloHSCT. About 25–40% of \ntreosulfan is excreted in urine; however, an influence of renal function on renal clearance of treosulfan \nwas not observed. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nConventional dose calculation simply based on BSA results in a significantly higher exposure (AUC) \nof smaller children and infants with low BSA compared to adolescents or adults. Therefore, dosing of \ntreosulfan in paediatric patients has to be adapted to the BSA (see section 4.2). \nMean apparent terminal half-life of treosulfan was comparable between the different age groups and \nranged between 1.3 and 1.6 hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDue to its alkylating mechanism of action treosulfan is characterised as a genotoxic compound with \ncarcinogenic potential. Specific reproductive and developmental toxicity studies on treosulfan in \nanimals were not conducted. However, during chronic toxicity tests in rats spermatogenesis and \novarian function were significantly affected. Published literature data report on gonadotoxicity of \ntreosulfan in pre-pubertal and pubertal male and female mice.  \nPublished data concerning treatment of mice and rats with L-diepoxibutane (the alkylating \ntransformation product of treosulfan) revealed impairment of fertility, uterine-ovarian and sperm \ndevelopment. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nJuvenile animal studies \n \nIn juvenile rat toxicity studies treosulfan induced slight retardation of physical development and a \nslightly delayed time-point of vaginal opening in females. A very low penetration of \nblood-brain-barrier by treosulfan was observed in rats. The treosulfan concentrations in brain tissue \nwere 95%–98% lower than in plasma. However, an approximately 3-fold higher exposure in brain \ntissue of juvenile rats in comparison to young adults was found. \n \n \n6.

If not used immediately, in-use \nstorage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.  \nDo not store in a refrigerator (2 °C-8 °C) as this might cause precipitation. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.  \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nTrecondi 1 g powder for solution for infusion \nColourless type III glass vial, with rubber stopper and aluminium cap containing 1 g of treosulfan. \n \nTrecondi 5 g powder for solution for infusion \nColourless type III glass vial, with rubber stopper and aluminium cap containing 5 g of treosulfan. \n \nTrecondi is available in packs of 1 or 5 vials. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nAs with all cytotoxic substances, appropriate precautions should be taken when handling treosulfan. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nTrained personnel should reconstitute the medicinal product. When handling treosulfan, inhalation, \nskin contact or contact with mucous membranes should be avoided (the use of adequate protective \ndisposable gloves, goggles, gown and mask is recommended). Contaminated body parts should be \ncarefully rinsed with water and soap, the eyes should be rinsed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution. If possible it is recommended to work on a special safety workbench, equipped with laminar \nflow, with liquid-impermeable, absorbent disposable foil. Adequate care and precautions should be \ntaken in the disposal of items (syringes, needles, etc.) used to reconstitute cytotoxic medicinal \nproducts. Use Luer-lock fittings on all syringes and sets. Large bore needles are recommended to \nminimise pressure and the possible formation of aerosols. The latter may also be reduced by the use of \na venting needle.  \nPregnant personnel should be excluded from handling cytotoxics. \n \nInstructions for reconstitution of treosulfan: \n1. Treosulfan is reconstituted in its original glass container. Reconstituted solutions of treosulfan \n\nmay be combined into a larger glass vial, PVC bag or PE bag. \n2. To avoid solubility problems, warm the solvent, sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution, \n\nto 25 °C - 30 °C (not higher), for example by using a water bath. \n3. Remove the treosulfan powder carefully from the inner surface of the vial by shaking. This \n\nprocedure is very important, because moistening of powder that sticks to the surface results in \ncaking. If this happens, vigorously shake the vial to redissolve the cake. \n\n4. Reconstitute each vial of Trecondi containing 1 g treosulfan in 20 mL of pre-warmed \n(maximum 30 °C) sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution by shaking. \nReconstitute each vial of Trecondi containing 5 g treosulfan in 100 mL of pre-warmed \n(maximum 30 °C) sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution by shaking. \n\n \nFor preparation of sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution equivalent volumes of sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution and water for injections can be mixed. \n \nThe reconstituted solution contains 50 mg treosulfan per mL and appears as a clear colourless solution. \nSolutions showing any sign of precipitation should not be used. \n \nTreosulfan has mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. Remnants of the medicinal product as well as all \nmaterials that have been used for reconstitution and administration must be destroyed according to \nstandard procedures applicable to antineoplastic agents, with due regard to current laws related to the \ndisposal of hazardous waste. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again.  \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Trecondi is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Trecondi \n3. How to use Trecondi  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Trecondi \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Trecondi is and what it is used for \n \nTrecondi contains the active substance treosulfan, which belongs to a group of medicines called \nalkylating agents. Treosulfan is used to prepare patients for bone marrow transplant (haematopoietic \nstem cell transplantation). Treosulfan destroys the bone marrow cells and enables the transplant of new \nbone marrow cells which leads to the production of healthy blood cells. \n \nTrecondi is used as a treatment before blood stem cell transplantation in adults with cancer and \nnon-cancerous disorders, and in adolescents and children older than one month with cancer.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Trecondi  \n \nDo not use Trecondi \n if you are allergic to treosulfan, \n if you suffer from an active uncontrolled infection, \n if you suffer from severe heart, lung, liver or kidney diseases, \n if you suffer from hereditary DNA repair disorder, a condition that reduces the ability to repair \n\nDNA (which carries your genetic information), \n if you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTrecondi is a cell-killing (cytotoxic) medicine that is used to decrease the number of blood cells. At \nthe recommended dose, this is the desired effect. You will have regular blood tests during treatment to \ncheck your blood cell counts do not fall too low. \n \nIn order to prevent and treat infections, you will be given medicines, such as antibiotics, antifungals or \nantivirals. \n \nTrecondi may increase the risk of having another cancer in the future. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nSince inflammation of the oral mucosa is a common side effect of this medicine, you should pay \nattention to adequate oral hygiene. Prophylactic use of mouthwashes (e.g. with barrier protectants, \nantimicrobials) or application of ice within the oral cavity (lessens blood flow to the oral mucosa and \nreduces the amount of treosulfan reaching the cell) is recommended. \n \nYou must not receive live vaccines during treatment with treosulfan. \n \nTrecondi may cause symptoms of the menopause (absence of menstrual periods).  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nFits (seizures) may occur very rarely in infants of less than 4 months of age. Children younger than \n1 year may have more severe side effects that affect breathing than older ones. Your child will be \nmonitored for signs of side effects affecting nerves and breathing problems.  \n \nNappy rash with ulceration of the area around the anus (perianal) may occur in infants, toddlers and \nchildren wearing nappies because treosulfan passed out in the urine can damage the skin. Therefore, \nnappies should be changed frequently during 6–8 hours after each dose of this medicine.  \n \nThere is not sufficient information on the use of treosulfan in children aged less than 1 month. \n \nOther medicines and Trecondi \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nYou must not get pregnant during treatment with this medicine and up to 6 months after treatment. \nUse an effective method of contraception when either you or your partner is receiving this medicine. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. \n \nYou should stop breast-feeding before starting treatment with this medicine. \n \nIf you are a man treated with this medicine, you should not father a child during and up to 6 months \nafter treatment.  \n \nThis medicine may make you infertile and it may not be possible for you to get pregnant after \ntreatment with it. If you are concerned about having children, you should discuss this with your doctor \nbefore treatment. Men should seek advice about the possibility of sperm preservation before starting \ntherapy. \n  \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine can cause nausea, vomiting and dizziness which may reduce your ability to drive or use \nmachines. If you are affected, do not drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use Trecondi \n \nUse in adults \nThis medicine is used in combination with fludarabine. \nThe recommended dose is 10–14 g/m² body surface area (calculated using your height and weight).  \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThis medicine is used in combination with fludarabine and in most cases also with thiotepa. The \nrecommended dose is 10–14 g/m² body surface area.  \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nHow Trecondi is given \nThis medicine will be given to you by your doctor. It is given by drip (infusion) into a vein over \n2 hours for 3 days before blood stem cell infusion. \n \nIf you were given more Trecondi than you should \nBecause this medicine is given by a doctor, you will be given the correct dose. However, if you think \nyou have received more of this medicine than you should, tell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \nThe most serious side effects of treosulfan therapy or the transplant procedure include:  \n• decrease in blood cell counts which is the intended effect of the medicine to prepare you for \n\nyour transplant infusion (all patients: very common)  \n•

There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments.  \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nAs with all cytotoxic substances, appropriate precautions should be taken when handling treosulfan. \n \nTrained personnel should reconstitute the medicinal product. When handling treosulfan, inhalation, \nskin contact or contact with mucous membranes should be avoided (the use of adequate protective \ndisposable gloves, goggles, gown and mask is recommended). Contaminated body parts should be \ncarefully rinsed with water and soap, the eyes should be rinsed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution. If possible it is recommended to work on a special safety workbench, equipped with laminar \nflow, with liquid-impermeable, absorbent disposable foil. Adequate care and precautions should be \ntaken in the disposal of items (syringes, needles, etc.) used to reconstitute cytotoxic medicinal \nproducts. Use Luer-lock fittings on all syringes and sets. Large bore needles are recommended to \nminimise pressure and the possible formation of aerosols. The latter may also be reduced by the use of \na venting needle.  \nPregnant personnel should be excluded from handling cytotoxics. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nInstructions for reconstitution of treosulfan: \n1. Treosulfan is reconstituted in its original glass container. Reconstituted solutions of treosulfan \n\nmay be combined into a larger glass vial, PVC bag or PE bag. \n2. To avoid solubility problems, warm the solvent, sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution, \n\nto 25 °C - 30 °C (not higher), for example by using a water bath. \n3. Remove the treosulfan powder carefully from the inner surface of the vial by shaking. This \n\nprocedure is very important, because moistening of powder that sticks to the surface results in \ncaking. If this happens, vigorously shake the vial to redissolve the cake. \n\n4. Reconstitute each vial of Trecondi containing 1 g treosulfan in 20 mL of pre-warmed \n(maximum 30 °C) sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution by shaking. \nReconstitute each vial of Trecondi containing 5 g treosulfan in 100 mL of pre-warmed \n(maximum 30 °C) sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution by shaking. \n\n \nFor preparation of sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution equivalent volumes of sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution and water for injections can be mixed. \n \nReconstituted solution for infusion \nThe reconstituted solution contains 50 mg treosulfan per mL and appears as a clear colourless solution.  \nSolutions showing any sign of precipitation should not be used. \n \nAfter reconstitution with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution, chemical and physical stability \nhas been demonstrated for 2 days at 25 °C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution precludes the risk of \nmicrobial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use \nstorage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.  \nDo not store the reconstituted solution in a refrigerator (2 °C - 8 °C) as this might cause precipitation. \n \nTreosulfan has mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. Remnants of the medicinal product as well as all \nmaterials that have been used for reconstitution and administration must be destroyed according to \nstandard procedures applicable to antineoplastic agents, with due regard to current laws related to the \ndisposal of hazardous waste. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
