PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nYellow, biconvex, 0.7 cm diameter round, film-coated tablets with \u201c5\u201d engraved on one side and \n\u201c1427\u201d engraved on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nForxiga is indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as \nan adjunct to diet and exercise\n- as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance.\n- in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFor study results with respect to combination of therapies, effects on glycaemic control and\ncardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\nForxiga is indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus as \nan adjunct to insulin in patients with BMI \u2265 27 kg/m2, when insulin alone does not provide adequate \nglycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nThe recommended dose is 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily.\n\nWhen dapagliflozin is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, such as a \nsulphonylurea, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be considered to reduce the risk of \nhypoglycaemia (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\nTreatment with Forxiga is to be initiated and supervised by specialists in type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe recommended dose is 5 mg once daily.\n\nDapagliflozin must only be administered as an adjunct to insulin. \n\n\n\n3\n\nBefore initiating treatment with dapagliflozin:\n\uf0b7 Risk factors for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) should be assessed (see section 4.4).\n\uf0b7 It should be ensured that ketone levels are normal. If ketones are elevated (blood beta-\n\nhydroxybutyrate reading greater than 0.6 mmol/L or urine ketones one plus (+)), treatment with \ndapagliflozin should not be started until the ketone levels are normal (see section 4.4).\n\n\uf0b7 It should be ensured that the patient demonstrates the ability to monitor ketone levels.\n\uf0b7 It is recommended that patients obtain several baseline ketone levels over one to two weeks \n\nprior to initiation of dapagliflozin therapy, and patients should become familiar with how their \nbehaviours and circumstances affect their ketone levels.\n\n\uf0b7 Patients should be informed, in a dedicated education session, on the risk of DKA, how to \nrecognize DKA risk factors, signs or symptoms, how and when to monitor ketone levels and \nwhat actions to take at elevated ketone readings (see section 4.4).\n\n\uf0b7 Correction of volume depletion prior to initiation of dapagliflozin is recommended in patients \nwith this condition (see section 4.4).\n\nIn order to avoid hypoglycaemia with the first dose of dapagliflozin, a 20% reduction in the first \nmealtime bolus insulin may be considered. Subsequent bolus doses should be adjusted individually \nbased on blood glucose results. No reduction in basal insulin is recommended when initiating \ndapagliflozin. Subsequently, basal insulin should be adjusted based on blood glucose results. When \nneeded, insulin dose reduction should be done cautiously to avoid ketosis and DKA.\n\nKetone monitoring during treatment:\nDuring the initial one to two weeks of treatment with dapagliflozin, ketones should be monitored on a \nregular basis, then the frequency of ketone level testing should be individualized, according to the \npatient's lifestyle and/or risk factors (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients should be informed about what actions to take if ketone levels are elevated. The \nrecommended actions are listed in Table 1. Measurement of blood ketone levels is preferred to urine.\n\nTable 1\nClinical stage Blood Ketone (beta-\n\nhydroxybutyrate)\nUrine Ketone Actions \n\nKetonaemia 0.6-1.5 mmol/L Trace or Small \n+ \n\nThe patient may need to take \nextra insulin and drink water. \nThe patient should measure \nblood glucose and consider \ntaking extra carbohydrates if the \nglucose levels are normal or \nlow.\n\nKetone levels should be \nmeasured again after two hours.\n\nThe patient should immediately \nseek medical advice and stop \ntaking dapagliflozin if levels \npersist and symptoms present.\n\nImpending DKA > 1.5-3.0 mmol/L Moderate \n++ \n\nThe patient should immediately \nseek medical advice and stop \ntaking dapagliflozin.\n\nThe patient may need to take \nextra insulin and drink water. \nThe patient should measure \nblood glucose and consider \n\n\n\n4\n\ntaking extra carbohydrates if the \nglucose levels are normal or \nlow.\n\nKetone levels should be \nmeasured again after two hours.\n\nProbable DKA > 3.0 mmol/L Large to very \nlarge \n+++ / ++++ \n\nThe patient should go to \nemergency department without \ndelay and stop taking \ndapagliflozin.\n\nThe patient may need to take \nextra insulin and drink water. \nThe patient should measure \nblood glucose and consider \ntaking extra carbohydrates if the \nglucose levels are normal or \nlow.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nForxiga should not be initiated in patients with a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min and \nshould be discontinued at GFR persistently below 45 mL/min (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nNo dose adjustment is required based on renal function.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended. If well tolerated, the dose \nmay be increased to 10 mg when indicated (see sections 4.1 of the 10 mg SmPC, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nIn general, no dose adjustment is recommended based on age. Renal function and risk of volume \ndepletion should be taken into account (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin in children aged 0 to < 18 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nForxiga can be taken orally once daily at any time of day with or without food. Tablets are to be \nswallowed whole.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRenal impairment\nThe glycaemic efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal function, and efficacy is reduced in \npatients who have moderate renal impairment and is likely absent in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (see section 4.2). In subjects with moderate renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min), a \nhigher proportion of subjects treated with dapagliflozin had adverse reactions of increase in creatinine, \nphosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypotension, compared with placebo.\n\n\n\n5\n\nForxiga should not be initiated in patients with a GFR < 60 mL/min and should be discontinued at \nGFR persistently below 45 mL/min. Forxiga has not been studied in severe renal impairment \n(GFR < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n\nMonitoring of renal function is recommended as follows:\n\u2022 Prior to initiation of dapagliflozin and at least yearly, thereafter (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and \n\n5.2).\n\u2022 Prior to initiation of concomitant medicinal products that may reduce renal function and \n\nperiodically thereafter.\n\u2022 For renal function with GFR < 60 mL/min, at least 2 to 4 times per year.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThere is limited experience in clinical studies in patients with hepatic impairment. Dapagliflozin \nexposure is increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nUse in patients at risk for volume depletion and/or hypotension\nDue to its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin increases diuresis which may lead to the modest \ndecrease in blood pressure observed in clinical studies (see section 5.1). It may be more pronounced in \npatients with very high blood glucose concentrations.\n\nCaution should be exercised in patients for whom a dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure \ncould pose a risk, such as patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or \nelderly patients.\n\nIn case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), \ncareful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, \nlaboratory tests including haematocrit and electrolytes) is recommended. Temporary interruption of \ntreatment with dapagliflozin is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until the \ndepletion is corrected (see section 4.8).\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nSodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with \nincreased risk of DKA. Patients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low \nbeta-cell function reserve (e.g. type 1 diabetes patients, type 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or \nlatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or patients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with \nconditions that lead to restricted food intake or severe dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are \nreduced and patients with increased insulin requirements due to acute medical illness, surgery or \nalcohol abuse.\n\nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual \nfatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms \noccur, regardless of blood glucose level.\n\nBefore initiating dapagliflozin, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should \nbe considered.\n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of \nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with dapagliflozin may be restarted when the \nketone values are normal and the patient\u2019s condition has stabilised.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nRare cases of DKA, including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been reported in patients treated \nwith SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. In a number of cases, the presentation of the condition \nwas atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL).\n\n\n\n6\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, dapagliflozin treatment should be stopped \nimmediately.\n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients experiencing a DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus studies with dapagliflozin, patients had a higher number of DKA events \ncompared with the placebo group (see section 4.8). \n\nBefore initiating dapagliflozin\nBefore starting treatment, patients should be evaluated with respect to DKA risk. \nDapagliflozin should not be initiated when patients are at a higher risk of DKA, such as:\n\uf0b7 Patients with low insulin needs.\n\uf0b7 Patient not on optimal insulin dose or who have recent issues with noncompliance or recurrent \n\nerrors with insulin dosing and who are unlikely to maintain adequate insulin dosing.\n\uf0b7 Patients with increased insulin requirements due to acute medical illness or surgery. \n\uf0b7 Patients who insist on maintaining caloric restriction, carbohydrate restriction or ketogenic diet \n\nor who chronically under-dose insulin (e.g. in order to remain in a lipolytic state). \n\uf0b7 Patients with recent or recurrent history of DKA. \n\uf0b7 Patients with elevated ketones levels (BHB reading is greater than 0.6 mmol/L or urine ketones \n\none plus (+)). If ketones are elevated (blood beta-hydroxybutyrate reading 0.6 mmol/L or \ngreater), treatment with dapagliflozin should not be started until the ketone levels are normal \n(see section 4.2).\n\n\uf0b7 Patients unable or unwilling to monitor ketones.\n\uf0b7 Patients with excessive alcohol consumption or who use illicit drugs.\n\nPatients using an insulin infusion pump have a higher risk of DKA and should be experienced with \npump use, common trouble-shooting strategies when interruptions of insulin delivery via pump occur \n(issues with insertion site, clogged tubing, empty reservoir, etc.) and use of supplemental insulin \ninjections with pen or syringe as needed in case of pump failure.  Patients should consider monitoring \nketones levels three to four hours after changing pump materials. Patients using a pump should also \ncheck their ketone levels with any suspected insulin interruption, regardless of blood glucose levels. \nInsulin injections should be given within 2 hours of an unexplained high blood glucose/ketone value \nand dapagliflozin treatment should be interrupted.\n\n\uf0b7 The patients should be educated on the risk of DKA, emphasizing that DKA could occur even \nwhen blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). \n\n\uf0b7 The patient should be informed how to recognize the risk factors which can predispose to \nketosis (including starvation ketosis) and DKA and how to recognize DKA signs or symptoms.\n\n\uf0b7 Dapagliflozin should only be given to patients who are able to monitor ketone levels and are \neducated in when it is most appropriate to do so. \n\n\uf0b7 Dapagliflozin should only be given to patients with access to ketone testing materials and \nimmediate access to a clinician if blood or urine ketones are elevated.\n\n\uf0b7 The patients should be educated on what actions to take when ketosis/DKA is suspected and \nwhen to discontinue dapagliflozin therapy (see section 4.2). \n\n\uf0b7 DKA should be treated as per standard of care. Supplemental carbohydrate may be required in \naddition to hydration and additional rapid insulin (see Table 1 in section 4.2).\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, dapagliflozin treatment should be stopped \nimmediately.\n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients experiencing a DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\n\n\n7\n\nDuring treatment with dapagliflozin:\n\uf0b7 Insulin therapy should be continuously optimised.  \n\uf0b7 When needed to prevent hypoglycaemia, insulin dose reduction should be done cautiously to \n\navoid ketosis and DKA (see section 4.2).\n\uf0b7 In the event of a marked reduction of insulin need, discontinuation of dapagliflozin should be \n\nconsidered.\n\nKetone monitoring:\nThe patient should be advised to test their ketone level (urine or blood) if signs or symptoms of \nketoacidosis occur. Measurement of blood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Ketones should be \nmonitored on a regular basis during the initial one to two weeks, then the frequency of ketone level \ntesting should be individualised, according to the patient's lifestyle and/or risk factors (see section 4.2).\nKetone levels should be also checked in situations that may predispose to or increase risk of DKA. \n\nPatients must be informed about what actions to take if ketone levels are elevated. The recommended \nactions are listed in Table 1 (see section 4.2).\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\nPostmarketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier\u2019s gangrene) have \nbeen reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors (see section 4.8). This is a rare but \nserious and potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic \ntreatment.\n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier\u2019s \ngangrene is suspected, Forxiga should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics and \nsurgical debridement) should be instituted.\n\nUrinary tract infections\nUrinary glucose excretion may be associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection; \ntherefore, temporary interruption of dapagliflozin should be considered when treating pyelonephritis \nor urosepsis.\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nElderly patients may be at a greater risk for volume depletion and are more likely to be treated with \ndiuretics.\n\nElderly patients are more likely to have impaired renal function, and/or to be treated with \nanti-hypertensive medicinal products that may cause changes in renal function such as \nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB). \nThe same recommendations for renal function apply to elderly patients as to all patients (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nCardiac failure\nThere is no experience in clinical studies with dapagliflozin in NYHA class IV.\n\nLower limb amputations\nAn increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in ongoing \nlong-term, clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class \neffect. Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot care.\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\nDue to its mechanism of action, patients taking Forxiga will test positive for glucose in their urine.\n\n\n\n8\n\nLactose\nThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\nDiuretics\nDapagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of \ndehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower \ndose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when \nused in combination with dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see sections 4.2 and \n4.8).\n\nIn patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and a known risk of frequent or severe hypoglycaemia, it may \nbe necessary to reduce the insulin dose at the time of initiating treatment with dapagliflozin to \ndecrease the risk of hypoglycaemia. When needed, insulin dose reduction should be done cautiously to \navoid ketosis and DKA (see section 4.2).\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\nThe metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by \nUDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9).\n\nIn in vitro studies, dapagliflozin neither inhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. \nTherefore, dapagliflozin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered medicinal \nproducts that are metabolised by these enzymes.\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on dapagliflozin\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, suggest that the \npharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin are not altered by metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, \nvoglibose, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, or simvastatin.\n\nFollowing coadministration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various active transporters \nand drug-metabolising enzymes) a 22% decrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure (AUC) was \nobserved, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24-hour urinary glucose excretion. No dose \nadjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, phenobarbital) is not expected.\n\nFollowing coadministration of dapagliflozin with mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55% \nincrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on \n24-hour urinary glucose excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended.\n\nEffect of dapagliflozin on other medicinal products\nIn interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, dapagliflozin \ndid not alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, \nhydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, digoxin (a P-gp substrate) or warfarin (S-warfarin, a \nCYP2C9 substrate), or the anticoagulatory effects of warfarin as measured by INR. Combination of a \nsingle dose of dapagliflozin 20 mg and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19% increase in \nAUC of simvastatin and 31% increase in AUC of simvastatin acid. The increase in simvastatin and \nsimvastatin acid exposures are not considered clinically relevant.\n\n\n\n9\n\nInterference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay\nMonitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are \nunreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use of alternative \nmethods to monitor glycaemic control is advised.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of dapagliflozin in pregnant women. Studies in rats have shown \ntoxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of \nhuman pregnancy (see section 5.3). Therefore, the use of dapagliflozin is not recommended during the \nsecond and third trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nWhen pregnancy is detected, treatment with dapagliflozin should be discontinued.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether dapagliflozin and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of dapagliflozin/metabolites in \nmilk, as well as pharmacologically-mediated effects in nursing offspring (see section 5.3). A risk to \nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Dapagliflozin should not be used while breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of dapagliflozin on fertility in humans has not been studied. In male and female rats, \ndapagliflozin showed no effects on fertility at any dose tested.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nForxiga has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \nalerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when dapagliflozin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea \nor insulin.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nIn the clinical studies in type 2 diabetes, more than 15,000 patients have been treated with \ndapagliflozin.\n\nThe primary assessment of safety and tolerability was conducted in a pre-specified pooled analysis of \n13 short-term (up to 24 weeks) placebo-controlled studies with 2,360 subjects treated with \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and 2,295 treated with placebo.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study (see section 5.1), 8,574 patients received \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and 8,569 received placebo for a median exposure time of 48 months. In total, \nthere were 30,623 patient-years of exposure to dapagliflozin.\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions across the clinical studies were genital infections.\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\nIn two placebo-controlled studies in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus, 548 subjects were treated \nwith dapagliflozin 5 mg plus adjustable insulin and 532 were treated with placebo plus adjustable \ninsulin.\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with dapagliflozin in patients with type 1 \ndiabetes mellitus were genital infections, which were more frequent in females. Diabetic ketoacidosis \nwas reported with common frequency. See \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d and section 4.4.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified in the placebo-controlled clinical studies and \npostmarketing surveillance. None were found to be dose-related. Adverse reactions listed below are \nclassified according to frequency and system organ class (SOC). Frequency categories are defined \naccording to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), and not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 2.

Most \ninfections were mild to moderate, and subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment and \nrarely resulted in discontinuation from dapagliflozin treatment. These infections were more frequent in \nfemales (8.4% and 1.2% for dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively), and subjects with a prior history \nwere more likely to have a recurrent infection.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, the number of patients with serious adverse events \nof genital infections were few and balanced: 2 patients in each of the dapagliflozin and placebo \ngroups.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\nCases of Fournier\u2019s gangrene have been reported postmarketing in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, \nincluding dapagliflozin (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study with 17,160 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and a \nmedian exposure time of 48 months, a total of 6 cases of Fournier\u2019s gangrene were reported, one in the \ndapagliflozin-treated group and 5 in the placebo group.\n\nHypoglycaemia\nThe frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the type of background therapy used in each study.\n\nFor studies of dapagliflozin in monotherapy, as add-on to metformin or as add-on to sitagliptin (with \nor without metformin), the frequency of minor episodes of hypoglycaemia was similar (< 5%) \nbetween treatment groups, including placebo up to 102 weeks of treatment. Across all studies, major \nevents of hypoglycaemia were uncommon and comparable between the groups treated with \ndapagliflozin or placebo. Studies with add-on sulphonylurea and add-on insulin therapies had higher \nrates of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n12\n\nIn an add-on to glimepiride study, at Weeks 24 and 48, minor episodes of hypoglycaemia were \nreported more frequently in the group treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus glimepiride (6.0% and \n7.9%, respectively) than in the placebo plus glimepiride group (2.1% and 2.1%, respectively).\n\nIn an add-on to insulin study, episodes of major hypoglycaemia were reported in 0.5% and 1.0% of \nsubjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus insulin at Weeks 24 and 104, respectively, and in 0.5% \nof subjects treated with placebo plus insulin groups at Weeks 24 and 104. At Weeks 24 and 104, minor \nepisodes of hypoglycaemia were reported, respectively, in 40.3% and 53.1% of subjects who received \ndapagliflozin 10 mg plus insulin and in 34.0% and 41.6% of the subjects who received placebo plus \ninsulin.\n\nIn an add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea study, up to 24 weeks, no episodes of major \nhypoglycaemia were reported. Minor episodes of hypoglycaemia were reported in 12.8% of subjects \nwho received dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin and a sulphonylurea and in 3.7% of subjects who \nreceived placebo plus metformin and a sulphonylurea. \n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, no increased risk of major hypoglycaemia was \nobserved with dapagliflozin therapy compared with placebo. Major events of hypoglycaemia were \nreported in 58 (0.7%) patients treated with dapagliflozin and 83 (1.0%) patients treated with placebo.\n\nVolume depletion\nIn the 13-study safety pool, reactions suggestive of volume depletion (including, reports of \ndehydration, hypovolaemia or hypotension) were reported in 1.1% and 0.7% of subjects who received \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively; serious reactions occurred in < 0.2% of subjects \nbalanced between dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, the numbers of patients with events suggestive of \nvolume depletion were balanced between treatment groups: 213 (2.5%) and 207 (2.4%) in the \ndapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (0.9%) and \n70 (0.8%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively. Events were generally balanced \nbetween treatment groups across subgroups of age, diuretic use, blood pressure and ACE-I/ARB use. \nIn patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline, there were 19 events of serious adverse \nevents suggestive of volume depletion in the dapagliflozin group and 13 events in the placebo group.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, with a median exposure time of 48 months, events \nof DKA were reported in 27 patients in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients in the placebo \ngroup. The events occurred evenly distributed over the study period. Of the 27 patients with DKA \nevents in the dapagliflozin group, 22 had concomitant insulin treatment at the time of the event. \nPrecipitating factors for DKA were as expected in a type 2 diabetes mellitus population (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nUrinary tract infections\nIn the 13-study safety pool, urinary tract infections were more frequently reported for \ndapagliflozin 10 mg compared to placebo (4.7% versus 3.5%, respectively; see section 4.4). Most \ninfections were mild to moderate, and subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment and \nrarely resulted in discontinuation from dapagliflozin treatment. These infections were more frequent in \nfemales, and subjects with a prior history were more likely to have a recurrent infection.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, serious events of urinary tract infections were \nreported less frequently for dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo, 79 (0.9%) events versus \n109 (1.3%) events, respectively.\n\nIncreased creatinine\nAdverse reactions related to increased creatinine were grouped (e.g. decreased renal creatinine \nclearance, renal impairment, increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration rate). This \n\n\n\n13\n\ngrouping of reactions was reported in 3.2% and 1.8% of patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg \nand placebo, respectively. In patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (baseline \neGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) this grouping of reactions were reported in 1.3% and 0.8% of patients \nwho received dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. These reactions were more common in \npatients with baseline eGFR \u2265 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (18.5% dapagliflozin 10 mg versus 9.3% \nplacebo).\n\nFurther evaluation of patients who had renal-related adverse events showed that most had serum \ncreatinine changes of \u2264 0.5 mg/dL from baseline. The increases in creatinine were generally transient \nduring continuous treatment or reversible after discontinuation of treatment.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, including elderly patients and patients with renal \nimpairment (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), eGFR decreased over time in both treatment groups. \nAt 1 year, mean eGFR was slightly lower, and at 4 years, mean eGFR was slightly higher in the \ndapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group.\n\nClinical studies in type 1 diabetes mellitus\nThe safety profile of dapagliflozin in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus was similar to the known \nsafety profile of dapagliflozin in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with the exception of a higher \nnumber of DKA events in dapagliflozin-treated subjects in the type 1 diabetes mellitus studies.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nIn the two placebo-controlled clinical studies of dapagliflozin in type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients were \nadvised to monitor blood ketones in case of suspected symptoms of DKA and seek medical \nadvice/attention if their self-measured blood ketone reading was \u2265 0.6 mmol/L. In the pooled 52-week \ndata, events of DKA were reported in 22 (4.0%) patients in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group and 6 (1.1%) \npatients in the placebo group, with corresponding incidence rates per 100 patient years of 4.62 for \ndapagliflozin 5 mg and 1.27 for placebo. DKA events occurred evenly distributed over the clinical \nstudy period. Inadequate insulin doses (missed insulin dose or insulin pump failure) were the most \ncommon precipitating factors. 6 of 23 events of DKA in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group occurred in \npatients with blood glucose in the euglycaemic range (< 14 mmol/L or 250 mg/dL).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDapagliflozin did not show any toxicity in healthy subjects at single oral doses up to 500 mg (50 times \nthe maximum recommended human dose). These subjects had detectable glucose in the urine for a \ndose-related period of time (at least 5 days for the 500 mg dose), with no reports of dehydration, \nhypotension or electrolyte imbalance, and with no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval. The \nincidence of hypoglycaemia was similar to placebo. In clinical studies where once-daily doses of up to \n100 mg (10 times the maximum recommended human dose) were administered for 2 weeks in healthy \nsubjects and type 2 diabetes subjects, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was slightly higher than placebo \nand was not dose-related. Rates of adverse events including dehydration or hypotension were similar \nto placebo, and there were no clinically meaningful dose-related changes in laboratory parameters, \nincluding serum electrolytes and biomarkers of renal function.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the \npatient\u2019s clinical status. The removal of dapagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.\n\n\n\n14\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) \ninhibitors, ATC code: A10BK01\n\nMechanism of action\nDapagliflozin is a highly potent (Ki: 0.55 nM), selective and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2.\n\nThe SGLT2 is selectively expressed in the kidney with no expression detected in more than 70 other \ntissues including liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, breast, bladder and brain. SGLT2 is the \npredominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into \nthe circulation. Despite the presence of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, reabsorption of filtered \nglucose continues. Dapagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels by \nreducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. This glucose excretion \n(glucuretic effect) is observed after the first dose, is continuous over the 24-hour dosing interval and is \nsustained for the duration of treatment. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this \nmechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and GFR. Dapagliflozin does not \nimpair normal endogenous glucose production in response to hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin acts \nindependently of insulin secretion and insulin action. Improvement in homeostasis model assessment \nfor beta cell function (HOMA beta-cell) has been observed in clinical studies with Forxiga.\n\nUrinary glucose excretion (glucuresis) induced by dapagliflozin is associated with caloric loss and \nreduction in weight. Inhibition of glucose and sodium co-transport by dapagliflozin is also associated \nwith mild diuresis and transient natriuresis.\n\nDapagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into \nperipheral tissues and is > 1,400 times more selective for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the major transporter \nin the gut responsible for glucose absorption.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nIncreases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in \nsubjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Approximately \n70 g of glucose was excreted in the urine per day (corresponding to 280 kcal/day) at a dapagliflozin \ndose of 10 mg/day in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks. Evidence of sustained \nglucose excretion was seen in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus given dapagliflozin 10 mg/day for \nup to 2 years.\n\nThis urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in osmotic diuresis and increases in \nurinary volume in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary volume increases in subjects with \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg were sustained at 12 weeks and amounted to \napproximately 375 mL/day. The increase in urinary volume was associated with a small and transient \nincrease in urinary sodium excretion that was not associated with changes in serum sodium \nconcentrations.\n\nUrinary uric acid excretion was also increased transiently (for 3-7 days) and accompanied by a \nsustained reduction in serum uric acid concentration. At 24 weeks, reductions in serum uric acid \nconcentrations ranged from -48.3 to -18.3 micromoles/L (-0.87 to -0.33 mg/dL).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nBoth improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are \nan integral part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFourteen double-blind, randomised, controlled clinical studies were conducted with 7,056 subjects \nwith type 2 diabetes to evaluate the glycaemic efficacy and safety of Forxiga; 4,737 subjects in these \n\n\n\n15\n\nstudies were treated with dapagliflozin. Twelve studies had a treatment period of 24 weeks duration, \n8 with long-term extensions ranging from 24 to 80 weeks (up to a total study duration of 104 weeks), \none study had a 28-week treatment period, and one study was 52 weeks in duration with long-term \nextensions of 52 and 104 weeks (total study duration of 208 weeks). Mean duration of diabetes ranged \nfrom 1.4 to 16.9 years. Fifty percent (50%) had mild renal impairment and 11% had moderate renal \nimpairment. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the subjects were men, 84% were White, 8% were Asian, \n4% were Black and 4% were of other racial groups. Eighty-one percent (81%) of the subjects had a \nbody mass index (BMI) \uf0b3 27. Furthermore, two 12-week, placebo-controlled studies were conducted \nin patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension.\n\nA cardiovascular outcomes study (DECLARE) was conducted with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared \nwith placebo in 17,160 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without established \ncardiovascular disease to evaluate the effect on cardiovascular and renal events.\n\nGlycaemic control\nMonotherapy\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 24-week duration (with an additional extension period) \nwas conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of monotherapy with Forxiga in subjects with \ninadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Once-daily treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in \nstatistically significant (p < 0.0001) reductions in HbA1c compared to placebo (Table 3).\n\nIn the extension period, HbA1c reductions were sustained through Week 102 (-0.61%, \nand -0.17% adjusted mean change from baseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively).\n\nTable 3.

The results showed a similar mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52, compared \nto glipizide, thus demonstrating non-inferiority (Table 4). At Week 104, adjusted mean change from \n\n\n\n16\n\nbaseline in HbA1c was -0.32% for dapagliflozin and -0.14% for glipizide. At Week 208, adjusted \nmean change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.10% for dapagliflozin and 0.20% for glipizide. At 52, \n104 and 208 weeks, a significantly lower proportion of subjects in the group treated with dapagliflozin \n(3.5%, 4.3% and 5.0%, respectively) experienced at least one event of hypoglycaemia compared to the \ngroup treated with glipizide (40.8%, 47.0% and 50.0%, respectively). The proportion of subjects \nremaining in the study at Week 104 and Week 208 was 56.2% and 39.7% for the group treated with \ndapagliflozin and 50.0% and 34.6% for the group treated with glipizide.\n\nTable 4.

At \nWeek 48 when added to sitagliptin (with or without metformin), the adjusted mean change from \nbaseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo was -0.30% and 0.38%, respectively. For the add-on to \nmetformin study, HbA1c reductions were sustained through Week 102 (-0.78% and 0.02% adjusted \nmean change from baseline for 10 mg and placebo, respectively). At Week 104 for insulin (with or \nwithout additional oral glucose-lowering medicinal products), the HbA1c reductions were -0.71% \nand -0.06% adjusted mean change from baseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. At \nWeeks 48 and 104, the insulin dose remained stable compared to baseline in subjects treated with \ndapagliflozin 10 mg at an average dose of 76 IU/day.

This effect was observed at Week 1 of \ntreatment and maintained in studies extended through Week 104.\n\nCombination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significantly \ngreater reductions in FPG at Week 28: -3.66 mmol/L (-65.8 mg/dL), compared to -2.73 mmol/L (-49.2 \nmg/dL) for dapagliflozin alone (p < 0.001) and -2.54 mmol/L (-45.8 mg/dL) for exenatide alone \n(p < 0.001).\n\nIn a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with \ndapagliflozin demonstrated reductions in FPG at Week 24: -1.19 mmol/L (-21.46 mg/dL) compared to \n-0.27 mmol/L (-4.87 mg/dL) for placebo (p=0.001).\n\nPost-prandial glucose\nTreatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to glimepiride resulted in statistically significant \nreductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose at 24 weeks that were maintained up to Week 48.\n\nTreatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to sitagliptin (with or without metformin) resulted in \nreductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose at 24 weeks that were maintained up to Week 48.\n\nCombination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significantly \ngreater reductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose at Week 28 compared to either medicinal product \nalone.\n\nBody weight\nDapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to metformin, glimepiride, metformin and a sulphonylurea, \nsitagliptin (with or without metformin) or insulin resulted in statistically significant body weight \nreduction at 24 weeks (p < 0.0001, Tables 5 and 6). These effects were sustained in longer-term \nstudies. At 48 weeks, the difference for dapagliflozin as add-on to sitagliptin (with or without \nmetformin) compared with placebo was -2.22 kg. At 102 weeks, the difference for dapagliflozin as \nadd-on to metformin compared with placebo, or as add-on to insulin compared with placebo was -2.14 \nand -2.88 kg, respectively.\n\nAs an add-on therapy to metformin in an active-controlled non-inferiority study, dapagliflozin resulted \nin a statistically significant body weight reduction compared with glipizide of -4.65 kg at 52 weeks \n(p < 0.0001, Table 4) that was sustained at 104 and 208 weeks (-5.06 kg and \u20134.38 kg, respectively).\n\nThe combination of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated significantly \ngreater weight reductions compared to either medicinal product alone (Table 9).\n\nA 24-week study in 182 diabetic subjects using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to evaluate \nbody composition demonstrated reductions with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin compared with \nplacebo plus metformin, respectively, in body weight and body fat mass as measured by DXA rather \nthan lean tissue or fluid loss. Treatment with Forxiga plus metformin showed a numerical decrease in \nvisceral adipose tissue compared with placebo plus metformin treatment in a magnetic resonance \nimaging substudy.\n\n\n\n22\n\nBlood pressure\nIn a pre-specified pooled analysis of 13 placebo-controlled studies, treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg \nresulted in a systolic blood pressure change from baseline of \u20133.7 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure \nof \u20131.8 mmHg versus \u20130.5 mmHg systolic and -0.5 mmHg diastolic blood pressure for placebo group \nat Week 24. Similar reductions were observed up to 104 weeks.\n\nCombination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in a \nsignificantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure at Week 28 (-4.3 mmHg) compared to \ndapagliflozin alone (-1.8 mmHg, p < 0.05) and prolonged-release exenatide alone (-1.2 mmHg, \np < 0.01).\n\nIn two 12-week, placebo-controlled studies a total of 1,062 patients with inadequately controlled \ntype 2 diabetes and hypertension (despite pre-existing stable treatment with an ACE-I or ARB in one \nstudy and an ACE-I or ARB plus one additional antihypertensive treatment in another study) were \ntreated with dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. At Week 12 for both studies, dapagliflozin 10 mg plus \nusual antidiabetic treatment provided improvement in HbA1c and decreased the placebo-corrected \nsystolic blood pressure on average by 3.1 and 4.3 mmHg, respectively.\n\nIn a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with \ndapagliflozin demonstrated reductions in seated systolic blood pressure at Week 24: -4.8 mmHg \ncompared to -1.7 mmHg for placebo (p < 0.05).\n\nGlycaemic control in patients with moderate renal impairment CKD 3A \n(eGFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)\nThe efficacy of dapagliflozin was assessed in a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR \u2265 45 \nto < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who had inadequate glycaemic control on usual care. Treatment with \ndapagliflozin resulted in reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with placebo (Table 10).\n\nTable 10.

All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and either at least two additional cardiovascular risk \nfactors (age \u2265 55 years in men or \u2265 60 years in women and one or more of dyslipidaemia, hypertension \nor current tobacco use) or established cardiovascular disease.\n\nOf 17,160 randomised patients, 6,974 (40.6%) had established cardiovascular disease and \n10,186 (59.4%) did not have established cardiovascular disease. 8,582 patients were randomised to \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and 8,578 to placebo, and were followed for a median of 4.2 years.\n\nThe mean age of the study population was 63.9 years, 37.4% were female. In total, 22.4% had had \ndiabetes for \u2264 5 years, mean duration of diabetes was 11.9 years. Mean HbA1c was 8.3% and mean \nBMI was 32.1 kg/m2. \n\nAt baseline, 10.0% of patients had a history of heart failure. Mean eGFR was 85.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, \n7.4% of patients had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 30.3% of patients had micro- or \nmacroalbuminuria (urine albumin to creatinine ratio [UACR] \u2265 30 to \u2264 300 mg/g or > 300 mg/g, \nrespectively).\n\nMost patients (98%) used one or more diabetic medications at baseline, including metformin (82%), \ninsulin (41%) and sulfonylurea (43%).\n\nThe primary endpoints were time to first event of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial \ninfarction or ischaemic stroke (MACE) and time to first event of the composite of hospitalisation for \nheart failure or cardiovascular death. The secondary endpoints were a renal composite endpoint and \nall-cause mortality.\n\nMajor adverse cardiovascular events\nDapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated non-inferiority versus placebo for the composite of cardiovascular \ndeath, myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke (one-sided p < 0.001).\n\nHeart failure or cardiovascular death\nDapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated superiority versus placebo in preventing the composite of \nhospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death (Figure 1). The difference in treatment effect \nwas driven by hospitalisation for heart failure, with no difference in cardiovascular death (Figure 2).\n\nThe treatment benefit of dapagliflozin over placebo was observed both in patients with and without \nestablished cardiovascular disease, with and without heart failure at baseline, and was consistent \nacross key subgroups, including age, gender, renal function (eGFR) and region.\n\n\n\n24\n\nFigure 1: Time to first occurrence of hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death\n\nPatients at risk is the number of patients at risk at the beginning of the period. \nHR=Hazard ratio CI=Confidence interval.\n\nResults on primary and secondary endpoints are displayed in Figure 2. Superiority of dapagliflozin \nover placebo was not demonstrated for MACE (p=0.172). The renal composite endpoint and all-cause \nmortality were therefore not tested as part of the confirmatory testing procedure.\n\nFigure 2: Treatment effects for the primary composite endpoints and their components, and the \nsecondary endpoints and components\n\nRenal composite endpoint defined as: sustained confirmed \u2265 40% decrease in eGFR to eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or \nend-stage renal disease (dialysis \u2265 90 days or kidney transplantation, sustained confirmed eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2) \nand/or renal or cardiovascular death.\n\n\n\n25\n\np-values are two-sided. p-values for the secondary endpoints and for single components are nominal.

The number of first events for the single components are the actual number of \nfirst events for each component and does not add up to the number of events in the composite endpoint.\nCI=confidence interval.\n\nNephropathy\nDapagliflozin reduced the incidence of events of the composite of confirmed sustained eGFR \ndecrease, end-stage renal disease, renal or cardiovascular death. The difference between groups was \ndriven by reductions in events of the renal components; sustained eGFR decrease, end-stage renal \ndisease and renal death (Figure 2).\n\nThe hazard ratio for time to nephropathy (sustained eGFR decrease, end-stage renal disease and renal \ndeath) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.43, 0.66) for dapagliflozin versus placebo.\n\nIn addition, dapagliflozin reduced the new onset of sustained albuminuria (hazard ratio 0.79 \n[95% CI 0.72, 0.87]) and led to greater regression of macroalbuminuria (hazard ratio 1.82 \n[95% CI 1.51, 2.20]) compared with placebo.\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\nDapagliflozin as an adjunct to adjustable insulin was studied in two 24-week randomised, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled clinical studies with a 28-week extension to evaluate the efficacy and safety \nin adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control (defined as \nHbA1c \u2265 7.5%) on insulin alone. Following an 8-week lead-in period to optimise each patient\u2019s \ndiabetes management (glycaemic control including hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, diet and \nexercise patterns), a total of 1,646 patients with HbA1c \u2265 7.5% and \u2264 10.5% were randomised to 5 mg \ndapagliflozin once daily, 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily or placebo once daily. Throughout the study, \ninsulin dose was adjusted as deemed appropriate. \n\nGlycaemic control\nAt Week 24, treatment with dapagliflozin once daily provided statistically significant improvements in \nHbA1c compared with placebo (Table 11). This finding was consistent across subgroups. At Week 52, \nadjusted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c relative to placebo were -0.33% and -0.20% for \npatients treated with dapagliflozin 5 mg, in the two studies, respectively. Treatment with dapagliflozin \nwas not associated with an increase in percentage of patients with hypoglycaemic events compared \nwith placebo. The number of patients with severe hypoglycaemia was balanced across treatment \ngroups (6.9% and 7.5% at Week 24 in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and placebo groups, respectively).\n\nThe percentage of patients achieving \u2265 0.5% reductions in HbA1c without severe hypoglycaemia was \nsignificantly higher in patients treated with dapagliflozin compared with placebo (Table 11).\n\nTable 11.

This increase was not accompanied \nby any increase in the percentage of 24-hour glucose readings < 70 mg/dL.\n\nInsulin dose\nStatistically significant (p < 0.0001) differences in percent reduction of total insulin dose from \nbaseline for dapagliflozin 5 mg relative to placebo at Week 24 were -8.80% and -10.78% in the two \nstudies, respectively.\n\nBody weight\nStatistically significant reductions in body weight were demonstrated for dapagliflozin compared with \nplacebo (Table 11). Patients treated with dapagliflozin exhibited continuous weight loss over the \n24-week period. At Week 52, the adjusted mean changes in body weight from baseline for \ndapagliflozin 5 mg relative to placebo were -2.56 kg and -3.50 kg, in the two studies, respectively.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ndapagliflozin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of type 2 diabetes \nmellitus and type 1 diabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nDapagliflozin was rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration. Maximum dapagliflozin plasma \nconcentrations (Cmax) were usually attained within 2 hours after administration in the fasted state. \nGeometric mean steady-state dapagliflozin Cmax and AUC\u03c4 values following once daily 10 mg doses of \ndapagliflozin were 158 ng/mL and 628 ng h/mL, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability of \ndapagliflozin following the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78%. Administration with a high-fat \nmeal decreased dapagliflozin Cmax by up to 50% and prolonged Tmax by approximately 1 hour, but did \nnot alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. These changes are not considered to be clinically \nmeaningful. Hence, Forxiga can be administered with or without food.\n\n\n\n27\n\nDistribution\nDapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding was not altered in various disease \nstates (e.g. renal or hepatic impairment). The mean steady-state volume of distribution of dapagliflozin \nwas 118 liters.\n\nBiotransformation\nDapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is \nan inactive metabolite. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide or other metabolites do not contribute to the \nglucose-lowering effects. The formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, an \nenzyme present in the liver and kidney, and CYP-mediated metabolism was a minor clearance \npathway in humans.\n\nElimination\nThe mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for dapagliflozin was 12.9 hours following a single oral dose \nof dapagliflozin 10 mg to healthy subjects. The mean total systemic clearance of dapagliflozin \nadministered intravenously was 207 mL/min. Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are primarily \neliminated via urinary excretion with less than 2% as unchanged dapagliflozin. After administration of \na 50 mg [14C]-dapagliflozin dose, 96% was recovered, 75% in urine and 21% in faeces. In faeces, \napproximately 15% of the dose was excreted as parent drug.\n\nLinearity\nDapagliflozin exposure increased proportional to the increment in dapagliflozin dose over the range of \n0.1 to 500 mg and its pharmacokinetics did not change with time upon repeated daily dosing for up to \n24 weeks.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nAt steady-state (20 mg once-daily dapagliflozin for 7 days), subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \nmild, moderate or severe renal impairment (as determined by iohexol plasma clearance) had mean \nsystemic exposures of dapagliflozin of 32%, 60% and 87% higher, respectively, than those of subjects \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. The steady-state 24-hour urinary glucose \nexcretion was highly dependent on renal function and 85, 52, 18 and 11 g of glucose/day was excreted \nby subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function or mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment, respectively. The impact of haemodialysis on dapagliflozin exposure is not known.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), mean Cmax and \nAUC of dapagliflozin were up to 12% and 36% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched \ncontrol subjects. These differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful. In subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) mean Cmax and AUC of dapagliflozin were 40% and \n67% higher than matched healthy controls, respectively.\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nThere is no clinically meaningful increase in exposure based on age alone in subjects up to \n70 years old. However, an increased exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function can be \nexpected. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding exposure in patients \n> 70 years old.\n\nPaediatric population\nPharmacokinetics in the paediatric population have not been studied.\n\nGender\nThe mean dapagliflozin AUCss in females was estimated to be about 22% higher than in males.\n\nRace\nThere were no clinically relevant differences in systemic exposures between White, Black or Asian \nraces.\n\n\n\n28\n\nBody weight\nDapagliflozin exposure was found to decrease with increased weight. Consequently, low-weight \npatients may have somewhat increased exposure and patients with high weight somewhat decreased \nexposure. However, the differences in exposure were not considered clinically meaningful.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and fertility. Dapagliflozin \ndid not induce tumours in either mice or rats at any of the doses evaluated in two-year carcinogenicity \nstudies.\n\nReproductive and developmental toxicity\nDirect administration of dapagliflozin to weanling juvenile rats and indirect exposure during late \npregnancy (time periods corresponding to the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with respect to \nhuman renal maturation) and lactation are each associated with increased incidence and/or severity of \nrenal pelvic and tubular dilatations in progeny.\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study, when dapagliflozin was dosed directly to young rats from postnatal day 21 \nuntil postnatal day 90, renal pelvic and tubular dilatations were reported at all dose levels; pup \nexposures at the lowest dose tested were \u2265 15 times the maximum recommended human dose. These \nfindings were associated with dose-related increases in kidney weight and macroscopic kidney \nenlargement observed at all doses. The renal pelvic and tubular dilatations observed in juvenile \nanimals did not fully reverse within the approximate 1-month recovery period.\n\nIn a separate study of pre- and postnatal development, maternal rats were dosed from gestation day 6 \nthrough postnatal day 21, and pups were indirectly exposed in utero and throughout lactation. (A \nsatellite study was conducted to assess dapagliflozin exposures in milk and pups.) Increased incidence \nor severity of renal pelvic dilatation was observed in adult offspring of treated dams, although only at \nthe highest dose tested (associated maternal and pup dapagliflozin exposures were 1,415 times and \n137 times, respectively, the human values at the maximum recommended human dose). Additional \ndevelopmental toxicity was limited to dose-related reductions in pup body weights, and observed only \nat doses \u2265 15 mg/kg/day (associated with pup exposures that are \u2265 29 times the human values at the \nmaximum recommended human dose). Maternal toxicity was evident only at the highest dose tested, \nand limited to transient reductions in body weight and food consumption at dose. The no observed \nadverse effect level (NOAEL) for developmental toxicity, the lowest dose tested, is associated with a \nmaternal systemic exposure multiple that is approximately 19 times the human value at the maximum \nrecommended human dose.\n\nIn additional studies of embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits, dapagliflozin was administered \nfor intervals coinciding with the major periods of organogenesis in each species. Neither maternal nor \ndevelopmental toxicities were observed in rabbits at any dose tested; the highest dose tested is \nassociated with a systemic exposure multiple of approximately 1,191 times the maximum \nrecommended human dose. In rats, dapagliflozin was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic at \nexposures up to 1,441 times the maximum recommended human dose.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nForxiga is indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as \nan adjunct to diet and exercise\n- as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance.\n- in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFor study results with respect to combination of therapies, effects on glycaemic control and\ncardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nThe recommended dose is 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily.\n\nWhen dapagliflozin is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, such as a \nsulphonylurea, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be considered to reduce the risk of \nhypoglycaemia (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nForxiga should not be initiated in patients with a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min and \nshould be discontinued at GFR persistently below 45 mL/min (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nNo dose adjustment is required based on renal function.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended. If well tolerated, the dose \nmay be increased to 10 mg (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\n\n\n32\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nIn general, no dose adjustment is recommended based on age. Renal function and risk of volume \ndepletion should be taken into account (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin in children aged 0 to < 18 years have not yet been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nForxiga can be taken orally once daily at any time of day with or without food. Tablets are to be \nswallowed whole.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRenal impairment\nThe glycaemic efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal function, and efficacy is reduced in \npatients who have moderate renal impairment and is likely absent in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (see section 4.2). In subjects with moderate renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min), a \nhigher proportion of subjects treated with dapagliflozin had adverse reactions of increase in creatinine, \nphosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypotension, compared with placebo.\n\nForxiga should not be initiated in patients with a GFR < 60 mL/min and should be discontinued at \nGFR persistently below 45 mL/min. Forxiga has not been studied in severe renal impairment \n(GFR < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n\nMonitoring of renal function is recommended as follows:\n\u2022 Prior to initiation of dapagliflozin and at least yearly, thereafter (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and \n\n5.2).\n\u2022 Prior to initiation of concomitant medicinal products that may reduce renal function and \n\nperiodically thereafter.\n\u2022 For renal function with GFR < 60 mL/min, at least 2 to 4 times per year.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThere is limited experience in clinical studies in patients with hepatic impairment. Dapagliflozin \nexposure is increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nUse in patients at risk for volume depletion and/or hypotension\nDue to its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin increases diuresis which may lead to the modest \ndecrease in blood pressure observed in clinical studies (see section 5.1). It may be more pronounced in \npatients with very high blood glucose concentrations.\n\nCaution should be exercised in patients for whom a dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure \ncould pose a risk, such as patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or \nelderly patients.\n\nIn case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), \ncareful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, \nlaboratory tests including haematocrit and electrolytes) is recommended. Temporary interruption of \ntreatment with dapagliflozin is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until the \ndepletion is corrected (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n33\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nSodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with \nincreased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Patients who may be at higher risk of DKA include \npatients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g. type 1 diabetes patients, type 2 diabetes patients \nwith low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or patients with a history of \npancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or severe dehydration, patients \nfor whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin requirements due to acute \nmedical illness, surgery or alcohol abuse.\n\nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual \nfatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms \noccur, regardless of blood glucose level.\n\nBefore initiating dapagliflozin, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should \nbe considered.\n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of \nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with dapagliflozin may be restarted when the \nketone values are normal and the patient\u2019s condition has stabilised.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nRare cases of DKA, including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been reported in patients treated \nwith SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. In a number of cases, the presentation of the condition \nwas atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL).\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, dapagliflozin treatment should be stopped \nimmediately.\n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients experiencing a DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus studies with dapagliflozin, DKA was reported with common frequency. \nDapagliflozin 10 mg should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\nPostmarketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier\u2019s gangrene) have \nbeen reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors (see section 4.8). This is a rare but\nserious and potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic \ntreatment.\n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier\u2019s \ngangrene is suspected, Forxiga should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics and \nsurgical debridement) should be instituted.\n\nUrinary tract infections\nUrinary glucose excretion may be associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection; \ntherefore, temporary interruption of dapagliflozin should be considered when treating pyelonephritis \nor urosepsis.\n\n\n\n34\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nElderly patients may be at a greater risk for volume depletion and are more likely to be treated with \ndiuretics.\n\nElderly patients are more likely to have impaired renal function, and/or to be treated with \nanti-hypertensive medicinal products that may cause changes in renal function such as \nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB). \nThe same recommendations for renal function apply to elderly patients as to all patients (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nCardiac failure\nThere is no experience in clinical studies with dapagliflozin in NYHA class IV.\n\nLower limb amputations\nAn increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in ongoing \nlong-term, clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class \neffect. Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot care.\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\nDue to its mechanism of action, patients taking Forxiga will test positive for glucose in their urine.\n\nLactose\nThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\nDiuretics\nDapagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of \ndehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower \ndose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when \nused in combination with dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see sections 4.2 and \n4.8).\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\nThe metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by \nUDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9).\n\nIn in vitro studies, dapagliflozin neither inhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. \nTherefore, dapagliflozin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered medicinal \nproducts that are metabolised by these enzymes.\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on dapagliflozin\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, suggest that the \npharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin are not altered by metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, \nvoglibose, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, or simvastatin.\n\nFollowing coadministration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various active transporters \nand drug-metabolising enzymes) a 22% decrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure (AUC) was \nobserved, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24-hour urinary glucose excretion. No dose \nadjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, phenobarbital) is not expected.\n\n\n\n35\n\nFollowing coadministration of dapagliflozin with mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55% \nincrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on \n24-hour urinary glucose excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended.\n\nEffect of dapagliflozin on other medicinal products\nIn interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, dapagliflozin \ndid not alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, \nhydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, digoxin (a P-gp substrate) or warfarin (S-warfarin, a \nCYP2C9 substrate), or the anticoagulatory effects of warfarin as measured by INR. Combination of a \nsingle dose of dapagliflozin 20 mg and simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19% increase in \nAUC of simvastatin and 31% increase in AUC of simvastatin acid. The increase in simvastatin and \nsimvastatin acid exposures are not considered clinically relevant.\n\nInterference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay\nMonitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are \nunreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use of alternative \nmethods to monitor glycaemic control is advised.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of dapagliflozin in pregnant women. Studies in rats have shown \ntoxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of \nhuman pregnancy (see section 5.3). Therefore, the use of dapagliflozin is not recommended during the \nsecond and third trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nWhen pregnancy is detected, treatment with dapagliflozin should be discontinued.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether dapagliflozin and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of dapagliflozin/metabolites in \nmilk, as well as pharmacologically-mediated effects in nursing offspring (see section 5.3). A risk to \nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Dapagliflozin should not be used while breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of dapagliflozin on fertility in humans has not been studied. In male and female rats, \ndapagliflozin showed no effects on fertility at any dose tested.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nForxiga has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \nalerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when dapagliflozin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea \nor insulin.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nIn the clinical studies in type 2 diabetes, more than 15,000 patients have been treated with \ndapagliflozin.\n\n\n\n36\n\nThe primary assessment of safety and tolerability was conducted in a pre-specified pooled analysis of \n13 short-term (up to 24 weeks) placebo-controlled studies with 2,360 subjects treated with \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and 2,295 treated with placebo.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study (see section 5.1), 8,574 patients received \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and 8,569 received placebo for a median exposure time of 48 months. In total, \nthere were 30,623 patient-years of exposure to dapagliflozin.\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions across the clinical studies were genital infections.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified in the placebo-controlled clinical studies and \npostmarketing surveillance.

Rash includes the following preferred \nterms, listed in order of frequency in clinical studies: rash, rash generalised, rash pruritic, rash macular, rash \nmaculo-papular, rash pustular, rash vesicular, and rash erythematous. In active- and placebo-controlled clinical \nstudies (dapagliflozin, N=5936, All control, N=3403), the frequency of rash was similar for dapagliflozin \n(1.4%) and all control (1.4%), respectively.\n\nkReported in the cardiovascular outcomes study in patients with type 2 diabetes. Frequency is based on annual \nrate.\n\n*Reported in \u2265 2% of subjects and \u2265 1% more and at least 3 more subjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg \ncompared to placebo.\n\n**Reported by the investigator as possibly related, probably related or related to study treatment and reported in \n\u2265 0.2% of subjects and \u2265 0.1% more and at least 3 more subjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared to \nplacebo.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nClinical studies in type 2 diabetes mellitus\nVulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infections\nIn the 13-study safety pool, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and related genital infections were reported in \n5.5% and 0.6% of subjects who received dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. Most \ninfections were mild to moderate, and subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment and \nrarely resulted in discontinuation from dapagliflozin treatment. These infections were more frequent in \nfemales (8.4% and 1.2% for dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively), and subjects with a prior history \nwere more likely to have a recurrent infection.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, the number of patients with serious adverse events \nof genital infections were few and balanced: 2 patients in each of the dapagliflozin and placebo \ngroups.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)\nCases of Fournier\u2019s gangrene have been reported postmarketing in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, \nincluding dapagliflozin (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study with 17,160 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and a \nmedian exposure time of 48 months, a total of 6 cases of Fournier\u2019s gangrene were reported, one in the \ndapagliflozin-treated group and 5 in the placebo group.\n\nHypoglycaemia\nThe frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the type of background therapy used in each study.\n\n\n\n38\n\nFor studies of dapagliflozin in monotherapy, as add-on to metformin or as add-on to sitagliptin (with \nor without metformin), the frequency of minor episodes of hypoglycaemia was similar (< 5%) \nbetween treatment groups, including placebo up to 102 weeks of treatment. Across all studies, major \nevents of hypoglycaemia were uncommon and comparable between the groups treated with \ndapagliflozin or placebo. Studies with add-on sulphonylurea and add-on insulin therapies had higher \nrates of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.5).\n\nIn an add-on to glimepiride study, at Weeks 24 and 48, minor episodes of hypoglycaemia were \nreported more frequently in the group treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus glimepiride (6.0% and \n7.9%, respectively) than in the placebo plus glimepiride group (2.1% and 2.1%, respectively).\n\nIn an add-on to insulin study, episodes of major hypoglycaemia were reported in 0.5% and 1.0% of \nsubjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus insulin at Weeks 24 and 104, respectively, and in 0.5% \nof subjects treated with placebo plus insulin groups at Weeks 24 and 104. At Weeks 24 and 104, minor \nepisodes of hypoglycaemia were reported, respectively, in 40.3% and 53.1% of subjects who received \ndapagliflozin 10 mg plus insulin and in 34.0% and 41.6% of the subjects who received placebo plus \ninsulin.\n\nIn an add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea study, up to 24 weeks, no episodes of major \nhypoglycaemia were reported. Minor episodes of hypoglycaemia were reported in 12.8% of subjects \nwho received dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin and a sulphonylurea and in 3.7% of subjects who \nreceived placebo plus metformin and a sulphonylurea.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, no increased risk of major hypoglycaemia was \nobserved with dapagliflozin therapy compared with placebo. Major events of hypoglycaemia were \nreported in 58 (0.7%) patients treated with dapagliflozin and 83 (1.0%) patients treated with placebo.\n\nVolume depletion\nIn the 13-study safety pool, reactions suggestive of volume depletion (including, reports of \ndehydration, hypovolaemia or hypotension) were reported in 1.1% and 0.7% of subjects who received \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively; serious reactions occurred in < 0.2% of subjects \nbalanced between dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, the numbers of patients with events suggestive of \nvolume depletion were balanced between treatment groups: 213 (2.5%) and 207 (2.4%) in the \ndapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (0.9%) and \n70 (0.8%) in the dapagliflozin and placebo group, respectively. Events were generally balanced \nbetween treatment groups across subgroups of age, diuretic use, blood pressure and ACE-I/ARB use. \nIn patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline, there were 19 events of serious adverse \nevents suggestive of volume depletion in the dapagliflozin group and 13 events in the placebo group.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, with a median exposure time of 48 months, events \nof DKA were reported in 27 patients in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients in the placebo \ngroup. The events occurred evenly distributed over the study period. Of the 27 patients with DKA \nevents in the dapagliflozin group, 22 had concomitant insulin treatment at the time of the event. \nPrecipitating factors for DKA were as expected in a type 2 diabetes mellitus population (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nUrinary tract infections\nIn the 13-study safety pool, urinary tract infections were more frequently reported for \ndapagliflozin 10 mg compared to placebo (4.7% versus 3.5%, respectively; see section 4.4). Most \ninfections were mild to moderate, and subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment and \nrarely resulted in discontinuation from dapagliflozin treatment. These infections were more frequent in \nfemales, and subjects with a prior history were more likely to have a recurrent infection.\n\n\n\n39\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, serious events of urinary tract infections were \nreported less frequently for dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo, 79 (0.9%) events versus \n109 (1.3%) events, respectively.\n\nIncreased creatinine\nAdverse reactions related to increased creatinine were grouped (e.g. decreased renal creatinine \nclearance, renal impairment, increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration rate). This \ngrouping of reactions was reported in 3.2% and 1.8% of patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg \nand placebo, respectively. In patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (baseline \neGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) this grouping of reactions were reported in 1.3% and 0.8% of patients \nwho received dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. These reactions were more common in \npatients with baseline eGFR \u2265 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (18.5% dapagliflozin 10 mg versus 9.3% \nplacebo).\n\nFurther evaluation of patients who had renal-related adverse events showed that most had serum \ncreatinine changes of \u2264 0.5 mg/dL from baseline. The increases in creatinine were generally transient \nduring continuous treatment or reversible after discontinuation of treatment.\n\nIn the dapagliflozin cardiovascular outcomes study, including elderly patients and patients with renal \nimpairment (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), eGFR decreased over time in both treatment groups. \nAt 1 year, mean eGFR was slightly lower, and at 4 years, mean eGFR was slightly higher in the \ndapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDapagliflozin did not show any toxicity in healthy subjects at single oral doses up to 500 mg (50 times \nthe maximum recommended human dose). These subjects had detectable glucose in the urine for a \ndose-related period of time (at least 5 days for the 500 mg dose), with no reports of dehydration, \nhypotension or electrolyte imbalance, and with no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval. The \nincidence of hypoglycaemia was similar to placebo. In clinical studies where once-daily doses of up to \n100 mg (10 times the maximum recommended human dose) were administered for 2 weeks in healthy \nsubjects and type 2 diabetes subjects, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was slightly higher than placebo \nand was not dose-related. Rates of adverse events including dehydration or hypotension were similar \nto placebo, and there were no clinically meaningful dose-related changes in laboratory parameters, \nincluding serum electrolytes and biomarkers of renal function.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the \npatient\u2019s clinical status. The removal of dapagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) \ninhibitors, ATC code: A10BK01\n\nMechanism of action\nDapagliflozin is a highly potent (Ki: 0.55 nM), selective and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2.\n\n\n\n40\n\nThe SGLT2 is selectively expressed in the kidney with no expression detected in more than 70 other \ntissues including liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, breast, bladder and brain. SGLT2 is the \npredominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into \nthe circulation. Despite the presence of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, reabsorption of filtered \nglucose continues. Dapagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels by \nreducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. This glucose excretion \n(glucuretic effect) is observed after the first dose, is continuous over the 24-hour dosing interval and is \nsustained for the duration of treatment. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this \nmechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and GFR. Dapagliflozin does not \nimpair normal endogenous glucose production in response to hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin acts \nindependently of insulin secretion and insulin action. Improvement in homeostasis model assessment \nfor beta cell function (HOMA beta-cell) has been observed in clinical studies with Forxiga.\n\nUrinary glucose excretion (glucuresis) induced by dapagliflozin is associated with caloric loss and \nreduction in weight. Inhibition of glucose and sodium co-transport by dapagliflozin is also associated \nwith mild diuresis and transient natriuresis.\n\nDapagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into \nperipheral tissues and is > 1,400 times more selective for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the major transporter \nin the gut responsible for glucose absorption.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nIncreases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in \nsubjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Approximately \n70 g of glucose was excreted in the urine per day (corresponding to 280 kcal/day) at a dapagliflozin \ndose of 10 mg/day in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks. Evidence of sustained \nglucose excretion was seen in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus given dapagliflozin 10 mg/day for \nup to 2 years.\n\nThis urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in osmotic diuresis and increases in \nurinary volume in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary volume increases in subjects with \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg were sustained at 12 weeks and amounted to \napproximately 375 mL/day. The increase in urinary volume was associated with a small and transient \nincrease in urinary sodium excretion that was not associated with changes in serum sodium \nconcentrations.\n\nUrinary uric acid excretion was also increased transiently (for 3-7 days) and accompanied by a \nsustained reduction in serum uric acid concentration. At 24 weeks, reductions in serum uric acid \nconcentrations ranged from -48.3 to -18.3 micromoles/L (-0.87 to -0.33 mg/dL).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nBoth improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are \nan integral part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFourteen double-blind, randomised, controlled clinical studies were conducted with 7,056 subjects \nwith type 2 diabetes to evaluate the glycaemic efficacy and safety of Forxiga; 4,737 subjects in these \nstudies were treated with dapagliflozin. Twelve studies had a treatment period of 24 weeks duration, \n8 with long-term extensions ranging from 24 to 80 weeks (up to a total study duration of 104 weeks), \none study had a 28-week treatment period, and one study was 52 weeks in duration with long-term \nextensions of 52 and 104 weeks (total study duration of 208 weeks). Mean duration of diabetes ranged \nfrom 1.4 to 16.9 years. Fifty percent (50%) had mild renal impairment and 11% had moderate renal \nimpairment. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the subjects were men, 84% were White, 8% were Asian, \n4% were Black and 4% were of other racial groups. Eighty-one percent (81%) of the subjects had a \nbody mass index (BMI) \uf0b3 27. Furthermore, two 12-week, placebo-controlled studies were conducted \nin patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension.\n\n\n\n41\n\nA cardiovascular outcomes study (DECLARE) was conducted with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared \nwith placebo in 17,160 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without established \ncardiovascular disease to evaluate the effect on cardiovascular and renal events.\n\nGlycaemic control\nMonotherapy\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 24-week duration (with an additional extension period) \nwas conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of monotherapy with Forxiga in subjects with \ninadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Once-daily treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in \nstatistically significant (p < 0.0001) reductions in HbA1c compared to placebo (Table 2).\n\nIn the extension period, HbA1c reductions were sustained through Week 102 (-0.61%, \nand -0.17% adjusted mean change from baseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively).\n\nTable 2.

The results showed a similar mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52, compared \nto glipizide, thus demonstrating non-inferiority (Table 3). At Week 104, adjusted mean change from \nbaseline in HbA1c was -0.32% for dapagliflozin and -0.14% for glipizide. At Week 208, adjusted \nmean change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.10% for dapagliflozin and 0.20% for glipizide. At 52, \n104 and 208 weeks, a significantly lower proportion of subjects in the group treated with dapagliflozin \n(3.5%, 4.3% and 5.0%, respectively) experienced at least one event of hypoglycaemia compared to the \ngroup treated with glipizide (40.8%, 47.0% and 50.0%, respectively). The proportion of subjects \nremaining in the study at Week 104 and Week 208 was 56.2% and 39.7% for the group treated with \ndapagliflozin and 50.0% and 34.6% for the group treated with glipizide.\n\n\n\n42\n\nTable 3.

At \nWeek 48 when added to sitagliptin (with or without metformin), the adjusted mean change from \nbaseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo was -0.30% and 0.38%, respectively. For the add-on to \nmetformin study, HbA1c reductions were sustained through Week 102 (-0.78% and 0.02% adjusted \nmean change from baseline for 10 mg and placebo, respectively). At Week 104 for insulin (with or \nwithout additional oral glucose-lowering medicinal products), the HbA1c reductions were -0.71% \nand -0.06% adjusted mean change from baseline for dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. At \nWeeks 48 and 104, the insulin dose remained stable compared to baseline in subjects treated with \ndapagliflozin 10 mg at an average dose of 76 IU/day. In the placebo group there was a mean increase \nof 10.5 IU/day and 18.3 IU/day from baseline (mean average dose of 84 and 92 IU/day) at Weeks 48 \nand 104, respectively.

This effect was observed at Week 1 of \ntreatment and maintained in studies extended through Week 104.\n\nCombination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significantly \ngreater reductions in FPG at Week 28: -3.66 mmol/L (-65.8 mg/dL), compared to -2.73 mmol/L\n(-49.2 mg/dL) for dapagliflozin alone (p < 0.001) and -2.54 mmol/L (-45.8 mg/dL) for exenatide alone \n(p < 0.001).\n\nIn a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with \ndapagliflozin demonstrated reductions in FPG at Week 24: -1.19 mmol/L (-21.46 mg/dL) compared to \n-0.27 mmol/L (-4.87 mg/dL) for placebo (p=0.001).\n\nPost-prandial glucose\nTreatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to glimepiride resulted in statistically significant \nreductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose at 24 weeks that were maintained up to Week 48.\n\nTreatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to sitagliptin (with or without metformin) resulted in \nreductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose at 24 weeks that were maintained up to Week 48.\n\nCombination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significantly \ngreater reductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose at Week 28 compared to either medicinal product \nalone.\n\nBody weight\nDapagliflozin 10 mg as an add-on to metformin, glimepiride, metformin and a sulphonylurea, \nsitagliptin (with or without metformin) or insulin resulted in statistically significant body weight \nreduction at 24 weeks (p < 0.0001, Tables 4 and 5). These effects were sustained in longer-term \nstudies. At 48 weeks, the difference for dapagliflozin as add-on to sitagliptin (with or without \nmetformin) compared with placebo was -2.22 kg. At 102 weeks, the difference for dapagliflozin as \nadd-on to metformin compared with placebo, or as add-on to insulin compared with placebo was -2.14 \nand -2.88 kg, respectively.\n\nAs an add-on therapy to metformin in an active-controlled non-inferiority study, dapagliflozin resulted \nin a statistically significant body weight reduction compared with glipizide of -4.65 kg at 52 weeks \n(p < 0.0001, Table 3) that was sustained at 104 and 208 weeks (-5.06 kg and \u20134.38 kg, respectively).\n\nThe combination of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated significantly \ngreater weight reductions compared to either medicinal product alone (Table 8).\n\nA 24-week study in 182 diabetic subjects using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to evaluate \nbody composition demonstrated reductions with dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin compared with \nplacebo plus metformin, respectively, in body weight and body fat mass as measured by DXA rather \nthan lean tissue or fluid loss. Treatment with Forxiga plus metformin showed a numerical decrease in \nvisceral adipose tissue compared with placebo plus metformin treatment in a magnetic resonance \nimaging substudy.\n\n\n\n48\n\nBlood pressure\nIn a pre-specified pooled analysis of 13 placebo-controlled studies, treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg \nresulted in a systolic blood pressure change from baseline of \u20133.7 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure \nof \u20131.8 mmHg versus \u20130.5 mmHg systolic and -0.5 mmHg diastolic blood pressure for placebo group \nat Week 24. Similar reductions were observed up to 104 weeks.\n\nCombination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged-release exenatide resulted in a \nsignificantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure at Week 28 (-4.3 mmHg) compared to \ndapagliflozin alone (-1.8 mmHg, p < 0.05) and prolonged-release exenatide alone (-1.2 mmHg, \np < 0.01).\n\nIn two 12-week, placebo-controlled studies a total of 1,062 patients with inadequately controlled \ntype 2 diabetes and hypertension (despite pre-existing stable treatment with an ACE-I or ARB in one \nstudy and an ACE-I or ARB plus one additional antihypertensive treatment in another study) were \ntreated with dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. At Week 12 for both studies, dapagliflozin 10 mg plus \nusual antidiabetic treatment provided improvement in HbA1c and decreased the placebo-corrected \nsystolic blood pressure on average by 3.1 and 4.3 mmHg, respectively.\n\nIn a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with \ndapagliflozin demonstrated reductions in seated systolic blood pressure at Week 24: -4.8 mmHg \ncompared to -1.7 mmHg for placebo (p < 0.05).\n\nGlycaemic control in patients with moderate renal impairment CKD 3A \n(eGFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)\nThe efficacy of dapagliflozin was assessed in a dedicated study in diabetic patients with an eGFR \u2265 45 \nto < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who had inadequate glycaemic control on usual care. Treatment with \ndapagliflozin resulted in reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with placebo (Table 9).\n\nTable 9.

All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and either at least two additional cardiovascular risk \nfactors (age \u2265 55 years in men or \u2265 60 years in women and one or more of dyslipidaemia, hypertension \nor current tobacco use) or established cardiovascular disease.\n\nOf 17,160 randomised patients, 6,974 (40.6%) had established cardiovascular disease and \n10,186 (59.4%) did not have established cardiovascular disease. 8,582 patients were randomised to \ndapagliflozin 10 mg and 8,578 to placebo, and were followed for a median of 4.2 years.\n\nThe mean age of the study population was 63.9 years, 37.4% were female. In total, 22.4% had had \ndiabetes for \u2264 5 years, mean duration of diabetes was 11.9 years. Mean HbA1c was 8.3% and mean \nBMI was 32.1 kg/m2.\n\nAt baseline, 10.0% of patients had a history of heart failure. Mean eGFR was 85.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, \n7.4% of patients had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 30.3% of patients had micro- or \nmacroalbuminuria (urine albumin to creatinine ratio [UACR] \u2265 30 to \u2264 300 mg/g or > 300 mg/g, \nrespectively).\n\nMost patients (98%) used one or more diabetic medications at baseline, including metformin (82%), \ninsulin (41%) and sulfonylurea (43%).\n\nThe primary endpoints were time to first event of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial \ninfarction or ischaemic stroke (MACE) and time to first event of the composite of hospitalisation for \nheart failure or cardiovascular death. The secondary endpoints were a renal composite endpoint and \nall-cause mortality.\n\nMajor adverse cardiovascular events\nDapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated non-inferiority versus placebo for the composite of cardiovascular \ndeath, myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke (one-sided p < 0.001).\n\nHeart failure or cardiovascular death\nDapagliflozin 10 mg demonstrated superiority versus placebo in preventing the composite of \nhospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death (Figure 1). The difference in treatment effect \nwas driven by hospitalisation for heart failure, with no difference in cardiovascular death (Figure 2).\n\nThe treatment benefit of dapagliflozin over placebo was observed both in patients with and without \nestablished cardiovascular disease, with and without heart failure at baseline, and was consistent \nacross key subgroups, including age, gender, renal function (eGFR) and region.\n\n\n\n50\n\nFigure 1: Time to first occurrence of hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death\n\nPatients at risk is the number of patients at risk at the beginning of the period. \nHR=Hazard ratio CI=Confidence interval.\n\nResults on primary and secondary endpoints are displayed in Figure 2. Superiority of dapagliflozin \nover placebo was not demonstrated for MACE (p=0.172). The renal composite endpoint and all-cause \nmortality were therefore not tested as part of the confirmatory testing procedure.\n\nFigure 2: Treatment effects for the primary composite endpoints and their components, and the \nsecondary endpoints and components\n\nRenal composite endpoint defined as: sustained confirmed \u2265 40% decrease in eGFR to eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or \nend-stage renal disease (dialysis \u2265 90 days or kidney transplantation, sustained confirmed eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2) \nand/or renal or cardiovascular death.\n\n\n\n51\n\np-values are two-sided. p-values for the secondary endpoints and for single components are nominal.

The number of first events for the single components are the actual number of \nfirst events for each component and does not add up to the number of events in the composite endpoint.\nCI=confidence interval.\n\nNephropathy\nDapagliflozin reduced the incidence of events of the composite of confirmed sustained eGFR \ndecrease, end-stage renal disease, renal or cardiovascular death. The difference between groups was \ndriven by reductions in events of the renal components; sustained eGFR decrease, end-stage renal \ndisease and renal death (Figure 2).\n\nThe hazard ratio for time to nephropathy (sustained eGFR decrease, end-stage renal disease and renal \ndeath) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.43, 0.66) for dapagliflozin versus placebo.\n\nIn addition, dapagliflozin reduced the new onset of sustained albuminuria (hazard ratio 0.79 \n[95% CI 0.72, 0.87]) and led to greater regression of macroalbuminuria (hazard ratio 1.82 \n[95% CI 1.51, 2.20]) compared with placebo.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ndapagliflozin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of type 2 diabetes \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nDapagliflozin was rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration. Maximum dapagliflozin plasma \nconcentrations (Cmax) were usually attained within 2 hours after administration in the fasted state. \nGeometric mean steady-state dapagliflozin Cmax and AUC\u03c4 values following once daily 10 mg doses of \ndapagliflozin were 158 ng/mL and 628 ng h/mL, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability of \ndapagliflozin following the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78%. Administration with a high-fat \nmeal decreased dapagliflozin Cmax by up to 50% and prolonged Tmax by approximately 1 hour, but did \nnot alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. These changes are not considered to be clinically \nmeaningful. Hence, Forxiga can be administered with or without food.\n\nDistribution\nDapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding was not altered in various disease \nstates (e.g. renal or hepatic impairment). The mean steady-state volume of distribution of dapagliflozin \nwas 118 liters.\n\nBiotransformation\nDapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is \nan inactive metabolite. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide or other metabolites do not contribute to the \nglucose-lowering effects. The formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, an \nenzyme present in the liver and kidney, and CYP-mediated metabolism was a minor clearance \npathway in humans.\n\nElimination\nThe mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for dapagliflozin was 12.9 hours following a single oral dose \nof dapagliflozin 10 mg to healthy subjects. The mean total systemic clearance of dapagliflozin \nadministered intravenously was 207 mL/min. Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are primarily \neliminated via urinary excretion with less than 2% as unchanged dapagliflozin. After administration of \na 50 mg [14C]-dapagliflozin dose, 96% was recovered, 75% in urine and 21% in faeces. In faeces, \napproximately 15% of the dose was excreted as parent drug.\n\n\n\n52\n\nLinearity\nDapagliflozin exposure increased proportional to the increment in dapagliflozin dose over the range of \n0.1 to 500 mg and its pharmacokinetics did not change with time upon repeated daily dosing for up to \n24 weeks.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nAt steady-state (20 mg once-daily dapagliflozin for 7 days), subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \nmild, moderate or severe renal impairment (as determined by iohexol plasma clearance) had mean \nsystemic exposures of dapagliflozin of 32%, 60% and 87% higher, respectively, than those of subjects \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. The steady-state 24-hour urinary glucose \nexcretion was highly dependent on renal function and 85, 52, 18 and 11 g of glucose/day was excreted \nby subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function or mild, moderate or severe renal \nimpairment, respectively. The impact of haemodialysis on dapagliflozin exposure is not known.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), mean Cmax and \nAUC of dapagliflozin were up to 12% and 36% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched \ncontrol subjects. These differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful. In subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) mean Cmax and AUC of dapagliflozin were 40% and \n67% higher than matched healthy controls, respectively.\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years)\nThere is no clinically meaningful increase in exposure based on age alone in subjects up to \n70 years old. However, an increased exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function can be \nexpected. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding exposure in patients \n> 70 years old.\n\nPaediatric population\nPharmacokinetics in the paediatric population have not been studied.\n\nGender\nThe mean dapagliflozin AUCss in females was estimated to be about 22% higher than in males.\n\nRace\nThere were no clinically relevant differences in systemic exposures between White, Black or Asian \nraces.\n\nBody weight\nDapagliflozin exposure was found to decrease with increased weight. Consequently, low-weight \npatients may have somewhat increased exposure and patients with high weight somewhat decreased \nexposure. However, the differences in exposure were not considered clinically meaningful.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and fertility. Dapagliflozin \ndid not induce tumours in either mice or rats at any of the doses evaluated in two-year carcinogenicity \nstudies.\n\nReproductive and developmental toxicity\nDirect administration of dapagliflozin to weanling juvenile rats and indirect exposure during late \npregnancy (time periods corresponding to the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with respect to \nhuman renal maturation) and lactation are each associated with increased incidence and/or severity of \nrenal pelvic and tubular dilatations in progeny.\n\n\n\n53\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study, when dapagliflozin was dosed directly to young rats from postnatal day 21 \nuntil postnatal day 90, renal pelvic and tubular dilatations were reported at all dose levels; pup \nexposures at the lowest dose tested were \u2265 15 times the maximum recommended human dose. These \nfindings were associated with dose-related increases in kidney weight and macroscopic kidney \nenlargement observed at all doses. The renal pelvic and tubular dilatations observed in juvenile \nanimals did not fully reverse within the approximate 1-month recovery period.\n\nIn a separate study of pre- and postnatal development, maternal rats were dosed from gestation day 6 \nthrough postnatal day 21, and pups were indirectly exposed in utero and throughout lactation. (A \nsatellite study was conducted to assess dapagliflozin exposures in milk and pups.) Increased incidence \nor severity of renal pelvic dilatation was observed in adult offspring of treated dams, although only at\nthe highest dose tested (associated maternal and pup dapagliflozin exposures were 1,415 times and \n137 times, respectively, the human values at the maximum recommended human dose). Additional \ndevelopmental toxicity was limited to dose-related reductions in pup body weights, and observed only \nat doses \u2265 15 mg/kg/day (associated with pup exposures that are \u2265 29 times the human values at the \nmaximum recommended human dose). Maternal toxicity was evident only at the highest dose tested, \nand limited to transient reductions in body weight and food consumption at dose. The no observed \nadverse effect level (NOAEL) for developmental toxicity, the lowest dose tested, is associated with a \nmaternal systemic exposure multiple that is approximately 19 times the human value at the maximum \nrecommended human dose.\n\nIn additional studies of embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits, dapagliflozin was administered \nfor intervals coinciding with the major periods of organogenesis in each species. Neither maternal nor \ndevelopmental toxicities were observed in rabbits at any dose tested; the highest dose tested is \nassociated with a systemic exposure multiple of approximately 1,191 times the maximum \nrecommended human dose. In rats, dapagliflozin was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic at \nexposures up to 1,441 times the maximum recommended human dose.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Forxiga is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Forxiga\n3. How to take Forxiga\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Forxiga\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Forxiga is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Forxiga is\nForxiga contains the active substance dapagliflozin. It belongs to a group of medicines called \u201coral \nanti-diabetics\u201d.\n\uf0b7 These are medicines taken by mouth for diabetes.\n\uf0b7 They work by lowering the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood.\n\nForxiga is used in adult patients (aged 18 years and older).\n\nWhat Forxiga is used for\nForxiga is used for the types of diabetes called:\n\uf0b7 type 1 diabetes \u2013 where your body hardly produces any insulin. Forxiga should only be used in \n\ntype 1 diabetes patients who are overweight or obese.\n\uf0b7 type 2 diabetes \u2013 where your body does not make enough insulin or is not able to use the insulin \n\nit produces properly.\n\nIn both types of diabetes, this leads to a high level of sugar in your blood. Forxiga works by removing \nexcess sugar from your body via your urine. If you have type 2 diabetes, it can also help prevent heart \ndisease.\n\nForxiga and other diabetes medicines\nType 1 diabetes:\n\uf0b7 Forxiga is used if your type 1 diabetes cannot be controlled with insulin alone.\n\uf0b7 Forxiga is used together with insulin.\n\nType 2 diabetes:\n\uf0b7 Forxiga is used if your type 2 diabetes cannot be controlled with diet and exercise.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may ask you to take Forxiga:\n\n- on its own \u2013 if you cannot tolerate metformin.\n- together with other medicines to treat diabetes.\n\n\n\n71\n\nIt is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Forxiga\n\nDo not take Forxiga:\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to dapagliflozin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nContact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away:\n\uf0b7 If you experience feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or \nmetallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat or rapid weight loss.\n\n\uf0b7 The above symptoms could be a sign of \u201cdiabetic ketoacidosis\u201d \u2013 a serious, sometimes life-\nthreatening problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of \u201cketone bodies\u201d in \nyour urine or blood, seen in tests.\n\n\uf0b7 The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive \nalcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin \ndue to major surgery or serious illness.\n\n\uf0b7 When you are treated with Forxiga, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur even if your blood sugar is \nnormal.\n\n\uf0b7 The risk of getting diabetic ketoacidosis is different in the two types diabetes:\n- in type 2 diabetes it is rare.\n- in type 1 diabetes the risk is higher - this is because your body hardly produces any \n\ninsulin, and diabetic ketoacidosis may occur at sudden decreases in insulin dose (such as \nmissed insulin injections, or issues with your insulin pen or pump).\n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes:\n\uf0b7 Talk with your doctor about the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis before you start to take Forxiga.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will tell you when you may need to measure ketones in your blood or urine and \n\nwhat you need to do when your ketone levels are raised:\n- At blood ketone readings from 0.6 to 1.5 mmol/L (or urine ketones reading +) you may \n\nneed to take extra insulin, drink water, and if your blood glucose is normal or low, you \nmay need to eat carbohydrates. Measure your ketone levels again in 2 hours. Seek \nmedical advice immediately and stop taking Forxiga if levels persist and symptoms \npresent.\n\n- At blood ketone readings over 1.5 to 3.0 mmol/L (or urine ketones reading ++) you may \nbe developing diabetic ketoacidosis, seek medical advice immediately and stop taking \nForxiga. You may need to take extra insulin, drink water, and if your blood glucose is \nnormal or low, you may need to eat carbohydrates. Measure your ketone levels again in \n2 hours.\n\n- At blood ketone readings over 3.0 mmol/L (or urine ketones reading +++) you probably \nhave diabetic ketoacidosis, go to the emergency department without delay and stop taking \nForxiga. You may need to take extra insulin, drink water, and if your blood glucose is \nnormal or low, you may need to eat carbohydrates.\n\nIf you suspect you have diabetic ketoacidosis, contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away \nand do not take this medicine.\n\nTalk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, \nredness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling \ngenerally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening \ninfection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier\u2019s gangrene which destroys the tissue \nunder the skin. Fournier\u2019s gangrene has to be treated immediately.\n\n\n\n72\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Forxiga:\n\uf0b7 if you have a kidney problem \u2013 your doctor may ask you to take a different medicine.\n\uf0b7 if you have a liver problem.\n\uf0b7 if you are on medicines to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) and have a history of \n\nlow blood pressure (hypotension). More information is given below under \u2018Other medicines and \nForxiga\u2019.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have very high levels of sugar in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too \nmuch body fluid). Possible signs of dehydration are listed at the top of section 4. Tell your \ndoctor before you start taking Forxiga if you have any of these signs.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have or develop nausea (feeling sick), vomiting or fever or if you are not able to eat or \ndrink. These conditions can cause dehydration. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Forxiga \nuntil you recover to prevent dehydration.\n\n\uf0b7 if you often get infections of the urinary tract.\n\nLike for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice \nregarding foot care given by your health care professional.\n\nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking Forxiga.\n\nKidney function\nYour kidneys should be checked before you start taking and whilst you are on this medicine.\n\nUrine glucose\nBecause of how Forxiga works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on this medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nForxiga is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because it has not \nbeen studied in these patients.\n\nOther medicines and Forxiga\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\nEspecially tell your doctor:\n\uf0b7 if you are taking a medicine used to remove water from the body (diuretic).

years and older). what forxiga is used for forxiga is used for the types of diabetes called: type 1 diabetes where your body hardly produces any insulin. forxiga should only be used in type 1 diabetes patients who are overweight or obese. type 2 diabetes where your body does not make enough insulin or is not able to use the insulin it produces properly. in both types of diabetes, this leads to a high level of sugar in your blood. forxiga works by removing excess sugar from your body via your urine. if you have type 2 diabetes, it can also help prevent heart disease. forxiga and other diabetes medicines type 1 diabetes: forxiga is used if your type 1 diabetes cannot be controlled with insulin alone. forxiga is used together with insulin. type 2 diabetes: forxiga is used if your type 2 diabetes cannot be controlled with diet and exercise. your doctor may ask you to take forxiga: - on its own if you cannot tolerate metformin. - together with other medicines to treat diabetes. it is

or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away: if you experience feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat or rapid weight loss. the above symptoms could be a sign of \"diabetic ketoacidosis\" a serious, sometimes life- threatening problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of \"ketone bodies\" in your urine or blood, seen in tests. the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness. when you are treated with forxiga, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur even if your blood sugar is normal. the risk of getting diabetic ketoacidosis is different in the two types diabetes: - in type 2 diabetes it is rare. - in type 1 diabetes the risk is higher - this is because your body hardly produces any insulin, and diabetic ketoacidosis may occur at sudden decreases in insulin dose (such as missed insulin injections, or issues with your insulin pen or pump). if you have type 1 diabetes: talk with your doctor about the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis before you start to take forxiga. your doctor will tell you when you may need to measure ketones in your blood or urine and what you need to do when your ketone levels are raised: - at blood ketone readings from 0.6 to 1.5 mmol/l (or urine ketones reading +) you may need to take extra insulin, drink water, and if your blood glucose is normal or low, you may need to eat carbohydrates. measure your ketone levels again in 2 hours. seek medical advice immediately and stop taking forxiga if levels persist and symptoms present. - at blood ketone readings over 1.5 to 3.0 mmol/l (or urine ketones reading ++) you may be developing diabetic ketoacidosis, seek medical advice immediately and stop taking forxiga. you may need to take extra insulin, drink water, and if your blood glucose is normal or low, you may need to eat carbohydrates. measure your ketone levels again in 2 hours. - at blood ketone readings over 3.0 mmol/l (or urine ketones reading +++) you probably have diabetic ketoacidosis, go to the emergency department without delay and stop taking forxiga. you may need to take extra insulin, drink water, and if your blood glucose is normal or low, you may need to eat carbohydrates. if you suspect you have diabetic ketoacidosis, contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away and do not take this medicine. talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling generally unwell. these symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or fournier's gangrene which destroys the tissue under the skin. fournier's gangrene has to be treated immediately. talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking forxiga: if you have a kidney problem your doctor may ask you to take a different medicine. if you have a liver problem. if you are on medicines to lower your blood pressure (anti-hypertensives) and have a history of low blood pressure (hypotension). more information is given below under 'other medicines and forxiga'. if you have very high levels of sugar in your blood which may make you dehydrated (lose too much body fluid). possible signs of dehydration are listed at the top of section 4. tell your doctor before you start taking forxiga if you have any of these signs. if you have or develop nausea (feeling sick), vomiting or fever or if you are not able to eat or drink. these conditions can cause dehydration. your doctor may ask you to stop taking forxiga until you recover to prevent dehydration. if you often get infections of the urinary tract. like for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care given by your health care professional. if any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking forxiga. kidney function your kidneys should be checked before you start taking and whilst you are on this medicine. urine glucose because of how forxiga works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are on this medicine. children and adolescents forxiga is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because it has not been studied in these patients. other medicines and forxiga tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. especially tell your doctor: if you are taking a medicine used to remove water from the body (diuretic). your doctor may ask you to stop taking forxiga. possible signs of losing too much fluid from your body are listed at the top of section 4. if you have type 2 diabetes and are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or a \"sulphonylurea\" medicine. your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, to prevent you from getting low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). if you are taking forxiga for type 1 diabetes, it is important that you keep using insulin. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. you should stop taking this medicine if you become pregnant, since it is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. talk to your doctor if you would like to or are breast-feeding before taking this medicine. do not use forxiga if you are breast-feeding. it is not known if this medicine passes into human breast milk. driving and using machines forxiga has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. taking this medicine with other medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause too low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, sweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. do not drive or use any tools or machines, if you feel dizzy taking forxiga. forxiga contains lactose forxiga contains lactose (milk sugar). if you have been told by
