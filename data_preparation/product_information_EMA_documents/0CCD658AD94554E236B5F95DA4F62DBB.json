CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJinarc is indicated to slow the progression of cyst development and renal insufficiency of autosomal \ndominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 1 to 4 \nat initiation of treatment with evidence of rapidly progressing disease (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTolvaptan treatment must be initiated and monitored under the supervision of physicians with expertise \nin managing ADPKD and a full understanding of the risks of tolvaptan therapy including hepatic \ntoxicity and monitoring requirements (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nJinarc is to be administered twice daily in split dose regimens of 45 mg + 15 mg, 60 mg + 30 mg or \n90 mg + 30 mg. The morning dose is to be taken at least 30 minutes before the morning meal. The \nsecond daily dose can be taken with or without food. According to these split dose regimens the total \ndaily doses are 60 mg, 90 mg, or 120 mg. \n \nDose titration \nThe initial dose is 60 mg tolvaptan per day as a split-dose regimen of 45 mg + 15 mg (45 mg taken upon \nwaking and prior the morning meal and 15 mg taken 8 hours later). The initial dose is to be titrated \nupward to a split-dose regimen of 90 mg tolvaptan (60 mg + 30 mg) per day and then to a target split-\ndose regimen of 120 mg tolvaptan (90 mg + 30 mg) per day, if tolerated, with at least weekly intervals \nbetween titrations. Dose titration has to be performed cautiously to ensure that high doses are not poorly \n\n\n\n4 \n\ntolerated through overly rapid up-titration. Patients may down-titrate to lower doses based on \ntolerability. Patients have to be maintained on the highest tolerable tolvaptan dose. \n \nThe aim of dose titration is to block activity of vasopressin at the renal V2 receptor as completely and \nconstantly as possible, while maintaining acceptable fluid balance (see section 4.4). \n \nMeasurements of urine osmolality are recommended to monitor the adequacy of vasopressin inhibition. \nPeriodic monitoring of plasma osmolality or serum sodium (to calculate plasma osmolarity) and/or body \nweight should be considered to monitor the risk of dehydration secondary to the aquaretic effects of \ntolvaptan in case of patient’s insufficient water intake. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Jinarc in CKD stage 5 have not been explored and therefore tolvaptan \ntreatment should be discontinued if renal insufficiency progresses to CKD stage 5 (see section 4.4). \n \nTherapy must be interrupted if the ability to drink or the accessibility to water is limited (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nTolvaptan must not be taken with grapefruit juice (see section 4.5). Patients must be instructed to drink \nsufficient amounts of water or other aqueous fluids (see section 4.4). \n \nDose adjustment for patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors \nIn patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5), tolvaptan doses have to be reduced as \nfollows: \n \nTolvaptan daily split-dose Reduced dose (once daily) \n90 mg + 30 mg 30 mg (further reduction to 15 mg if 30 mg are not well tolerated) \n60 mg + 30 mg 30 mg (further reduction to 15 mg if 30 mg are not well tolerated) \n45 mg + 15 mg 15 mg \n \nDose adjustment for patients taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors \nIn patients taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors, tolvaptan doses have to be reduced as follows: \n \nTolvaptan daily split-dose Reduced split-dose \n90 mg + 30 mg 45 mg + 15 mg \n60 mg + 30 mg 30 mg + 15 mg \n45 mg + 15 mg 15 mg + 15 mg \n \nFurther reductions have to be considered if patients cannot tolerate the reduced tolvaptan doses. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nIncreasing age has no effect on tolvaptan plasma concentrations. Limited data on the safety and \neffectiveness of tolvaptan in ADPKD patients aged over 55 are available (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment \nTolvaptan is contraindicated in anuric patients (see section 4.3). \n \nDose adjustment is not required in patients with renal impairment. \n \nNo clinical trials in subjects with indices of glomerular filtration rate < 10 mL/min or in patients \nundergoing dialysis have been conducted. The risk of hepatic damage in patients with severely reduced \nrenal function (i.e. estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 20) may be increased; these patients \nshould be carefully monitored for hepatic toxicity. Data for patients in CKD early stage 4 are more \nlimited than for patients in stage 1, 2 or 3 (see section 5.1). No data are available for patients with CKD \nlate stage 4 (eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) and stage 5. Tolvaptan treatment should be discontinued if \nrenal insufficiency progresses to CKD stage 5 (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment the benefits and risks of treatment with Jinarc must be \nevaluated carefully. Patients must be managed carefully and liver enzymes must be monitored regularly \n(see section 4.4). \n \nJinarc is contraindicated in patients with elevated liver enzymes and/or signs or symptoms of liver \ninjury prior to initiation of treatment that meet the requirements for permanent discontinuation of \ntolvaptan (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes \nA and B). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of tolvaptan in children and adolescents has not yet been established. No data \nare available. Tolvaptan is not recommended in the paediatric age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nTablets must be swallowed without chewing and with a glass of water. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to \n\nbenzazepine or benzazepine derivatives (see section 4.4) \n• Elevated liver enzymes and/or signs or symptoms of liver injury prior to initiation of treatment \n\nthat meet the requirements for permanent discontinuation of tolvaptan (see section 4.4) \n• Anuria \n• Volume depletion \n• Hypernatraemia \n• Patients who cannot perceive or respond to thirst \n• Pregnancy (see section 4.6) \n• Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIdiosyncratic hepatic toxicity \n \nTolvaptan has been associated with idiosyncratic elevations of blood alanine and aspartate \naminotransferases (ALT and AST) with infrequent cases of concomitant elevations in bilirubin-total \n(BT). \n \nIn post-marketing experience with tolvaptan in ADPKD, acute liver failure requiring liver \ntransplantation has been reported. \n \nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with ADPKD, the period of onset of hepatocellular \ninjury (by ALT elevations > 3 × ULN) was within 3 to 14 months after initiating treatment and these \nincreases were reversible, with ALT returning to < 3 × ULN within 1 to 4 months. While these \nconcomitant elevations were reversible with prompt discontinuation of tolvaptan, they represent a \npotential for significant liver injury. Similar changes with other medicinal products have been associated \nwith the potential to cause irreversible and potentially life-threatening liver injury (see section 4.8). \n \nPrescribing physicians must comply fully with the safety measures required below. \n \nTo mitigate the risk of significant and/or irreversible liver injury, blood testing for hepatic transaminases \nand bilirubin is required prior to initiation of Jinarc, continuing monthly for 18 months and at regular \n\n\n\n6 \n\n3-monthly intervals thereafter. Concurrent monitoring for symptoms that may indicate liver injury (such \nas fatigue, anorexia, nausea, right upper abdominal discomfort, vomiting, fever, rash, pruritus, dark \nurine or jaundice) is recommended. \n \nIf a patient shows abnormal ALT, AST or BT levels prior to initiation of treatment which fulfil the \ncriteria for permanent discontinuation (see below), the use of tolvaptan is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). In case of abnormal baseline levels below the limits for permanent discontinuation \ntreatment can only be initiated if the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risks and liver \nfunction testing must continue at increased time frequency. The advice of a hepatologist is \nrecommended. \n \nDuring the first 18 months of treatment, Jinarc can only be supplied to patients whose physician has \ndetermined that liver function supports continued therapy. \n \nAt the onset of symptoms or signs consistent with hepatic injury or if clinically significant abnormal \nALT or AST increases are detected during treatment, Jinarc administration must be immediately \ninterrupted and repeat tests including ALT, AST, BT and alkaline phosphatase (AP) must be obtained as \nsoon as possible (ideally within 48 hours to 72 hours). Testing must continue at increased time \nfrequency until symptoms/signs/laboratory abnormalities stabilise or resolve, at which point Jinarc may \nbe re-initiated. \n \nCurrent clinical practice suggests that Jinarc therapy is to be interrupted upon confirmation of sustained \nor increasing transaminase levels and permanently discontinued if significant increases and/or clinical \nsymptoms of hepatic injury persist. \n \nRecommended guidelines for permanent discontinuation include: \n• ALT or AST > 8-times ULN \n• ALT or AST > 5-times ULN for more than 2 weeks \n• ALT or AST > 3-times ULN and (BT > 2-times ULN or International Normalised Ratio \n\n[INR] > 1.5) \n• ALT or AST > 3-times ULN with persistent symptoms of hepatic injury noted above. \n \nIf ALT and AST levels remain below 3-times the ULN, Jinarc therapy may be cautiously re-started, \nwith frequent monitoring at the same or lower doses, as transaminase levels appear to stabilise during \ncontinued therapy in some patients. \n \nAccess to water \n \nTolvaptan may cause adverse reactions related to water loss such as thirst, polyuria, nocturia, and \npollakiuria (see section 4.8). Therefore, patients must have access to water (or other aqueous fluids) and \nbe able to drink sufficient amounts of these fluids (see section 4.2). Patients have to be instructed to \ndrink water or other aqueous fluids at the first sign of thirst in order to avoid excessive thirst or \ndehydration. \n \nAdditionally, patients have to drink 1 to 2 glasses of fluid before bedtime regardless of perceived thirst \nand replenish fluids overnight with each episode of nocturia. \n \nDehydration \n \nVolume status must be monitored in patients taking tolvaptan because treatment with tolvaptan may \nresult in severe dehydration which constitutes a risk factor for renal dysfunction. Accurate monitoring of \nbody weight is recommended. A progressive reduction in body weight could be an early sign of \nprogressive dehydration. If dehydration becomes evident, take appropriate action, which may include \nthe need to interrupt or reduce the dose of tolvaptan and increase fluid intake. Special care must be \ntaken in patients having diseases that impair appropriate fluid intake or who are at an increased risk of \nwater loss e.g. in case of vomiting or diarrhoea. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nUrinary outflow obstruction \n \nUrinary output must be secured. Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example \npatients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing \nacute retention. \n \nFluid and electrolyte balance \n \nFluid and electrolyte status must be monitored in all patients. Administration of tolvaptan induces \ncopious aquaresis and may cause dehydration and increases in serum sodium (see section 4.8) and is \ncontraindicated in hypernatraemic patients (see section 4.3). Therefore, serum creatinine, electrolytes \nand symptoms of electrolyte imbalances (e.g. dizziness, fainting, palpitations, confusion, weakness, gait \ninstability, hyper-reflexia, seizures, coma) have to be assessed prior to and after starting tolvaptan to \nmonitor for dehydration. \n \nDuring long-term treatment, electrolytes have to be monitored at least every three months. \n \nSerum sodium abnormalities \n \nPre-treatment sodium abnormalities (hyponatraemia or hypernatraemia) must be corrected prior to \ninitiation with tolvaptan therapy. \n \nAnaphylaxis \n \nIn post-marketing experience, anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock and rash generalised) has been \nreported very rarely following administration of tolvaptan. This type of reaction occurred after the first \nadministration of tolvaptan. Patients have to be carefully monitored during treatment. Patients with \nknown hypersensitivity reactions to benzazepines or benzazepine derivatives (e.g. benazepril, \nconivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine) may be at risk for hypersensitivity reaction to \ntolvaptan (see section 4.3). \n \nIf an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reactions occur, administration of tolvaptan must be \ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Since hypersensitivity is a contraindication \n(see section 4.3) treatment must never be restarted after an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic \nreactions. \n \nDiabetes mellitus \n \nDiabetic patients with an elevated glucose concentration (e.g. in excess of 300 mg/dL) may present with \npseudo-hyponatraemia. This condition must be excluded prior and during treatment with tolvaptan. \n \nTolvaptan may cause hyperglycaemia (see section 4.8). Therefore, diabetic patients treated with \ntolvaptan must be managed cautiously. In particular this applies to patients with inadequately controlled \ntype II diabetes. \n \nUric acid increases \n \nDecreased uric acid clearance by the kidney is a known effect of tolvaptan. In a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled trial of patients with ADPKD, potentially clinically significant increased uric acid \n(greater than 10 mg/dL) was reported at a higher rate in tolvaptan-patients (6.2 %) compared to \nplacebo-treated patients (1.7 %). Adverse reactions of gout were reported more frequently in \ntolvaptan-treated patients (28/961, 2.9 %) than in patients receiving placebo (7/483, 1.4 %). In addition, \nincreased use of allopurinol and other medicinal products used to manage gout were observed in the \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Effects on serum uric acid are attributable to the reversible renal \nhemodynamic changes that occur in response to tolvaptan effects on urine osmolality and may be \nclinically relevant. However, events of increased uric acid and/or gout were not serious and did not \ncause discontinuation of therapy in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Uric acid concentrations \n\n\n\n8 \n\nare to be evaluated prior to initiation of Jinarc therapy, and as indicated during treatment based on \nsymptoms. \n \nEffect of tolvaptan on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n \nA reversible reduction in GFR has been observed in ADPKD trials at the initiation of tolvaptan \ntreatment. \n \nChronic Kidney Disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Jinarc in CKD late stage 4 (eGFR< 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) and stage 5 have not \nbeen explored. Tolvaptan treatment should be discontinued if renal insufficiency progresses to CKD \nstage 5. \n \nLactose \n \nJinarc contains lactose as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal prodcut. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \nConcomitant use of medicinal products that are moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir, \naprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, \nfluconazole, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil) or strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, \nketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) increase tolvaptan exposure. \n \nCo-administration of tolvaptan and ketoconazole resulted in a 440 % increase in area under \ntime-concentration curve (AUC) and 248 % increase in maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) \nfor tolvaptan. \n \nCo-administration of tolvaptan and fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, produced a 200 % and \n80 % increase in tolvaptan AUC and Cmax, respectively. \n \nCo-administration of tolvaptan with grapefruit juice, a moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitor, produced a \ndoubling of peak tolvaptan concentrations (Cmax). \n \nDose reduction of tolvaptan is recommended for patients while taking moderate or strong CYP3A \ninhibitors (see section 4.2). Patients taking moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors must be managed \ncautiously, in particular if the inhibitors are taken more frequently than once a day. \n \nCYP3A inducers \nConcomitant use of medicinal products that are potent CYP3A inducers (e.g. rifampicin) will decrease \ntolvaptan exposure and efficacy. Co-administration of tolvaptan with rifampicin reduces Cmax and AUC \nfor tolvaptan by about 85 %. Therefore, concomitant administration of tolvaptan with potent CYP3A \ninducers (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John’s Wort) is to be \navoided. \n \nCo-administration with medicinal products that increase serum sodium concentration \nThere is no experience from controlled clinical trials with concomitant use of tolvaptan and hypertonic \nsodium chloride solution, oral sodium formulations, and medicinal products that increase serum sodium \nconcentration. Medicinal products with high sodium content such as effervescent analgesic preparations \nand certain sodium containing treatments for dyspepsia may also increase serum sodium concentration. \nConcomitant use of tolvaptan with medicinal products that increase serum sodium concentration may \n\n\n\n9 \n\nresult in a higher risk for developing hypernatraemia (see section 4.4) and is therefore not \nrecommended. \n \nDiuretics \nTolvaptan has not been extensively studied in ADPKD in combination with diuretics. While there does \nnot appear to be a synergistic or additive effect of concomitant use of tolvaptan with loop and thiazide \ndiuretics, each class of agent has the potential to lead to severe dehydration, which constitutes a risk \nfactor for renal dysfunction. If dehydration or renal dysfunction becomes evident, appropriate action \nmust be taken which may include the need to interrupt or reduce doses of tolvaptan and/or diuretics and \nincreased fluid intake. Other potential causes of renal dysfunction or dehydration must be evaluated and \naddressed. \n \nEffect of tolvaptan on the pharmacokinetics of other products \n \nCYP3A substrates \nIn healthy subjects, tolvaptan, a CYP3A substrate, had no effect on the plasma concentrations of some \nother CYP3A substrates (e.g. warfarin or amiodarone). Tolvaptan increased plasma levels of lovastatin \nby 1.3-to 1.5-fold. Even though this increase has no clinical relevance, it indicates tolvaptan can \npotentially increase exposure to CYP3A4 substrates. \n \nTransporter substrates \nIn-vitro studies indicate that tolvaptan is a substrate and competitive inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). \nIn vitro studies indicate that tolvaptan or its oxobutyric metabolite may have the potential to inhibit \nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, BCRP and OCT1 transporters. Steady state digoxin concentrations were \nincreased (1.3-fold in maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax] and 1.2-fold in area under the \nplasma concentration-time curve over the dosing interval [AUCτ]) when co-administered with multiple \nonce daily 60 mg doses of tolvaptan. Patients receiving digoxin or other narrow therapeutic P-gp \nsubstrates (e.g. dabigatran) must therefore be managed cautiously and evaluated for excessive effects \nwhen treated with tolvaptan. Statins commonly used in the tolvaptan phase 3 pivotal trial (e.g. \nrosuvastatin and pitavastatin) are OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrates, however no difference in adverse \nevents profile was observed during the phase 3 pivotal trial for tolvaptan in ADPKD. If OATP1B1 and \nOATP1B3 substrates (e.g. statins such as rosuvastatin and pitavastatin), OAT3 substrates (e.g. \nmethotrexate, ciprofloxacin), BCRP substrates (e.g. sulfasalazine) or OCT1 substrates (e.g. metformin) \nare co-administered with tolvaptan, patients must be managed cautiously and evaluated for excessive \neffects of these medicinal products. \n \nDiuretics or non-diuretic anti-hypertensive medicinal product(s) \nStanding blood pressure was not routinely measured in ADPKD trials. Therefore, a risk of \northostatic/postural hypotension due to a pharmacodynamic interaction with tolvaptan cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nCo-administration with vasopressin analogues \nIn addition to its renal aquaretic effect, tolvaptan is capable of blocking vascular vasopressin V2 \nreceptors involved in the release of coagulation factors (e.g. von Willebrand factor) from endothelial \ncells. Therefore, the effect of vasopressin analogues such as desmopressin may be attenuated in patients \nusing such analogues to prevent or control bleeding when co-administered with tolvaptan. It is not \nrecommended to administer Jinarc with vasopressin analogues. \n \nSmoking and alcohol \nData related to smoking or alcohol history in ADPKD trials are too limited to determine possible \ninteractions of smoking or alcohol with efficacy and safety of ADPKD treatment with tolvaptan. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of tolvaptan in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Jinarc is not recommended in women of \nchildbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nJinarc is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether tolvaptan is excreted in human breast milk. Studies in rats have shown excretion \nof tolvaptan in milk. A risk for the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Jinarc is contraindicated \nduring breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nStudies in animals showed effects on fertility (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nJinarc has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When driving vehicles or using \nmachines it has to be taken into account that occasionally dizziness, asthenia or fatigue may occur. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe pharmacodynamically predictable and most commonly reported adverse reactions are thirst, \npolyuria, nocturia, and pollakiuria occurring in approximately 55 %, 38 %, 29 % and 23 % of patients, \nrespectively. Furthermore, tolvaptan has been associated with idiosyncratic elevations of blood alanine \naminotransferase (ALT; 4.4 %) and aspartate aminotransferases (AST; 3,1 %) with infrequent cases of \nconcomitant elevations in bilirubin-total (BT; 0,2 %). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe incidences of the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with tolvaptan therapy are tabulated \nbelow. The table is based on adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and/or post-marketing use. \n \nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they are \nderived from spontaneous reports. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse reactions is qualified as \n\"not known\". \n \n Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Anaphylactic \nshock, \nGeneralised rash \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\nPolydipsia Dehydration, \nHypernatraemia, \nDecreased appetite, \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nHyperuricaemia, \nHyperglycaemia, \nGout \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Insomnia   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache, \nDizziness \n\n   \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n Palpitations   \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n \n\n Dyspnoea   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea, \nDry mouth \n\nAbdominal pain, \nAbdominal distension, \nConstipation, \nDyspepsia, \nGastroesophageal reflux \ndisease \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n Abnormal hepatic function  Acute hepatic \nfailure1 \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n \n\n Rash, \nPruritus \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n \n\n Muscle spasms   \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\nNocturia, \nPollakiuria, \nPolyuria \n\n   \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n \n\nFatigue, \nThirst \n \n\nAsthenia   \n\nInvestigations  Alanine aminotransferase \nincreased, \nAspartate aminotransferase \nincreased, \nWeight decreased \n\nBilirubin \nincreased \n\n \n\n1 observed in post-marketing with tolvaptan in ADPKD. Liver transplantation was necessary. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nLaboratory results \nElevation (> 3 × upper limit of normal [ULN]) of ALT was observed in 4.4 % (42/958) of patients on \ntolvaptan and 1.0 % (5/484) of patients on placebo, while elevation (> 3 × ULN) of AST was observed \nin 3.1 % (30/958) of patients on tolvaptan and 0.8 % (4/484) patients on placebo in a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled trial in patients with ADPKD. Two (2/957, 0.2 %) of these tolvaptan treated-patients, \nas well as a third patient from an extension open label trial, exhibited increases in hepatic enzymes \n(> 3 × ULN) with concomitant elevations in BT (> 2 × ULN). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n12 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle oral doses up to 480 mg (4 times the maximum recommended daily dose) and multiple doses up \nto 300 mg once daily for 5 days have been well tolerated in trials in healthy subjects. There is no \nspecific antidote for tolvaptan intoxication. The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose can be \nanticipated to be those of excessive pharmacologic effect: a rise in serum sodium concentration, \npolyuria, thirst and dehydration/hypovolemia. \n \nNo mortality was observed in rats or dogs following single oral doses of 2,000 mg/kg (maximum \nfeasible dose). A single oral dose of 2,000 mg/kg was lethal in mice and symptoms of toxicity in \naffected mice included decreased locomotor activity, staggering gait, tremor and hypothermia. \n \nIn patients with suspected tolvaptan overdose, assessment of vital signs, electrolyte concentrations, ECG \nand fluid status is recommended. Appropriate replacement of water and/or electrolytes must continue \nuntil aquaresis abates. Dialysis may not be effective in removing tolvaptan because of its high binding \naffinity for human plasma protein (> 98 %). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Diuretics, vasopressin antagonists, ATC code: C03XA01. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTolvaptan is a vasopressin antagonist that specifically blocks the binding of arginine vasopressin (AVP) \nat the V2 receptors of the distal portions of the nephron. Tolvaptan affinity for the human V2 receptor is \n1.8 times that of native AVP. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe pharmacodynamic effects of tolvaptan have been determined in healthy subjects and subjects with \nADPKD across CKD stages 1 to 4. Effects on free water clearance and urine volume are evident across \nall CKD stages with smaller absolute effects observed at later stages, consistent with the declining \nnumber of fully functioning nephrons. Acute reductions in mean total kidney volume were also \nobserved following 3 weeks of therapy in all CKD stages, ranging from -4.6 % for CKD stage 1 to -\n1.9 % for CKD stage 4. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe primary focus of the clinical program for development of tolvaptan tablets for the treatment of \nADPKD is a single pivotal, multi-national, phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in which the \nlong-term safety and efficacy of oral split dose tolvaptan regimens (titrated between 60 mg/day and \n120 mg/day) were compared with placebo in 1,445 adult subjects with ADPKD. \n \nIn total, 14 clinical trials involving tolvaptan have been completed worldwide in support of the ADPKD \nindication, including 8 trials in the US, 1 in the Netherlands, 3 in Japan, 1 in Korea, and the \nmultinational phase 3 pivotal trial. \n \nThe phase 3 pivotal trial (TEMPO 3:4, 156-04-251) included subjects from 129 centres in the Americas, \nJapan, Europe and other countries. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the long-term \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nefficacy of tolvaptan in ADPKD through rate of total kidney volume (TKV) change (normalised as \npercentage; %) for tolvaptan-treated compared with placebo-treated subjects. In this trial a total of 1,445 \nadult patients (age 18 years to 50 years) with evidence of rapidly-progressing, early ADPKD (meeting \nmodified Ravine criteria, TKV ≥ 750 mL, estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min) were \nrandomised 2:1 to treatment with tolvaptan or placebo. Patients were treated for up to 3 years. \n \nTolvaptan (n = 961) and placebo (n = 484) groups were well matched in terms of gender with an \naverage age of 39 years. The inclusion criteria identified patients who at baseline had evidence of early \ndisease progression. At baseline, patients had average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of \n82 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration; CKD-EPI) with 79 % \nhaving hypertension and a mean TKV of 1,692 mL (height adjusted 972 mL/m). Approximately 35 % of \nsubjects were CKD stage 1, 48 % CKD stage 2, and 17 % CKD stage 3 (eGFRCKD-EPI). While these \ncriteria were useful in enriching the study population with patients who were rapidly progressing, \nsubgroup analyses based on stratification criteria (age, TKV, GFR, Albuminuria, Hypertension) \nindicated the presence of such risk factors at younger ages predicts more rapid disease progression. \n \nThe results of the primary endpoint, the rate of change in TKV for subjects randomised to tolvaptan \n(normalised as percentage, %) to the rate of change for subjects on placebo, were highly statistically \nsignificant. The rate of TKV increase over 3 years was significantly less for tolvaptan-treated subjects \nthan for subjects receiving placebo: 2.80 % per year versus 5.51 % per year, respectively (ratio of \ngeometric mean 0.974; 95 % CI 0.969 to 0.980; p < 0.0001). \n \nPre-specified secondary endpoints were tested sequentially. The key secondary composite endpoint \n(ADPKD progression) was time to multiple clinical progression events of: \n1) worsening kidney function (defined as a persistent [reproduced over at least 2 weeks] 25 % \n\nreduction in reciprocal serum creatinine during treatment [from end of titration to last on-\nmedicinal product visit]) \n\n2) medically significant kidney pain (defined as requiring prescribed leave, last-resort analgesics, \nnarcotic and anti-nociceptive, radiologic or surgical interventions) \n\n3) worsening hypertension \n4) worsening albuminuria \n \nThe relative rate of ADPKD-related events was decreased by 13.5 % in tolvaptan-treated patients, \n(hazard ratio, 0.87; 95 % CI, 0.78 to 0.97; p = 0.0095). \n \nThe result of the key secondary composite endpoint is primarily attributed to effects on worsening \nkidney function and medically significant kidney pain. The renal function events were 61.4 % less likely \nfor tolvaptan compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95 % CI, 0.26 to 0.57; nominal p < 0.0001), \nwhile renal pain events were 35.8 % less likely in tolvaptan-treated patients (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95 % \nCI, 0.47 to 0.89; nominal p = 0.007). In contrast, there was no effect of tolvaptan on either progression \nof hypertension or albuminuria. \n \nTEMPO 4:4 is an open-label extension study that included 871 subjects that completed TEMPO \n3:4 from 106 centres across 13 countries. This trial evaluated the effects of tolvaptan on safety, TKV \nand eGFR in subjects receiving active treatment for 5 years (early-treated), compared with subjects \ntreated with placebo for 3 years, then switched to active treatment for 2 years (delayed-treated). \n \nThe primary end point for TKV did not distinguish a difference in change (−1.7 %) over the 5-year \ntreatment between early- and delayed-treated subjects at the pre-specified threshold of statistical \nsignificance (p = 0.3580). Both groups’ TKV growth trajectory was slowed, relative to placebo in the \nfirst 3 years, suggesting both early- and delayed- tolvaptan treated subjects benefitted to a similar \ndegree. \n \nA secondary endpoint testing the persistence of positive effects on renal function indicated that the \npreservation of eGFR observed by the end of the TEMPO 3:4 pivotal trial (3.01 to 3.34 mL/min/1.73 m2 \nat follow-up visits 1 and 2) could be preserved during open-label treatment. This difference was \nmaintained in the pre-specified mixed effect model repeat measurement (MMRM) analysis \n\n\n\n14 \n\n(3.15 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95 %CI 1.462 to 4.836, p = 0.0003) and with sensitivity analyses where baseline \neGFR data were carried forward (2.64 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95 % CI 0.672 to 4.603, p = 0.0086). These \ndata suggest that tolvaptan can slow the rate of renal function decline, and that these benefits persist \nover the duration of therapy. \n \nLonger term data are not currently available to show whether long-term therapy with tolvaptan \ncontinues to slow the rate of renal function decline and affect clinical outcomes of ADPKD, including \ndelay in the onset of end-stage renal disease. \n \nGenotyping for PKD1 and PKD2 genes was conducted in a majority of patients entering the open-label \nextension study (TEMPO 4:4) but the results are not yet known. \n \nFollowing an additional 2 years of tolvaptan treatment, resulting in a total of 5 years on tolvaptan \ntherapy no new safety signals were identified. \n \nThe phase 3, multi-centre, international, randomised-withdrawal, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial \n156-13-210 compared the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan (45 mg/day to 120 mg/day) to placebo in \npatients able to tolerate tolvaptan during a five-week titration and run-in period on tolvaptan. The trial \nutilised a randomised withdrawal design, to enrich for patients that were able to tolerate tolvaptan for a \n5-week, single-blind pre-randomisation period consisting of a 2-week titration period and 3-week run-in \nperiod. The design was used to minimise the impact of early discontinuation and missing data on trial \nendpoints. \n \nA total of 1,370 patients (age 18 years to 65 years) with CKD with an eGFR between 25 and \n65 mL/min/1.73 m2 if younger than age 56 years; or eGFR between 25 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m2, plus \neGFR decline >2.0 mL/min/1.73 m2/year if between age 56 years to 65 years were randomised to either \ntolvaptan (n = 683) or placebo (n = 687) and were treated for a period of 12 months. \n \nFor subjects randomised, the baseline, average eGFR was 41 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD-EPI) and historical \nTKV, available in 318 (23 %) of subjects, averaged 2,026 mL. Approximately 5 %, 75 % and 20 % had \nan eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater (CKD stage 2), or less than 60 and greater than \n30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stage 3) or less than 30 but greater than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stage 4), \nrespectively. The CKD stage 3 can be subdivided further to stage 3a 30 %, (eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 \nto less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and stage 3b 45 %, (eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2). \n \nThe primary endpoint of the trial was the change in eGFR from pre-treatment baseline levels to post-\ntreatment assessment. In patients treated with tolvaptan the reduction in eGFR was significantly less \nthan in patients treated with placebo (p < 0.0001). The treatment difference in eGFR change observed in \nthis trial is 1.27 mL/min/1.73 m2, representing a 35 % reduction in the LS means of change in eGFR of -\n2.34 mL/min/1.73 m2 in tolvaptan group relative to a -3.61 mL/min/1.73 m2 in placebo group observed \nover the course of one year. The key secondary endpoint was a comparison of the efficacy of tolvaptan \ntreatment versus placebo in reducing the decline of annualised eGFR slope across all measured time \npoints in the trial. These data also showed significant benefit from tolvaptan versus placebo \n(p < 0.0001). \n \nSubgroup analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints by CKD stage found similar, consistent \ntreatment effects relative to placebo for subjects in stages 2, 3a, 3b and early stage 4 (eGFR 25 to \n29 mL/min/1.73 m2) at baseline. \n \nA pre-specified subgroup analysis suggested that tolvaptan had less of an effect in patients older than \n55 years of age, a small subgroup with a notably slower rate of eGFR decline. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ntolvaptan in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in polycystic kidney disease (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, tolvaptan is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring \nabout 2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan is about 56 %. Co-administration of \ntolvaptan with a high-fat meal increased peak concentrations of tolvaptan up to 2-fold but left AUC \nunchanged. Even though the clinical relevance of this finding is not known, the morning dose should be \ntaken under fasted conditions to minimise the unnecessary risk of increasing the maximal exposure (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing single oral doses of ≥ 300 mg, peak plasma concentrations appear to plateau, possibly due to \nsaturation of absorption. Tolvaptan binds reversibly (98 %) to plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTolvaptan is extensively metabolised in the liver almost exclusively by CYP3A. Tolvaptan is a weak \nCYP3A4 substrate and does not appear to have any inhibitory activity. In vitro studies indicated that \ntolvaptan has no inhibitory activity for CYP3A. Fourteen metabolites have been identified in plasma, \nurine and faeces; all but one were also metabolised by CYP3A. Only the oxobutyric acid metabolite is \npresent at greater than 10 % of total plasma radioactivity; all others are present at lower concentrations \nthan tolvaptan. Tolvaptan metabolites have little to no contribution to the pharmacological effect of \ntolvaptan; all metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V2 receptors when compared \nwith tolvaptan. The terminal elimination half-life is about 8 hours and steady-state concentrations of \ntolvaptan are obtained after the first dose. \n \nElimination \n \nLess than 1 % of intact active substance is excreted unchanged in the urine. Radio labelled tolvaptan \nexperiments showed that 40 % of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 59 % was recovered \nin the faeces, where unchanged tolvaptan accounted for 32 % of radioactivity. Tolvaptan is only a minor \ncomponent in plasma (3 %). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nFollowing single oral doses, Cmax values show less than dose proportional increases from 30 mg to \n240 mg and then a plateau at doses from 240 mg to 480 mg. AUC increases linearly. \n \nFollowing multiple once daily dosing of 300 mg, tolvaptan exposure was only increased 6.4-fold when \ncompared to a 30 mg dose. For split-dose regimens of 30 mg/day, 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day in \nADPKD patients, tolvaptan exposure (AUC) increases linearly. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge \nClearance of tolvaptan is not significantly affected by age. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh classes A and B) on the \npharmacokinetics of tolvaptan was investigated in 87 patients with liver disease of various origins. No \nclinically significant changes have been seen in clearance for doses ranging from 5 mg to 60 mg. Very \nlimited information is available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with hepatic oedema, AUC of tolvaptan in severely \n(Child-Pugh class C) and mildly or moderately (Child-Pugh classes A and B) hepatic impaired patients \nwere 3.1-times and 2.3-times higher than that in healthy subjects. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis for patients with ADPKD, tolvaptan concentrations were \nincreased, compared to healthy subjects, as renal function decreased below eGFR of \n60 mL/min/1.73 m2. An eGFRCKD-EPI decrease from 72.2 to 9.79 (mL/min/1.73 m2) was associated with \na 32 % reduction in total body clearance. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential. Teratogenicity was noted \nin rabbits given 1,000 mg/kg/day (7.5 times the exposure from the 120 mg/day human dose on an AUC \nbasis). No teratogenic effects were seen in rabbits at 300 mg/kg/day (about 1.25 to 2.65 times the \nexposure in humans at the 120 mg/day dose, based on AUC). In a peri- and post-natal study in rats, \ndelayed ossification and reduced pup bodyweight were seen at the high dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. \n \nTwo fertility studies in rats showed effects on the parental generation (decreased food consumption and \nbody weight gain, salivation), but tolvaptan did not affect reproductive performance in males and there \nwere no effects on the foetuses. In females, abnormal oestrus cycles were seen in both studies. \nThe no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for effects on reproduction in females (100 mg/kg/day) \nwas about 8-times the maximum human recommended dose of 120 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. \n \n \n6.

See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you take Jinarc \n3. How to take Jinarc \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Jinarc \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Jinarc is and what it is used for \n \nJinarc contains the active substance tolvaptan which blocks the effect of vasopressin, a hormone \ninvolved in the formation of cysts in the kidneys of ADPKD patients. By blocking the effect of \nvasopressin, Jinarc slows the development of kidney cysts in patients with ADPKD, reduces symptoms \nof the disease and increases urine production. \n \nJinarc is a medicine used to treat a disease called “autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease” \n(ADPKD). This disease causes growth of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, which put pressure on \nsurrounding tissues and reduce kidney function, possibly leading to kidney failure. Jinarc is used to treat \nADPKD in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1 to 4 with evidence of rapidly progressing \ndisease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Jinarc \n \nDo not take Jinarc \n• if you are allergic to tolvaptan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\nor if you are allergic to benzazepine or benzazepine derivatives (e.g. benazepril, conivaptan, \nfenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine) \n\n• if you have been told that you have raised levels of liver enzymes in your blood which do not \nallow treatment with tolvaptan \n\n• if your kidneys do not work (no urine production) \n• if you have a condition which is associated with a very low blood volume (e.g. severe \n\ndehydration or bleeding) \n\n\n\n62 \n\n• if you have a condition which increases the sodium in your blood \n• if you do not realise when you are thirsty \n• if you are pregnant \n• if you are breastfeeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Jinarc \n• if you suffer from liver disease. \n• if you cannot drink enough water (see “drinking enough water” below) or if you have to restrict \n\nyour fluid intake. \n• if you have difficulties urinating (e.g. have an enlarged prostate). \n• if you suffer from too high or too low blood sodium. \n• if you had an allergic reaction in the past to benzazepine, tolvaptan or other benzazepine \n\nderivatives (e.g. benazepril, conivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine), or to any of the \nother ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n• if you have diabetes. \n• if you have been told you have high levels of a chemical called uric acid in your blood (which \n\nmay have caused attacks of gout). \n• if you have advanced kidney disease. \n \nThis medicine may cause your liver to not work properly. Therefore, please inform your doctor \nimmediately if you have signs that could indicate potential liver problems such as: \n• nausea \n• vomiting \n• fever \n• tiredness \n• loss of appetite \n• pain in the abdomen \n• dark urine \n• jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes) \n• itching of your skin \n• flu-like syndrome (joint and muscle pain with fever) \n \nDuring treatment with this medicine, your doctor will arrange monthly blood tests to check for \nchanges in your liver function. \n \nDrinking enough water \n \nThis medicine causes water loss because it increases your urine production. This water loss may result \nin side effects such as dry mouth and thirst or even more severe side effects like kidney problems (see \nsection 4). It is therefore important that you have access to water and that you are able to drink sufficient \namounts when you feel thirsty. Before bed-time you must drink 1 or 2 glasses of water even if you do \nnot feel thirsty and you must also drink water after you urinate at night. Special care must be taken if \nyou have a disease that reduces appropriate fluid intake or if you are at an increased risk of water loss \ne.g. in case of vomiting or diarrhoea. Due to the increased urine production, it is also important that you \nalways have access to a toilet. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents (under age of 18 years) because it has not been \nstudied in these age groups. \n \nOther medicines and Jinarc \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nThe following medicines may increase the effect of Jinarc: \n• amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir (used to treat HIV/AIDS), \n\n\n\n63 \n\n• aprepitant (used to avoid nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy), \n• crizotinib and imatinib (used to treat cancer), \n• ketoconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole (used to treat fungal infections), \n• macrolide antibiotics like erythromycin or clarithromycin, \n• verapamil (used to treat heart diseases and high blood pressure), \n• diltiazem (used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain). \n \nThe following medicines may lower the effect of Jinarc: \n• phenytoin or carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy), \n• rifampicin, rifabutin or rifapentin (used to treat tuberculosis), \n• St. John’s Wort (a traditional herbal medicinal product for the relief of slightly low mood and \n\nmild anxiety). \n \nJinarc may increase the effect of the following medicines: \n• digoxin (used to treat irregular heart beat and heart failure), \n• dabigatran (used to thin the blood), \n• rosuvastatin or pitavastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol), \n• methotrexate (used to treat cancer, arthritis), \n• ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic), \n• sulfasalazine (used to treat inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis), \n• metformin (used to treat diabetes). \n \nJinarc may lower the effect of the following medicines: \n• vasopressin analogues such as desmopressin (used to increase blood clotting factors or to control \n\nurine output or bedwetting). \n \nThese medicines can affect or be affected by Jinarc: \n• diuretics (used to influence the production of urine). Taken with Jinarc these may increase the \n\nrisk of side effects due to water loss or may cause kidney problems. \n• diuretics or other medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure. Taken with Jinarc these may \n\nincrease the risk of low blood pressure when you stand up from sitting or lying down. \n• medicines which increase the level of sodium in your blood or which contain large amounts of \n\nsalt (e.g. tablets that dissolve in water and indigestion remedies). These may increase the effect of \nJinarc. There is a risk that this may lead to too much sodium in your blood. \n\n \nIt may still be alright for you to take these medicines and Jinarc together. Your doctor will be able to \ndecide what is suitable for you. \n \nJinarc with food and drink \nDo not drink grapefruit juice when taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \nWomen of childbearing age must use reliable contraceptive measures during use of this medicine. \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people may feel dizzy, weak or tired after being given Jinarc. If this happens to you, do not drive \nor use any tools or machines. \n \nJinarc contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n3. How to take Jinarc \n \nJinarc can only be prescribed by doctors who are specialised in the treatment of ADPKD. Always take \nthis medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not \nsure. \n \nDose \n \nThe daily amount of Jinarc is split into two doses, one bigger than the other. The higher dose should be \ntaken in the morning when you wake up, at least 30 minutes before the morning meal. The lower dose is \ntaken 8 hours later. \n \nThe dose combinations are: \n45 mg + 15 mg \n60 mg + 30 mg \n90 mg + 30 mg \n \nYour treatment will normally start with a dose of 45 mg in the morning and 15 mg 8 hours later. Your \ndoctor may gradually increase your dose up to a maximum combination of 90 mg on waking and 30 mg \nafter 8 hours. To find the best dose your doctor will regularly check how well you are tolerating a \nprescribed dose. You should always take the highest tolerable dose combination prescribed by your \ndoctor. \n \nIf you take other medicines, which can increase the effects of Jinarc you may receive lower doses. In \nthis case your doctor may prescribe you Jinarc tablets with 30 mg or 15 mg tolvaptan which have to be \ntaken once a day in the morning. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSwallow the tablets without chewing, with a glass of water. \nThe morning dose is to be taken at least 30 minutes before the morning meal. The second daily dose can \nbe taken with or without food. \n \nIf you take more Jinarc than you should \nIf you have taken more tablets than your prescribed dose, drink plenty of water and contact your \ndoctor or your local hospital immediately. Remember to take the medicine pack with you so that it is \nclear what you have taken. If you take the higher dose very late in the day you may have to go to the \ntoilet at night more frequently. \n \nIf you forget to take Jinarc \nIf you forget to take your medicine, you should take the dose as soon as you remember on the same day. \nIf you do not take your tablets on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. DO NOT take a \ndouble dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you stop taking Jinarc \nIf you stop taking this medicine your kidney cysts may grow as fast as they did before you started \ntreatment with Jinarc.
