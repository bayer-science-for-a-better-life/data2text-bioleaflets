CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nNateglinide is indicated for combination therapy with metformin in type 2 diabetic patients \n\ninadequately controlled despite a maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nNateglinide should be taken within 1 to 30 minutes before meals (usually breakfast, lunch and dinner). \n\n \n\nThe dosage of nateglinide should be determined by the physician according to the patient’s \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 60 mg three times daily before meals, particularly in patients who \n\nare near goal HbA1c. This may be increased to 120 mg three times daily. \n\n \n\nDose adjustments should be based on periodic glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements. \n\nSince the primary therapeutic effect of Starlix is to reduce mealtime glucose (a contributor to HbA1c), \n\nthe therapeutic response to Starlix may also be monitored with 1–2 hour post-meal glucose. \n\n \n\nThe recommended maximum daily dose is 180 mg three times daily to be taken before the three main \n\nmeals. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThe clinical experience in patients over 75 years of age is limited. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Although there is \n\na 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis patients, the systemic availability and half-life in \n\ndiabetic subjects with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 15–50 ml/min) was \n\ncomparable between renal subjects requiring haemodialysis and healthy subjects. Although safety was \n\nnot compromised in this population dose adjustment may be required in view of low Cmax. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. As patients \n\nwith severe liver disease were not studied, nateglinide is contraindicated in this group. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere are no data available on the use of nateglinide in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its \n\nuse in this age group is not recommended. \n\n \n\nOthers \n\nIn debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and \n\ncareful titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nStarlix is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\n Type 1 diabetes (C-peptide negative) \n\n Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma \n\n Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n\n Severe hepatic impairment \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nNateglinide should not be used in monotherapy. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\n \n\nLike other insulin secretagogues, nateglinide is capable of producing hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia has been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet and exercise, and in those \n\ntreated with oral antidiabetic agents (see section 4.8). Elderly, malnourished patients and those with \n\nadrenal or pituitary insufficiency or severe renal impairment are more susceptible to the glucose-\n\nlowering effect of these treatments. The risk of hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients may be \n\nincreased by strenuous physical exercise, or ingestion of alcohol. \n\n \n\nPatients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2) who have not undergone haemodialysis are \n\nmore susceptible to the glucose-lowering effect of Starlix. Discontinuation should be considered in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment who present with potentiation of the hypoglycaemic effect. \n\n \n\nSymptoms of hypoglycaemia (unconfirmed by blood glucose levels) were observed in patients whose \n\nbaseline HbA1c was close to the therapeutic target (HbA1c <7.5%). \n\n \n\nCombination with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared to \n\nmonotherapy. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia may be difficult to recognise in subjects receiving beta blockers. \n\n \n\nWhen a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic agent is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, \n\ninfection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary to \n\ndiscontinue oral hypoglycaemic treatment and replace it with insulin on a temporary basis. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nStarlix contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \n\nof the Lapp lactase deficiency or of glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNateglinide should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nSevere hepatic impairment, children and adolescents \n\nNo clinical studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment, or in children and \n\nadolescents. Treatment is therefore not recommended in these patient groups. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nA number of medicinal products influence glucose metabolism and possible interactions should \n\ntherefore be taken into account by the physician. \n\n \n\nCombination with ACE-inhibitors, NSAIDs, salicylates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, non-selective \n\nbeta-adrenergic-blocking agents and anabolic hormones \n\n \n\nThe following agents may enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: angiotensin-converting \n\nenzyme inhibitors (ACEI), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, salicylates, monoamine oxidase \n\n\n\n5 \n\ninhibitors, non-selective beta-adrenergic-blocking agents and anabolic hormones (e.g. \n\nmethandrostenolone). \n\n \n\nDiuretics, corticosteroids, beta2 agonists, somatropin, somatostatin analogues, rifampin, phenytoin and \n\nSt. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\n \n\nThe following agents may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: diuretics, corticosteroids, \n\nbeta2 agonists, somatropin, somatostatin analogues (e.g. lanreotide, octreotide), rifampin, phenytoin \n\nand St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n\n \n\nWhen these medicinal products - that enhance or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide - are \n\nadministered to or withdrawn from patients receiving nateglinide, the patient should be observed \n\nclosely for changes in glycaemic control. \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 and CYP3A4 substrates \n\n \n\nData available from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly \n\nmetabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent. \n\n \n\nIn an interaction trial with sulfinpyrazone, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, a modest increase in nateglinide AUC \n\n(~28%) was observed in healthy volunteers, with no changes in the mean Cmax and elimination \n\nhalf-life. A more prolonged effect and possibly a risk of hypoglycaemia cannot be excluded in patients \n\nwhen nateglinide is co-administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors. \n\n \n\nParticular caution is recommended when nateglinide is co-administered with other more potent \n\ninhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g. fluconazole, gemfibrozil or sulfinpyrazone), or in patients known to be \n\npoor metabolisers for CYP2C9 substrates. \n\n \n\nInteraction studies with a CYP3A4 inhibitor have not been carried out in vivo. \n\n \n\nIn vivo, nateglinide has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products \n\nmetabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The pharmacokinetics of warfarin (a substrate for CYP3A4 \n\nand CYP2C9), diclofenac (a substrate for CYP2C9), and digoxin were unaffected by coadministration \n\nwith nateglinide. Conversely, these medicinal products had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \n\nnateglinide. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for digoxin, warfarin or other drugs that are \n\nCYP2C9 or CYP3A4 substrates upon coadministration with Starlix. Similarly, there was no clinically \n\nsignificant pharmacokinetic interaction of Starlix with other oral antidiabetic agents such as metformin \n\nor glibenclamide. \n\n \n\nNateglinide has shown a low potential for protein displacement in in vitro studies. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). There is no experience in \n\npregnant women, therefore the safety of Starlix in pregnant women cannot be assessed. Starlix, like \n\nother oral antidiabetic agents, must not be used in pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nNateglinide is excreted in the milk following a peroral dose to lactating rats. Although it is not known \n\nwhether nateglinide is excreted in human milk, the potential for hypoglycaemia in breast-fed infants \n\nmay exist and therefore nateglinide should not be used in lactating women. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNateglinide did not impair fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nThe effect of Starlix on the ability to drive or operate machinery has not been studied. \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \n\nconsidered in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nBased on the experience with nateglinide and with other hypoglycaemic agents, the following adverse \n\nreactions have been seen. Frequencies are defined as: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to \n\n<1/10); uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\n \n\nAs with other antidiabetic agents, symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia have been observed after \n\nadministration of nateglinide. These symptoms included sweating, trembling, dizziness, increased \n\nappetite, palpitations, nausea, fatigue, and weakness. These were generally mild in nature and easily \n\nhandled by intake of carbohydrates when necessary. In completed clinical trials, symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia were reported in 10.4% with nateglinide monotherapy, 14.5% with \n\nnateglinide+metformin combination, 6.9% with metformin alone, 19.8% with glibenclamide alone, \n\nand 4.1% with placebo. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nRare: Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, itching and urticaria. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\n \n\nCommon: Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\nCommon: Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea. \n\nUncommon: Vomiting. \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n \n\nRare: Elevations in liver enzymes. \n\n \n\nOther events \n\n \n\nOther adverse events observed in clinical studies were of a similar incidence in Starlix-treated and \n\nplacebo-treated patients. \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience \n\n \n\nPost-marketing data revealed very rare cases of erythema multiforme. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn a clinical study in patients, Starlix was administered in increasing doses up to 720 mg a day for \n\n7 days and was well tolerated. There is no experience of an overdose of Starlix in clinical trials. \n\nHowever, an overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose-lowering effect, with the development of \n\nhypoglycaemic symptoms. Hypoglycaemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurological \n\nfindings should be treated with oral glucose and adjustments in dosage and/or meal patterns. Severe \n\nhypoglycaemic reactions with coma, seizure or other neurological symptoms should be treated with \n\nintravenous glucose. As nateglinide is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not an efficient means of \n\nremoving it from the blood. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: D-phenylalanine derivative, ATC code: A10 BX 03 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nNateglinide is an amino acid (phenylalanine) derivative, which is chemically and pharmacologically \n\ndistinct from other antidiabetic agents. Nateglinide is a rapid, short-acting oral insulin secretagogue. \n\nIts effect is dependent on functioning beta cells in the pancreas islets. \n\n \n\nEarly insulin secretion is a mechanism for the maintenance of normal glycaemic control. Nateglinide, \n\nwhen taken before a meal, restores early or first phase insulin secretion, which is lost in patients with \n\ntype 2 diabetes, resulting in a reduction in post-meal glucose and HbA1c. \n\n \n\nNateglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the beta-cell membrane with characteristics \n\nthat distinguish it from other sulphonylurea receptor ligands. This depolarises the beta cell and leads to \n\nan opening of the calcium channels. The resulting calcium influx enhances insulin secretion. \n\nElectrophysiological studies demonstrate that nateglinide has 45–300-fold selectivity for pancreatic \n\nbeta cell versus cardiovascular K\n+\n\nATP channels. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nIn type 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic response to a meal occurs within the first 15 minutes \n\nfollowing an oral dose of nateglinide. This results in a blood-glucose-lowering effect throughout the \n\nmeal period. Insulin levels return to baseline within 3 to 4 hours, reducing post-meal \n\nhyperinsulinaemia. \n\n \n\nNateglinide-induced insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is glucose-sensitive, such that less \n\ninsulin is secreted as glucose levels fall. Conversely, the coadministration of food or a glucose \n\ninfusion results in an enhancement of insulin secretion. \n\n \n\nIn combination with metformin, which mainly affected fasting plasma glucose, the effect of \n\nnateglinide on HbA1c was additive compared to either agent alone. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nNateglinide efficacy was inferior to that of metformin in monotherapy (decrease in HbA1c (%) with \n\nmetformin 500 mg three times daily monotherapy: –1.23 [95% CI: –1.48; –0.99] and with nateglinide \n\n120 mg three times daily monotherapy –0.90 [95% CI: –1.14; –0.66]). \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of nateglinide in combination with metformin has been compared to the combination of \n\ngliclazide plus metformin in a 6-month randomised, double-blind trial in 262 patients using a \n\nsuperiority design. The decrease from baseline in HbA1c was –0.41% in the nateglinide plus metformin \n\ngroup and –0.57% in the gliclazide plus metformin group (difference 0.17%, [95% CI –0.03, 0.36]). \n\nBoth treatments were well tolerated. \n\n \n\nAn outcome study has not been conducted with nateglinide, therefore the long-term benefits associated \n\nwith improved glycaemic control have not been demonstrated. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nNateglinide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of Starlix tablets prior to a meal, with \n\nmean peak drug concentration generally occurring in less than 1 hour. Nateglinide is rapidly and \n\nalmost completely ( 90%) absorbed from an oral solution. Absolute oral bioavailability is estimated \n\nto be 72%. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe steady-state volume of distribution of nateglinide based on intravenous data is estimated to be \n\napproximately 10 litres. In vitro studies show that nateglinide is extensively bound (97–99%) to serum \n\nproteins, mainly serum albumin and to a lesser extent alpha1-acid glycoprotein. The extent of serum \n\nprotein binding is independent of drug concentration over the test range of 0.1–10 g Starlix/ml. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nNateglinide is extensively metabolised. The main metabolites found in humans result from \n\nhydroxylation of the isopropyl side-chain, either on the methine carbon, or one of the methyl groups; \n\nactivity of the main metabolites is about 5–6 and 3 times less potent than nateglinide, respectively. \n\nMinor metabolites identified were a diol, an isopropene and acyl glucuronide(s) of nateglinide; only \n\nthe isopropene minor metabolite possesses activity, which is almost as potent as nateglinide. Data \n\navailable from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly \n\nmetabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nNateglinide and its metabolites are rapidly and completely eliminated. Most of the [14C] nateglinide is \n\nexcreted in the urine (83%), with an additional 10% eliminated in the faeces. Approximately 75% of \n\nthe administered [\n14\n\nC] nateglinide is recovered in the urine within six hours post-dose. Approximately \n\n6–16% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Plasma concentrations \n\ndecline rapidly and the elimination half-life of nateglinide typically averaged 1.5 hours in all studies of \n\nStarlix in volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients. Consistent with its short elimination half-life, there is \n\nno apparent accumulation of nateglinide upon multiple dosing with up to 240 mg three times daily. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes who were given Starlix with a dose range of 60 mg to 240 mg before \n\nmeals three times a day for one week, nateglinide showed linear pharmacokinetics for both AUC and \n\nCmax. Tmax was independent of dose. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nAge did not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of nateglinide. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in non-diabetic subjects with mild to moderate \n\nhepatic impairment did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in diabetic patients with mild, moderate \n\n(creatinine clearance 31–50 ml/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15–30 ml/min) renal impairment \n\n(not undergoing dialysis) did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in healthy subjects. \n\nThere is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients. The systemic \n\navailability and half-life in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients was comparable with healthy subjects. \n\nAlthough safety was not compromised in this population dose adjustment may be required in view of \n\nlow Cmax. \n\n \n\nRepeated dosing with 90 mg once daily for 1 to 3 months in diabetic patients with end-stage renal \n\ndisease (ESRD) showed pronounced M1 metabolite accumulation up to 1.2 ng/ml despite the reduced \n\ndose. M1 concentration decreased markedly after haemodialysis. Although M1 metabolites show only \n\nslight hypoglycaemic activity (approximately 5 times lower than nateglinide), metabolite \n\naccumulation might increase the hypoglycaemic effect of the administered dose. Therefore, dose \n\ndiscontinuation is advisable in patients with severe renal impairment who present with potentiation of \n\nhypoglycaemic effect while on Starlix. \n \n\nGender \n\nNo clinically significant differences in nateglinide pharmacokinetics were observed between men and \n\nwomen. \n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n\n \n\nFood effect \n\nWhen given post-prandially, the extent of nateglinide absorption (AUC) remains unaffected. However, \n\nthere is a delay in the rate of absorption characterised by a decrease in Cmax and a delay in time to peak \n\nplasma concentration (tmax). It is recommended that Starlix be administered prior to meals. It is usually \n\ntaken immediately (1 minute) before a meal but may be taken up to 30 minutes before meals. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to fertility and \n\npost-natal development. Nateglinide was not teratogenic in rats. In rabbits, embryonic development \n\nwas adversely affected and the incidence of gallbladder agenesis or small gallbladder was increased at \n\ndoses of 300 and 500 mg/kg (approximately 24 and 28 times the human therapeutic exposure with a \n\nmaximum recommended nateglinide dose of 180 mg, three times daily before meals), but not at \n\n150 mg/kg (approximately 17 times the human therapeutic exposure with a maximum recommended \n\nnateglinide dose of 180 mg, three times daily before meals). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n6.

What Starlix is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Starlix is \n\nThe active substance of Starlix, nateglinide, belongs to a group of medicines called oral antidiabetics. \n\n \n\nStarlix is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. It helps to control the level of sugar in the \n\nblood. Your doctor will prescribe Starlix together with metformin, if inadequately controlled despite a \n\nmaximally tolerated dose of metformin. \n\n \n\nHow Starlix works \nInsulin is a substance produced in the body by the pancreas. It helps to decrease blood sugar levels, \n\nespecially after meals. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may not start producing insulin quickly \n\nenough after meals. Starlix works by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin more quickly, which \n\nhelps to keep blood sugar levels under control after meals. \n\n \n\nStarlix tablets start to act within a very short time after they are swallowed and are eliminated from the \n\nbody rapidly. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Starlix \n\n \n\nFollow all instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse carefully, even if they are \n\ndifferent from what is in this leaflet. \n\n \n\nDo not take Starlix \n\n- if you are allergic to nateglinide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n- if you have type 1 diabetes (i.e. your body does not produce any insulin). \n- if you are experiencing any symptoms of severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar and/or \n\ndiabetic ketoacidosis). These symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, weakness, \n\nfatigue, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n- if you know that you have a severe liver problem. \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, do not take Starlix and talk to your doctor. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Starlix. \n\nDiabetic patients may develop symptoms associated with low blood sugar (also called \n\nhypoglycaemia). Oral antidiabetics, including Starlix, may also produce symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you have low blood sugar you may experience sweating, tremors (feeling shaky), anxiety, difficulty \n\nconcentrating, confusion, weakness or fainting or have other signs listed in section 4, “Possible side \n\neffects”. \n\n \n\nIf this happens to you, eat or drink something containing sugar, and talk to your doctor. \n \n\nSome people are more likely to get symptoms of low blood sugar than others. Take care: \n\n- if you are over 65 years of age. \n- if you are undernourished. \n- if you have another medical condition that may cause low blood sugar (e.g. an under-active \n\npituitary or adrenal gland). \n\nIf any of these apply to you, monitor your blood sugar levels more carefully. \n\n \n\nWatch carefully for signs of low blood sugar, especially: \n\n- if you have exercised more strenuously than usual. \n- if you have drunk alcohol. \n \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Starlix \n\n- if you know that you have a liver problem. \n- if you have a severe kidney problem. \n- if you have problems with drug metabolism. \n- if you are due to have an operation. \n- if you have recently suffered a fever, an accident or an infection. \nYour treatment may need to be adjusted. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nStarlix is not recommended for children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) because its effects in \n\nthis age group have not been studied. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nStarlix can be used by people over 65 years of age. Such patients should take special care to avoid low \n\nblood sugar. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Starlix \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nThe amount of Starlix that you need may change if you take other medicines as these may cause your \n\nblood sugar levels to go up or down. \n\n \n\nIt is especially important that you tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking: \n\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (used, for example, to treat muscle and joint pain). \n- Salicylates such as aspirin (used as painkillers). \n- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (used to treat depression). \n- Beta blockers or ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) (used, for example, \n\nto treat high blood pressure and certain heart conditions). \n\n- Diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure). \n\n\n\n31 \n\n- Corticosteroids such as prednisone and cortisone (used to treat inflammatory disorders). \n- Inhibitors of drug metabolism such as fluconazole (used to treat fungal infection), gemfibrozil \n\n(used to treat dyslipidaemia) or sulfinpyrazone (used to treat chronic gout). \n\n- Sympathomimetics (used, for example, to treat asthma). \n- Anabolic hormones (e.g. methandrostenolone). \n- St. John’s Wort, also known as Hypericum perforatum (a herbal medicine). \n- Somatropin (a growth hormone). \n- Somatostatin analogues such as lanreotide and octreotide (used to treat acromegaly). \n- Rifampin (used, for example, to treat tuberculosis). \n- Phenytoin (used, for example, to treat seizures). \nYour doctor may adjust the dose of these medicines. \n\n \n\nStarlix with food, drink and alcohol \n\nTake Starlix before meals (see section 3, “How to take Starlix”); its effect may be delayed if it is taken \n\nduring or after meals. \n\n \n\nAlcohol may disturb the control of your blood sugar so you are advised to talk to your doctor about \n\ndrinking alcohol while taking Starlix. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nDo not take Starlix if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. See your doctor as soon \n\nas possible if you become pregnant during treatment. \n\n \n\nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Starlix. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if you have low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). \n\nBear this in mind if you drive a car or operate machines as you might put yourself or others at risk. \n\n \n\nYou should ask for doctor advice on driving if you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia or if you \n\nare not aware of the first signs of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nStarlix contains lactose \n\nStarlix tablets contain lactose monohydrate. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \n\nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Starlix \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \n\ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Starlix is 60 mg three times daily, taken before each of the three \n\nmain meals. Your doctor may check the amount of Starlix that you are taking on a regular basis and \nmay adjust the dose according to your needs. The maximum recommended dose is 180 mg three times \n\ndaily, taken before each of the three main meals. \n\n \n\nTake Starlix before meals. Its effect may be delayed if it is taken during or after meals. \n\nTake Starlix before the three main meals, usually: \n\n- 1 dose before breakfast \n- 1 dose before lunch \n- 1 dose before dinner \n \n\nIt is best to take it right before a main meal but you can take it up to 30 minutes before. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nDo not take it if you are not going to eat a main meal. If you miss a meal, skip that dose of Starlix and \n\nwait until your next meal. \n\n \n\nSwallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. \n\n \n\nEven though you are taking medicines for your diabetes, it is important to keep following the diet \n\nand/or exercise programme your doctor has recommended for you. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Starlix than you should \n\nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets, or if someone else takes your tablets, talk to a doctor \n\nor pharmacist immediately. Medical attention may be necessary. If you experience symptoms of low \n\nblood sugar (listed in section 4, “Possible side effects”), eat or drink something containing sugar. \n\n \n\nIf you feel as if you are about to have a severe hypoglycaemic attack (which may lead to loss of \n\nconsciousness or seizure), call for urgent medical help – or make sure that someone else does this for \n\nyou. If you have to go to a doctor or hospital, take the pack and this leaflet with you. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Starlix \n\nIf you forget to take a tablet, simply take the next one before your next meal. Do not take a double \n\ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Starlix \n\nContinue to take this medicine as long as your doctor prescribes it so that it can continue to control \n\nyour blood sugar. Do not stop taking Starlix unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
