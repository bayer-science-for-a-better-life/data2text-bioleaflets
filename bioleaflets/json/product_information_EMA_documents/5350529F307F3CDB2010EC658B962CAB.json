This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSkyrizi 75 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 75 mg risankizumab in 0.83 ml solution. \n \nRisankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody selective to the \ninterleukin (IL)-23 protein produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells using recombinant DNA \ntechnology. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nThis medicinal product contains 68.0 mg sorbitol per 150 mg dose. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 150 mg dose, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium free’. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nThe solution is colourless to slightly yellow and clear to slightly opalescent. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSkyrizi is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nSkyrizi is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of psoriasis. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 150 mg (two 75 mg injections) administered by subcutaneous injection at \nweek 0, week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. \n \nConsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response \nafter 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve \nwith continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMissed dose \n \nIf a dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, dosing should be \nresumed at the regular scheduled time. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (aged 65 years and over) \n \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \nThere is limited information in subjects aged ≥65 years. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \n \nNo specific studies were conducted to assess the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of Skyrizi. These conditions are generally not expected to have any significant \nimpact on the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies and no dose adjustments are considered \nnecessary (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Skyrizi in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nThere is no relevant use of Skyrizi in children aged below 6 years for the indication of moderate to \nsevere plaque psoriasis. \n \nOverweight patients  \n \nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nSkyrizi is administered by subcutaneous injection. For each dose, the injections should be \nadministered at different anatomic locations (such as thighs or abdomen), and not into areas where the \nskin is tender, bruised, erythematous, indurated or affected by psoriasis. Administration of Skyrizi in \nthe upper, outer arm may only be performed by a healthcare professional or caregiver.  \n \nPatients may self-inject Skyrizi after training in subcutaneous injection technique. Patients should be \ninstructed to inject 2 pre-filled syringes for the full 150 mg dose and to read the ‘Instructions for use’ \nprovided in the package leaflet before administration. \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nClinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nInfections \n \nRisankizumab may increase the risk of infection. \n \nIn patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, or known risk factors for infection, \nrisankizumab should be used with caution. Treatment with risankizumab should not be initiated in \npatients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately \ntreated. \n \nPatients treated with risankizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of \nclinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not \nresponding to standard therapy for the infection, the patient should be closely monitored and \nrisankizumab should not be administered until the infection resolves. \n  \nTuberculosis \n \nPrior to initiating treatment with risankizumab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) \ninfection. Patients receiving risankizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. \nAnti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating risankizumab in patients with a past history of \nlatent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. \n \nImmunisations  \n \nPrior to initiating therapy with risankizumab, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be \nconsidered according to current immunisation guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination \n(viral or bacterial), it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with \nrisankizumab. Patients treated with risankizumab should not receive live vaccines during treatment \nand for at least 21 weeks after treatment (see section 5.2).  \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nIf a serious hypersensivity reaction occurs, administration of risankizumab should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nThis medicinal product contains 68.0 mg sorbitol per 150 mg dose. \nThe additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and \ndietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 150 mg dose, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nRisankizumab is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination. Drug \ninteractions between risankizumab and inhibitors, inducers, or substrates of drug metabolising \nenzymes are not expected and no dose adjustment is needed (see section 5.2). \n \nConcomitant immunosuppressive therapy or phototherapy \n \nThe safety and efficacy of risankizumab in combination with immunosuppressants, including \nbiologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment \nand for at least 21 weeks after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of \nrisankizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects \nwith respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of \nrisankizumab during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether risankizumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted \nin breast milk during the first few days after birth, which decreases to low concentrations soon \nafterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. A \ndecision should be made whether to discontinue/abstain from risankizumab therapy, taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of risankizumab therapy to the \nwoman. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of risankizumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRisankizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections, which occurred in \n13% of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions for risankizumab from clinical studies (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system \norgan class and are based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 1:  List of adverse reactions in clinical studies \n \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reactions \nInfections and \ninfestations \n \n\nVery common Upper respiratory \ninfectionsa \n\nCommon Tinea infectionsb\nUncommon Folliculitis\n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nCommon Headachec\n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nCommon Pruritus \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nCommon Fatigued\nInjection site reactionse \n\na  Includes: respiratory tract infection (viral, bacterial or unspecified), sinusitis \n(including acute), rhinitis, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis (including viral), tonsillitis \n\nb Includes: tinea pedis, tinea cruris, body tinea, tinea versicolor, tinea manuum, \nonychomycosis \n\nc  Includes: headache, tension headache, sinus headache \nd  Includes: fatigue, asthenia \ne Includes: injection site bruising, erythema, haematoma, haemorrhage, irritation, \n\npain, pruritus, reaction, swelling \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections \n \nOver the entire psoriasis programme including long-term exposure to risankizumab, the rate of \ninfections was 75.5 events per 100 subject-years. The majority of cases were non-serious and mild to \nmoderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of risankizumab. The rate of serious infections \nwas 1.7 events per 100 subject-years (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity with risankizumab. The \ndetection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. \n \nFor subjects treated with risankizumab at the recommended clinical dose for up to 52 weeks in \npsoriasis clinical trials, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies were \ndetected in 24% (263/1,079) and 14% (150/1,079) of evaluated subjects, respectively. \n \nFor most subjects, antibodies to risankizumab including neutralising antibodies were not associated \nwith changes in clinical response or safety. Among the few subjects (approximately 1%; 7/1,000 at \nweek 16 and 6/598 at week 52) with high antibody titers (>128), clinical response appeared to be \nreduced. The incidence of injection site reactions is numerically higher in the anti-drug antibody-\npositive compared with anti-drug antibody-negative groups over short-term (16 weeks: 2.7% vs 1.3%) \nand longer term treatment (>52 weeks: 5.0% vs 3.3%). The injection site reactions were all mild to \nmoderate in severity, none were serious, and none led to discontinuation of risankizumab. \n \nElderly \n \nThere is limited safety information in subjects aged ≥65 years. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n7 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms \nof adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC18 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRisankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds \nwith high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine without binding to IL-\n12 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex. IL-23 is a cytokine that is involved in \ninflammatory and immune responses. By blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor, risankizumab \ninhibits IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of proinflammatory cytokines.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn a study of subjects with psoriasis, expression of genes associated with the IL-23/IL-17 axis was \ndecreased in the skin after single doses of risankizumab. Reductions in epidermal thickness, \ninfiltration of inflammatory cells, and expression of psoriatic disease markers were also observed in \npsoriatic lesions. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of risankizumab was assessed in 2,109 subjects with moderate to severe \nplaque psoriasis in four multicentre, randomised, double-blind studies (ULTIMMA-1, ULTIMMA-2, \nIMMHANCE, and IMMVENT). Enrolled subjects were 18 years of age and older with plaque \npsoriasis who had a body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥10%, a static Physician Global \nAssessment (sPGA) score of ≥3 in the overall assessment (plaque thickness/induration, erythema, and \nscaling) of psoriasis on a severity scale of 0 to 4, a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score \n≥12, and who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. \n \nOverall, subjects had a median baseline PASI score of 17.8, a median BSA of 20.0%, and a median \nbaseline DLQI score of 13.0. Baseline sPGA score was severe in 19.3% of subjects and moderate in \n80.7% of subjects. A total of 9.8% of study subjects had a history of diagnosed psoriatic arthritis. \n \nAcross all studies, 30.9% of subjects were naïve to any systemic therapy (including non-biologic and \nbiologic), 38.1% had received prior phototherapy or photochemotherapy, 48.3% had received prior \nnon‐biologic systemic therapy, 42.1% had received prior biologic therapy, and 23.7% had received at \nleast one anti-TNF alpha agent for the treatment of psoriasis. \n \nULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2 \n \nULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2 enrolled 997 subjects (598 randomised to risankizumab 150 mg, 199 \nto ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg [according to baseline weight], and 200 to placebo).

Subjects who were \noriginally on risankizumab and had a sPGA response of clear or almost clear at week 28 were re-\nrandomised to continue risankizumab every 12 weeks or have treatment withdrawn. \n \nAt week 16, risankizumab was superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of sPGA of clear or \nalmost clear (83.5% risankizumab vs 7.0% placebo) and PASI 90 (73.2% risankizumab vs 2.0% \nplacebo). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nOf the 31 subjects from the IMMHANCE study with latent tuberculosis (TB) who did not receive \nprophylaxis during the study, none developed active TB during the mean follow-up of 55 weeks on \nrisankizumab. \n \nAmong subjects with sPGA of clear or almost clear at week 28 in IMMHANCE, 81.1% (90/111) of \nsubjects re-randomised to continued treatment with risankizumab maintained this response at week \n104 compared to 7.1% (16/225) who were re-randomised to withdrawal from risankizumab. Of these \nsubjects, 63.1% (70/111) of subjects re-randomised to continued treatment with risankizumab \nachieved a sPGA clear response at week 104 compared to 2.2% (5/225) who were re-randomised to \nwithdrawal from risankizumab. \n \nIMMVENT \n \nIMMVENT enrolled 605 subjects (301 randomised to risankizumab and 304 to adalimumab). Subjects \nrandomised to risankizumab received 150 mg of treatment at week 0, week 4 and every 12 weeks \nthereafter. Subjects randomised to adalimumab received 80 mg at week 0, 40 mg at week 1 and 40 mg \nevery other week through week 15. Starting at week 16, subjects who were receiving adalimumab \ncontinued or switched treatment based on response: \n <PASI 50 were switched to risankizumab \n PASI 50 to <PASI 90 were re-randomised to either continue adalimumab or switch to \n\nrisankizumab \n PASI 90 continued to receive adalimumab \n\n \nResults are presented in Table 4. \n \nTable 4:  Efficacy and quality of life results at week 16 in adults with plaque psoriasis in \nIMMVENT \n Risankizumab \n\n(N=301) \nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab \n(N=304) \nn (%) \n\nsPGA of clear or almost cleara 252 (83.7)  183 (60.2)  \nPASI 75 273 (90.7)  218 (71.7)  \nPASI 90a 218 (72.4)  144 (47.4)  \nPASI 100 120 (39.9)  70 (23.0)  \nDLQI 0 or 1b 198 (65.8) 148 (48.7) \nAll comparisons achieved p<0.001  \na Co-primary endpoints \nb No impact on health-related quality of life \n \nFor subjects who had PASI 50 to <PASI 90 with adalimumab at week 16 and were re-randomised, \ndifferences in PASI 90 response rates between switching to risankizumab and continuing adalimumab \nwere noted 4 weeks after re-randomisation (49.1% vs 26.8%, respectively).  \n \nResults 28 weeks after re-randomisation are presented in Table 5 and Figure 2. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 5:  Efficacy results 28 weeks after re-randomisation in IMMVENT \n Switched to \n\nRisankizumab \n(N=53) \nn (%) \n\nContinued on \nAdalimumab \n\n(N=56) \nn (%) \n\nPASI 90 35 (66.0)  12 (21.4)  \nPASI 100 21 (39.6)  4 (7.1)  \nAll comparisons achieved p<0.001  \n \nFigure 2:  Time course of PASI 90 after re-randomisation in IMMVENT \n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nt o\n\nf S\nub\n\nje\nct\n\ns \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Weeks After Re-Randomisation \nADA/ADA: Subjects randomised to adalimumab and continued on adalimumab \nADA/RZB: Subjects randomised to adalimumab and switched to risankizumab \np<0.05 at week 4 and p<0.001 at each time point beginning at week 8 \n\n \nIn 270 patients who switched from adalimumab to risankizumab without a washout period, the safety \nprofile of risankizumab was similar to that in patients who initiated risankizumab after wash out of any \nprior systemic therapies. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nrisankizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of plaque psoriasis \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nRisankizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increase in exposure across \ndose ranges of 18 to 300 mg and 0.25 to 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously, and 200 to 1,200 mg \nand 0.01 to 5 mg/kg administered intravenously. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous dosing of risankizumab, peak plasma concentrations were achieved between \n3-14 days after dosing with an estimated absolute bioavailability of 89%. With dosing of 150 mg at \nweek 0, week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter, estimated steady-state peak and trough plasma \nconcentrations are 12 and 2 µg/mL, respectively.  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean (±standard deviation) steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of risankizumab was 11.4 \n(±2.7) L in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis, indicating that the distribution of risankizumab is \nprimarily confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTherapeutic IgG monoclonal antibodies are typically degraded into small peptides and amino acids via \ncatabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgGs. Risankizumab is not expected to be \nmetabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nElimination \n \nThe mean (±standard deviation) systemic clearance (CL) of risankizumab was 0.3 (±0.1) L/day in \nPhase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis. The mean terminal elimination half-life of risankizumab \nranged from 28 to 29 days in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis. \n \nAs an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is not expected to be filtered by glomerular filtration \nin the kidneys or to be excreted as an intact molecule in the urine. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nRisankizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with approximately dose-proportional increases in \nsystemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) in the evaluated dose ranges of 18 to 300 mg or 0.25 to 1 mg/kg \nsubcutaneous administration in healthy subjects or subjects with psoriasis. \n \nDrug interactions \n \nA drug interaction study was conducted in subjects with plaque psoriasis to assess the effect of \nrepeated administration of risankizumab on the pharmacokinetics of cytochrome P450 (CYP) sensitive \nprobe substrates. The exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), \nomeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), metoprolol (CYP2D6 substrate) and midazolam (CYP3A substrate) \nfollowing risankizumab treatment were comparable to their exposures prior to risankizumab treatment, \nindicating no clinically meaningful drug interactions through these enzymes. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that risankizumab exposure was not impacted by \nconcomitant medications (metformin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, amlodipine, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylate \nand levothyroxine) used by some subjects with plaque psoriasis during the clinical studies. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of risankizumab in paediatric subjects has not been established. \n \nElderly patients \n \nOf the 2,234 subjects with plaque psoriasis exposed to risankizumab, 243 were 65 years or older and \n24 subjects were 75 years or older. No overall differences in risankizumab exposure were observed \nbetween older and younger subjects who received risankizumab. \n \nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \n \nNo specific studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of risankizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, serum creatinine \n\n\n\n14 \n\nlevels, creatinine clearance, or hepatic function markers (ALT/AST/bilirubin) did not have a \nmeaningful impact on risankizumab clearance in subjects with psoriasis. \n \nAs an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and \nis not expected to undergo metabolism via hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes or renal elimination. \n \nBody weight \n \nRisankizumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases which may \nresult in reduced efficacy in subjects with high body weight (>130 kg). However, this observation is \nbased on a limited number of subjects. No dose adjustment based on body weight is currently \nrecommended. \n \nGender or race \n \nThe clearance of risankizumab was not significantly influenced by gender or race in adult subjects \nwith plaque psoriasis. No clinically meaningful differences in risankizumab exposure were observed \nin Chinese or Japanese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects in a clinical pharmacokinetic study.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies including \nsafety pharmacology evaluations, and a reproductive and developmental toxicity study in cynomolgus \nmonkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week (producing exposures of about 70 times the clinical \nexposure at maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). \n \nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with risankizumab. In a 26-week \nchronic toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week (about 70 times the \nclinical exposure at the MRHD), there were no pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions observed and no \nadverse immunotoxicity or cardiovascular effects were noted . \n \n \n6.
