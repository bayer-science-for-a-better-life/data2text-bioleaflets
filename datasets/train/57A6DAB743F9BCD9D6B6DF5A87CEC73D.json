Vigabatrin should be gradually withdrawn under close \nmedical supervision. \n \nRenal impairment \nSince vigabatrin is eliminated via the kidneys, caution should be exercised when administering the \nmedicinal product to patients with creatinine clearance less than 60 ml/min. Adjustment of dose \nshould be considered. Such patients may respond to a lower maintenance dose. Patients should be \nmonitored for adverse reactions such as sedation or confusion (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \nVigabatrin is not metabolised by hepatic enzymes, hence there is no need of adjustment of dose or \nfrequency of administration. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThere is no relevant use of Kigabeq in neonates (below 27 days of age) in the indication \u201cinfantile \nspasms\u201d and in children and adolescents above 7 years of age in the indication \u201cresistant partial \nepilepsy\u201d (focal onset seizures). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nKigabeq is for oral or gastric use and may be taken before or after meals.  \nGastric administration should be used for children who cannot swallow, but can be fed by enteral \nroute. \nThe method of administration will be determined by a physician specialised in epileptology, neurology \nor paediatric neurology. \n \nFor instructions on dissolution and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \nOral administration \nSince no stability studies have been performed with other solvents than water, for preparing oral \nsolution only water should be used. When the tablets are fully disintegrated, the whole content of \nsolution should be administered straight away to the child directly from the drinking glass. If there is a \nrisk of regurgitation or if the child is not old enough to drink from a glass, the whole content of \nsolution should be withdrawn with a syringe for oral use, the end of the syringe should be put in the \nmouth of the child and gently pushed on the plunger. \n\nOnce the child has entirely drunk the medicine solution, the drinking glass should be rinsed with one \nor two teaspoons of water (approximately 5 or 10 ml) and dispensed to the child by the same way. \n \nGastric administration \nFor patients who cannot swallow, administration of Kigabeq using a gastric tube is possible.  \nTablets are disintegrated in approximately 5 or 10 ml of water and the resulting solution is introduced \ninto the tube using an adapted syringe. The gastric tube should be rinsed with 10 ml of water. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nVisual field defects (VFD) have been reported in patients receiving vigabatrin with a high prevalence \n(about 1/3 of patients). Frequencies found in an open clinical study are presented in section 4.8. The \nonset is usually after months to years of vigabatrin therapy. The degree of visual field constriction may \nbe severe and this may have practical consequences for the patient. Vigabatrin can cause permanent \nvision loss. \n \nMost of the patients with perimetry-confirmed defects have been asymptomatic. Hence, this \nundesirable effect can only be reliably detected by systematic perimetry which is usually possible only \nin patients with a developmental age of more than 9 years. For younger patients electroretinography \nshould be used (see Visual Field Defects). \nAvailable data suggests that visual field defects are irreversible even after discontinuation of \nvigabatrin. A deterioration of VFD after the treatment is discontinued cannot be excluded. \n \nTherefore, vigabatrin should only be used after careful benefit/ risk assessment compared with \nalternatives. \n \nVigabatrin is not recommended for use in patients with any pre-existing clinically significant visual \nfield defect. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPatients should undergo systematic screening examination when starting vigabatrin and at regular \nintervals for detection of visual field defects. Visual field testing should continue at 6 month intervals \nfor the whole duration of treatment. The assessment must be continued 6 to 12 months after the \ndiscontinuation of therapy (see Visual Field Defects).  \n \nVisual Field Defects (VFD) \n \nBased on available data, the usual pattern is a concentric constriction of the visual field of both eyes, \nwhich is generally more marked nasally than temporally. In the central visual field (within 30 degree \nof eccentricity), frequently an annular nasal defect is seen. However, the VFDs reported in patients \nreceiving vigabatrin have ranged from mild to severe. Severe cases are potentially disabling.  \n \nMost patients with perimetry-confirmed defects had not previously spontaneously noticed any \nsymptoms, even in cases where a severe defect was observed in perimetry. Available evidence \nsuggests that the VFD is irreversible even after discontinuation of vigabatrin. A deterioration of VFD \nafter the treatment is discontinued cannot be excluded. \nPooled data from prevalence surveys suggest that as many as 1/3 of patients receiving vigabatrin \ntherapy have VFDs. Males may be at greater risk than females. Frequencies found in an open clinical \nstudy are presented in section 4.8. A possible association between the risk of visual field defects and \nthe extent of vigabatrin exposure, both in terms of daily dose (from 1 gram to more than 3 grams) and \nin terms of duration of treatment (maximum during the first three years) has been shown in this study. \n \nAll patients should have ophthalmological consultation before or shortly after the initiation of \nvigabatrin treatment.  \n \nPerimetry is seldom possible in children less than 9 years of developmental age. The risks of treatment \nmust be very carefully weighed against possible benefit in children. Currently, there is no established \nmethod to diagnose or exclude visual field defects in children in whom a standardised perimetry \ncannot be performed. Frequency and severity have only been indirectly characterised in this \npopulation on the presence of electroretinogram or visual evoked potential anomalies. \n \nElectroretinography is recommended in infants and children who are unable to cooperate with \nperimetry. Based on the available data the first oscillatory potential and 30 Hz flicker responses of the \nelectroretinogram appear to be correlated with a vigabatrin associated VFD. These responses are \ndelayed and reduced beyond the normal limits. Such changes have not been seen in vigabatrin treated \npatients without a VFD. \n \nThe parents and/or caregivers must be given a thorough description of the frequency and implications \nof the development of VFD during vigabatrin treatment. \nVFD may not be detected until it is severe and undetected moderate defects may affect child integrity. \nTherefore, vision assessment is required at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting treatment) and \nat least every 6 months while on therapy. The assessment must be continued 6 to 12 months after the \ndiscontinuation of therapy.  \n \nAvailable data suggests that visual field defects are irreversible.  \n \nIf a visual field constriction is observed during follow-up, consideration should be given to gradual \ndiscontinuation of vigabatrin. If the decision to continue treatment is made, consideration should be \ngiven to more frequent follow-up (perimetry) in order to detect progression or sight threatening \ndefects. \n \nVigabatrin should not be used concomitantly with other retinotoxic medicinal products.  \n \nNeurologic and psychiatric conditions  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn view of the results of the animal safety studies (see section 5.3) it is recommended that patients \ntreated with vigabatrin are closely observed for adverse reactions on neurological function. \n \nRare reports of encephalopathic symptoms such as marked sedation, stupor and confusion in \nassociation with non-specific slow wave activity on electroencephalogram have been described soon \nafter the initiation of vigabatrin treatment. Risk factors for the development of these reactions include \nhigher than recommended starting dose, faster dose escalation at higher steps than recommended and \nrenal failure. These events have been reversible following dose reduction or discontinuation of \nvigabatrin (see section 4.8).  \n \nAbnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging signals \nAbnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) signal changes characterised by increased T2 signal \nand restricted diffusion in a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and \ncerebellum have been observed in some infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms. In a \nretrospective epidemiologic study in infants with infantile spasms (N=205), the prevalence of these \nchanges was 22% in vigabatrin treated patients versus 4% in patients treated with other therapies.  \n \nIn the study above, in post-marketing experience, and in published literature reports, these changes \ngenerally resolved with discontinuation of treatment. In a few patients, the lesion resolved despite \ncontinued use.  \n \nMovement disorders including dystonia, dyskinesia and hypertonia, have been reported in patients \ntreated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms. The benefit/risk ratio of vigabatrin should be evaluated on \nan individual patient basis. If new movement disorders occur during treatment with vigabatrin, \nconsideration should be given to dose reduction or a gradual discontinuation of treatment. \n \nSome patients may experience an increase in seizure frequency or the onset of new types of seizures \nwith vigabatrin (see section 4.8). Patients with myoclonic seizures may be particularly susceptible to \nthis effect. New onset myoclonus and exacerbation of existing myoclonus may occur in rare cases. \nThese phenomena may also be the consequence of an overdose, a decrease in plasma concentrations of \nconcomitant antiepileptic treatment, or a paradoxical effect.  \n \nAbrupt withdrawal may lead to rebound seizures. If a patient is to be withdrawn from vigabatrin \ntreatment, it is recommended that this is done by gradual dose reduction over a 2- to 4-week period.  \n \nVigabatrin should be used with caution in patients with a history of psychosis, depression or \nbehavioural problems. Psychiatric events (e.g., agitation, depression, abnormal thinking, paranoid \nreactions) have been reported during vigabatrin treatment. These events occurred in patients with and \nwithout a psychiatric history and were usually reversible when vigabatrin doses were reduced or \ngradually discontinued. \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of \nantiepileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and \nbehaviour. The mechanism of this effect is not known and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for vigabatrin.  \n \nTherefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviour, and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical \nadvice immediately should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \nRenal impairment \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nSince vigabatrin is eliminated via the kidneys, caution should be exercised in patients with a creatinine \nclearance of less than 60 ml/min. These patients should be monitored closely for undesirable effects \nsuch as sedation and confusion (see section 4.2). \n \nInterference with serological testing \n \nVigabatrin may lead to a decrease in measured plasma activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \nto a lesser extent, aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The magnitude of suppression for ALT has been \nreported to vary between 30% and 100%. Therefore, these liver tests may be quantitatively unreliable \nin patients taking vigabatrin (see section 4.8). \n \nVigabatrin may increase the amount of amino acids in the urine possibly leading to a false positive test \nfor certain rare genetic metabolic disorders (e.g., alpha aminoadipic aciduria). \n \nRisk of medication error \nBecause both tablet strengths (100 mg and 500 mg) can be used concomitantly there may be confusion \nbetween the tablets or tablet halves administered with a risk of incorrect dosing. Special attention \nshould be paid to the tablet size to correctly identify the strength. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nAs vigabatrin is neither metabolised, nor protein bound and is not an inducer of hepatic cytochrome \nP450 metabolising-enzymes, interactions with other medicinal products are unlikely. However, during \ncontrolled clinical studies, a gradual reduction of 16-33% in the plasma concentration of phenytoin has \nbeen observed. The exact nature of this interaction is presently not understood, however, in the \nmajority of cases it is unlikely to be of therapeutic significance. \n \nThe plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and sodium valproate have also been \nmonitored during controlled clinical trials and no clinically significant interactions have been detected. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThis medicinal product is not intended for use in women of child-bearing potential. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nThis medicinal product is not intended for use in women who are breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nFertility studies in rats have shown no effect on male and female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKigabeq has major influence on the ability to perform hazardous activities. \n \nIn view of the fact that drowsiness has been observed in clinical trials with vigabatrin, patients should \nbe warned of this possibility at the start of treatment. \nVisual field defects which can significantly affect the ability to perform hazardous activities have been \nfrequently reported in association with vigabatrin. Patients should be evaluated for the presence of \nvisual field defects (see also section 4.4). Special care should be taken with young patients cycling, \nclimbing or performing any other hazardous activity. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reaction related to vigabatrin are visual field defects (ranging \nfrom mild to severe and occurring usually after months to years of vigabatrin therapy), psychiatric \ndisorders such as agitation, excitation, aggression, nervousness, depression, paranoid reaction, nervous \nsystem disorders such as marked sedation, stupor and confusion. Rarely seen events include suicide \nattempts, encephalopathy and retinal disorders.  \n \nSome patients may experience an increase in seizure frequency, including status epilepticus with \nvigabatrin. Patients with myoclonic seizures may be particularly susceptible to this effect. New onset \nmyoclonus and exacerbation of existing myoclonus may occur in rare cases. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below have been reported during pre- or post-approval use of vigabatrin \nworldwide.

These reactions occurred in \npatients with and without a psychiatric history and were usually reversible when vigabatrin doses were \nreduced or gradually discontinued (see section 4.4). Depression was a common psychiatric reaction in \nclinical trials but seldom required discontinuation of vigabatrin.  \nRare reports of encephalopathic symptoms such as marked sedation, stupor and confusion in \nassociation with non-specific slow wave activity on electroencephalogram have been described soon \nafter the initiation of vigabatrin treatment. Such reactions have been fully reversible following dose \nreduction or discontinuation of vigabatrin (see section 4.4).  \nLaboratory data indicate that vigabatrin treatment does not lead to renal toxicity. Decreases in ALT \nand AST, which are considered to be a result of inhibition of these aminotransferases by vigabatrin, \nhave been observed. Chronic treatment with vigabatrin may be associated with a slight decrease in \nhaemoglobin which rarely attains significance. \n \nAsymptomatic and transient Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) abnormalities in the brain have been \nobserved in some infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms. The clinical significance of these \nMRI abnormalities is unknown. As routine MRI surveillance of this paediatric population is not \nrecommended, the frequency of MRI abnormalities cannot be reliably estimated from the available \ndata. Movement disorders either alone or in association with abnormalities in MRI have been reported \nin patients treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms but their frequency is not known. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nVery common: excitation, agitation \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nVigabatrin overdose has been reported. When provided, doses were most commonly between 7.5 to \n30 g; however, ingestions up to 90 g have been reported. Nearly half of the cases involved multiple \ndrug ingestions. When reported, the most common symptoms included drowsiness or coma. Other less \nfrequently reported symptoms included vertigo, headache, psychosis, respiratory depression or apnoea, \nbradycardia, hypotension, agitation, irritability, confusion, abnormal behaviour, and speech disorder.  \n \nManagement \n \nThere is no specific antidote. The usual supportive measures should be employed. Measures to remove \nunabsorbed medicinal product should be considered. Activated charcoal has been shown to not \nsignificantly adsorb vigabatrin in an in vitro study. The effectiveness of haemodialysis in the treatment \nof vigabatrin overdose is unknown. In isolated case reports in renal failure patients receiving \ntherapeutic doses of vigabatrin, haemodialysis reduced vigabatrin plasma concentrations by 40% to \n60%. \n \n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiepileptics, fatty acid derivatives, ATC code: N03AG04 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nVigabatrin is a selective irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, the enzyme responsible for the \nbreakdown of GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid). Vigabatrin increases the concentration of GABA, \nthe major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nControlled and long-term clinical trials have shown that vigabatrin is an effective anticonvulsant agent \nwhen given as first line treatment in patients with infantile spasms and as add-on therapy in patients \nwith epilepsy not controlled satisfactorily by conventional therapy. This efficacy is particularly \nmarked in patients with seizures of partial origin. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAdults \n \nAbsorption \nVigabatrin is a water soluble compound and it is rapidly and completely absorbed from the \ngastrointestinal tract. Food administration does not alter the extent of vigabatrin absorption. Time to \nreach maximum plasma concentrations (tmax) is approximately 1 hour. \n \nDistribution \nVigabatrin is widely distributed with an apparent volume of distribution slightly greater than total \nbody water. Binding to plasma proteins is negligible. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations \nare linearly related to dose over the recommended dose range. \n \nBiotransformation \nVigabatrin is not significantly metabolised. No metabolites have been identified in plasma. \n \nElimination \nVigabatrin is eliminated via renal excretion with a terminal half-life of 5-8 hours. Oral clearance \n(Cl/F) of vigabatrin is approximately 7 l/h (i.e. 0.10 l/h/kg). Approximately 70% of a single oral dose \nwas recovered as unchanged drug in the urine in the first 24 hours post-dose. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \nThere is no direct correlation between plasma concentration and efficacy. The duration of the effect of \nthe medicinal product is dependent on the GABA transaminase re-synthesis rate. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPharmacokinetic properties of vigabatrin have been investigated in groups of six neonates (age 15-\n26 days), six infants (age 5-22 months) and six children (age 4.6-14.2 years) with refractory epilepsy.  \n \nAfter administration of a single 37-50 mg/kg dose of an oral solution vigabatrin tmax was \napproximately 2.5 hours in neonates and infants, and 1 hour in children. Mean terminal half-life of \nvigabatrin was about 7.5 hours in neonates, 5.7 hours in infants and 5.5 hours in children. The mean \nCl/F of active S-enantiomer of vigabatrin in infants and children was 0.591 l/h/kg and 0.446 l/h/kg \nrespectively. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAnimal safety studies carried out in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey have indicated that vigabatrin has \nno significant adverse reactions on the liver, kidney, lung, heart or gastrointestinal tract.  \n \nIn the brain, microvacuolation due to intramyelinic oedema has been observed in white matter tracts of \nrat, mouse and dog at doses of 30-50 mg/kg/day. In the monkey these lesions are minimal or \nequivocal. In both rat and dog they were reversible on stopping vigabatrin treatment and even \nregressed with continued treatment.  \n \nVigabatrin-associated retinotoxicity has been observed in 80-100% of albino rats at the dose of \n300 mg/kg/day orally, but not in pigmented rats, dogs or monkeys. The retinal changes in albino rats \nwere characterised as focal or multifocal disorganisation of the outer nuclear layer while the other \nlayers of retina were not affected.  \n \nAnimal experiments have shown that vigabatrin has no negative influence on fertility or pup \ndevelopment. No teratogenicity was seen in rats in doses up to 150 mg/kg (3 times the human dose) or \nin rabbits in doses up to 100 mg/kg. However, in rabbits, a slight increase in the incidence of cleft \npalate at doses of 150-200 mg/kg was seen. \n \nStudies with vigabatrin revealed no evidence of mutagenic or carcinogenic effects.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for your child. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as your child\u2019s. \n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Kigabeq is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before your child takes Kigabeq \n3. How to give Kigabeq  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Kigabeq  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Kigabeq is and what it is used for \n \nKigabeq contains vigabatrin and it is used for treating infants and children aged from 1 month to less \nthan 7 years. It is used to treat infantile spasms (West\u2019s syndrome) or, together with other epilepsy \nmedicines to treat partial epilepsy that is not controlled well enough with current treatment.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child takes Kigabeq  \n \nDo not give Kigabeq: \n- if your child is allergic to vigabatrin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your child\u2019s doctor before you give Kigabeq if your child: \n- has or has had depression or any other psychiatric illness in the past \n- has had any kidney problems as he/she could develop symptoms like sedation or confusion  \n- has had any eye problems. \n \n\nVisual field loss (loss of sight from the edges of your child\u2019s field of vision) may occur during \ntreatment with vigabatrin. You should discuss this possibility with the doctor before your child begins \ntreatment and the doctor will tell you how to detect this side effect. This visual field loss may be \nsevere and permanent, so it must be detected early to avoid progression. Worsening of visual field loss \nmay continue after stopping treatment. It is important that you tell the doctor promptly if there is any \n\n\n\n30 \n\nchange in your child\u2019s vision. The doctor will check your child\u2019s visual field before your child starts \ntaking vigabatrin and carry on checking it at regular intervals during the treatment. \n \nIf your child develops symptoms like sleepiness, reduced consciousness and movements (stupor) or \nconfusion, tell your child\u2019s doctor who may reduce the dose or stop Kigabeq treatment. \n \nA small number of people being treated with epilepsy medicines such as vigabatrin have had thoughts \nof harming or killing themselves. Look for symptoms suggestive of such thoughts: disturbed sleep, \nloss of appetite or weight, isolation, loss of interest for favorite activities. \nIf at any time your child has had these symptoms, immediately contact child\u2019s doctor. \n \nMovement disorders can occur in young infants treated for infantile spasms (West\u2019s syndrome). If you \nsee unusual movements in your child, tell your child\u2019s doctor who may change the treatment. \n \nTell your child\u2019s doctor if your child has had or is going to perform laboratory tests because this \nmedicine may lead to abnormal results. \n \nYou must speak to your child\u2019s doctor if your child\u2019s condition does not improve within a month of \nstarting vigabatrin.  \n \nChildren \nDo not give this medicine to children less than 1 month of age or more than 7 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Kigabeq \nTell your child\u2019s doctor if the child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nKigabeq should not be used in combination with other medicines that may have side effects related to \nthe eye. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nThis medicine is not intended for use in women of child-bearing potential or in breast-feeding women. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour child should not ride a bicycle, climb or take part in hazardous activity if the child has symptoms \nlike drowsiness or dizziness with Kigabeq. Visual disorders, which can affect the ability to cycle, \nclimb or take part in hazardous activity, have occurred in some patients taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to give Kigabeq \n \nAlways give this medicine to your child exactly as the doctor has told you. Check with the doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDose \nNever change the dose yourself. The doctor works out the dose individually for your child, taking \naccount of the child\u2019s body weight. \n \nKigabeq is available as 100 mg or 500 mg tablets which can be given together to make up the right \ndose for your child. Always check the label and the size of the tablets to make sure you are giving the \nright dose. \n \nIn infantile spasms (West\u2019s Syndrome), the recommended starting dose is 50 milligrams per kilogram \nbodyweight daily. In resistant partial epilepsy (focal onset seizures), the recommended starting dose is \n40 milligrams per kilogram daily. The doctor will adjust the dose during treatment as necessary. If \nyour child has kidney problems, the doctor may prescribe a smaller dose. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nThe following table gives the number of Kigabeq tablets to give to your child according to the dose \nprescribed by your child\u2019s doctor.  \n \n\nDose \n(mg per day) \n\nNumber of tablets (strength) \nMorning  \n\nNumber of tablets (strength) \nEvening \n\n150 Half a tablet (100 mg) One tablet (100 mg) \n200 One tablet (100 mg) One tablet (100 mg) \n250 One tablet (100 mg) One and a half tablets (100 mg) \n300 One and a half tablets (100 mg) One and a half tablets (100 mg) \n350 One and a half tablets (100 mg) Two tablets (100 mg) \n400 Two tablets (100 mg) Two tablets (100 mg) \n450 Two tablets (100 mg) Two and a half tablets (100 mg) \n\n500 \nHalf a tablet (500 mg) or two and a half tablets (100 \n\nmg) \nHalf a tablet (500 mg) or two and a half tablets (100 \n\nmg) \n550 Two and a half tablets (100 mg) Three tablets (100 mg) \n600 Three tablets (100 mg) Three tablets (100 mg) \n650 Three tablets (100 mg) Three and a half tablets (100 mg) \n700 Three and a half tablets (100 mg) Three and a half tablets (100 mg) \n750 Half a tablet (500 mg) One tablet (500 mg) \n800 Four tablets (100 mg) Four tablets (100 mg) \n850 Four tablets (100 mg) Four and a half tablets (100 mg) \n900 Four and a half tablets (100 mg) Four and a half tablets (100 mg) \n950 Four and a half tablets (100 mg) One tablet (500 mg) \n\n1000 One tablet (500 mg) One tablet (500 mg) \n1100 One tablet (500 mg)  One tablet (500 mg) and one tablet (100 mg) \n1200 One tablet (500 mg) and one tablet (100 mg) One tablet (500 mg) and one tablet (100 mg) \n1300 One tablet (500 mg) and one tablet (100 mg) One tablet (500 mg) and two tablets (100 mg) \n1400 One tablet (500 mg) and two tablets (100 mg) One tablet (500 mg) and two tablets (100 mg) \n1500 One and a half tablets (500 mg) One and a half tablets (500 mg) \n\n \nHow to give this medicine \nAsk your child\u2019s doctor to show you how to give this medicine. Check with the doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nKigabeq is to be given by mouth and may be taken before or after meals. The tablet can be cut into \nequal halves. \n \nUse only water to prepare solution. \n \n\u2022 Pour one or two teaspoonfuls (about 5 to 10 ml) of water into a drinking glass or beaker \n\u2022 Add the right dose of Kigabeq tablets (as whole or half tablets) to the water \n\u2022 Wait until the tablet has broken down completely. This takes less than a minute but you can speed \n\nit up by stirring the mixture gently by hand \n\u2022 The mixture will be whitish and cloudy. This is normal and the cloudiness is because the tablet \n\ncontains some non-active ingredients that do not dissolve completely \n\u2022 Give the mixture straightway to your child direct from the drinking glass or beaker \n\u2022 If your child cannot drink from the glass or beaker then you can use an oral syringe to gently \n\nsquirt the mixture into your child's mouth, taking care not to cause choking: sit just in front and \nbelow your child in order that he/she has the head leaning forward and administer the mixture \nagainst his cheek \n\n\u2022 Rinse the glass or beaker with one or two teaspoonfuls (about 5 to 10 ml) of water and give this to \nyour child to make sure that the child receives all the medicine \n\n\n\n32 \n\n\u2022 If the child cannot swallow, the mixture can be given through a gastric tube, using a suitable \nsyringe. The tube should be rinsed with 10 ml of water \n\n \nIf your child takes too much Kigabeq \nIf your child accidentally takes too many Kigabeq tablets, tell the doctor immediately or go to your \nnearest hospital or poison information centre. Possible signs of overdose include drowsiness or \nreduced level of consciousness. \n \nIf you forget to give your child Kigabeq \nIf you forget to give your child a dose, give the dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for \nthe next dose, just give one dose. Do not give a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.  \n \nIf you stop giving Kigabeq to your child \nDo not stop giving this medicine without talking to your child\u2019s doctor. If the doctor decides to stop \nthe treatment you will be advised to gradually reduce the dose.

has or has had depression or any other psychiatric illness in the past - has had any kidney problems as he/she could develop symptoms like sedation or confusion - has had any eye problems. visual field loss (loss of sight from the edges of your child's field of vision) may occur during treatment with vigabatrin. you should discuss this possibility with the doctor before your child begins treatment and the doctor will tell you how to detect this side effect. this visual field loss may be severe and permanent, so it must be detected early to avoid progression. worsening of visual field loss may continue after stopping treatment. it is important that you tell the doctor promptly if there is any 30 change in your child's vision. the doctor will check your child's visual field before your child starts taking vigabatrin and carry on checking it at regular intervals during the treatment. if your child develops symptoms like sleepiness, reduced consciousness and movements (stupor) or confusion, tell your child's doctor who may reduce the dose or stop kigabeq treatment. a small number of people being treated with epilepsy medicines such as vigabatrin have had thoughts of harming or killing themselves. look for symptoms suggestive of such thoughts: disturbed sleep, loss of appetite or weight, isolation, loss of interest for favorite activities. if at any time your child has had these symptoms, immediately contact child's doctor. movement disorders can occur in young infants treated for infantile spasms (west's syndrome). if you see unusual movements in your child, tell your child's doctor who may change the treatment. tell your child's doctor if your child has had or is going to perform laboratory tests because this medicine may lead to abnormal results. you must speak to your child's doctor if your child's condition does not improve within a month of starting vigabatrin. children do not give this medicine to children less than 1 month of age or more than 7 years of age. other medicines and kigabeq tell your child's doctor if the child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines. kigabeq should not be used in combination with other medicines that may have side effects related to the eye. pregnancy and breast-feeding this medicine is not intended for use in women of child-bearing potential or in breast-feeding women. driving and using machines your child should not ride a bicycle, climb or take part in hazardous activity if the child has symptoms like drowsiness or dizziness with kigabeq. visual disorders, which can affect the

exactly as the doctor has told you. check with the doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. dose never change the dose yourself. the doctor works out the dose individually for your child, taking account of the child's body weight. kigabeq is available as 100 mg or 500 mg tablets which can be given together to make up the right dose for your child. always check the label and the size of the tablets to make sure you are giving the right dose. in infantile spasms (west's syndrome), the recommended starting dose is 50 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight daily. in resistant partial epilepsy (focal onset seizures), the recommended starting dose is 40 milligrams per kilogram daily. the doctor will adjust the dose during treatment as necessary. if your child has kidney problems, the doctor may prescribe a smaller dose. the following table gives the number of kigabeq tablets to give to your child according to the dose prescribed by your child's doctor. dose (mg per day) number of tablets

show you how to give this medicine. check with the doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. kigabeq is to be given by mouth and may be taken before or after meals. the tablet can be cut into equal halves. use only water to prepare solution. pour one or two teaspoonfuls (about 5 to 10 ml) of water into a drinking glass or beaker add the right dose of kigabeq tablets (as whole or half tablets) to the water wait until the tablet has broken down completely. this takes less than a minute but you can speed it up by stirring the mixture gently by hand the mixture will be whitish and cloudy. this is normal and the cloudiness is because the tablet contains some non-active ingredients that do not dissolve completely give the mixture straightway to your child direct from the drinking glass or beaker if your child cannot drink from the glass or beaker then you can use an oral syringe to gently squirt the mixture into your child's mouth, taking care not to cause choking: sit just in front and below your child in order that he/she has the head leaning forward and administer the mixture against his cheek rinse the glass or beaker with one or two teaspoonfuls (about 5 to 10 ml) of water and give this to your child to make sure that the child receives all the medicine 32 if the child cannot swallow, the mixture can be given through a gastric tube, using a suitable syringe. the tube should be rinsed with 10 ml of water if your child takes too much kigabeq if your child accidentally takes too many kigabeq tablets, tell the doctor immediately or go to your nearest hospital or poison information centre. possible signs of overdose include drowsiness or reduced level of consciousness. if you forget to give your child kigabeq if you forget to give your child a dose, give the dose as soon as you remember. if it is almost time for the next dose, just give one dose. do not give a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. if you stop giving kigabeq to your child do not stop giving this medicine without talking to your child's doctor. if the doctor decides to stop the treatment you will be advised to gradually reduce the dose. do not stop suddenly as this may cause your child's seizures to occur again. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask the doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "kigabeq", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
