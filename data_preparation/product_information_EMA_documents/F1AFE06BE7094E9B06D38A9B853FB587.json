QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nDiphtheria toxoid1 not less than 30 IU \nTetanus toxoid1 not less than 60 IU \nBordetella pertussis (inactivated)2 not less than 4 IU \nHepatitis B surface antigen 2,3 10 micrograms \n \n1 Adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide, hydrated 0.26 milligrams Al3+ \n2 Adsorbed on aluminium phosphate 0.37 milligrams Al3+ \n3 Produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA technology \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nTurbid white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTritanrix HepB is indicated for active immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis B \n(HBV) in infants from 6 weeks onwards (see section 4.2). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.5 ml. \n \nPrimary vaccination: \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses within the first six months of life.  Where HBV \nvaccine is not given at birth, the combined vaccine can be administered beginning as early as 8 weeks of age.  \nWhere there is a high endemicity of HBV, the practice to administer HBV vaccine at birth should be \ncontinued. In these circumstances, vaccination with the combined vaccine should start at 6 weeks of age. \n \nThree vaccine doses must be administered at intervals of at least 4 weeks. \n \nWhen Tritanrix HepB is given according to the 6-10-14 weeks schedule, it is recommended to \nadminister a dose of HBV vaccine at birth to improve protection. \n \nIn the case of children born of known HBV carrier mothers the immunoprophylactic measures for hepatitis B \nshould not be modified. This may require separate vaccination with HBV and DTPw vaccines and also \ninclude the administration of HBIg at birth.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n3 \n\n \nBooster vaccination: \n \nA booster dose with Tritanrix HepB will give rise to increased reactogenicity as would be expected for a \nbooster during the second year of life. In consequence, boostering should follow local recommendations.   \n \nThe administration of a booster dose with trivalent DTP vaccine is recommended before the end of the \nsecond year of life. For long-term protection against HBV, a booster dose of HBV vaccine could also be \nadministered after the first year of life. However, the need for this dose is currently not established. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTritanrix HepB is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. \n \nIt is recommended that in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders the vaccine be administered \nsubcutaneously (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or hepatitis B vaccines. \n \nThe administration of Tritanrix HepB should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile \nillness. \n \nTritanrix HepB is contraindicated if the child has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, \noccurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine.  In these \ncircumstances the vaccination course should be continued with DT and HBV vaccines. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous \nvaccination and possible occurrence of adverse reactions) and a clinical examination. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of \nanaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. For this reason, the vaccinee should \nremain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after vaccination. \n \nIf any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of Tritanrix HepB, the decision to give \nsubsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered. \n\nTemperature of ≥ 40.0 C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. \nCollapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. \nPersistent crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. \nConvulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. \n\nThere may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh \npossible risks.  \n \nAs for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Tritanrix HepB or deferring this vaccination \nshould be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or progression of a severe \nneurological disorder. \nA history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions, a family history of SIDS (Sudden Infant \nDeath Syndrome) and a family history of an adverse reaction following Tritanrix HepB vaccination do not \nconstitute contra-indications. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n4 \n\nHIV infection is not considered as a contra-indication for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and HBV vaccination. \nThe expected immunological response may not be obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients, \ne.g. patients on immunosuppressive therapy. \n \nTritanrix HepB should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nTRITANRIX HepB SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE ADMINISTERED \nINTRAVENOUSLY. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered when \nadministering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and \nparticularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \n \nAs the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIt is current practice in paediatric vaccination to co-administer different vaccines during the same session \nwith injectable vaccines being administered at separate injection sites. \n \nTritanrix HepB can be administered simultaneously at separate sites or in any temporal relationship with \nother paediatric vaccines if this fits conveniently in the immunisation scheme. \n \nIn clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB has been administered simultaneously with oral polio vaccine (OPV) and \nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. In these studies the immune response to the oral polio vaccine \nhas not been investigated, however, previous experience with simultaneous administration of DTP, OPV and \nHBV vaccines has not shown any interference. In some clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB was used to \nreconstitute the lyophilised Hib vaccine (Hiberix); no interference in the immune response to any of the \nantigens was observed as compared to the responses observed following administration of the vaccines at \nseparate sites (see section 6.2). \n \nIn patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response \nmay not be achieved. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs Tritanrix HepB is not intended for use in adults, information on the safety of the vaccine when used \nduring pregnancy or lactation is not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n• Clinical trials: \n \n\nIn clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse events were reactions at the injection site, \nincluding redness, swelling and pain. \n \nGeneral reactions that may occur in temporal association with Tritanrix HepB vaccination are listed \nbelow. \n \nFrequencies are defined as follows: \nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n5 \n\nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \nNervous system disorders: \nvery common: drowsiness \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \ncommon: bronchitis  \nuncommon: respiratory disorder \n \nGastro-intestinal disorders: \nvery common: feeding problems \ncommon: gastro-intestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea \n \nInfections and infestations: \ncommon: otitis media, pharyngitis \nuncommon: pneumonia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nvery common: fever, swelling, pain and redness \n \nImmune system disorders: \nvery rare: allergic reactions including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions and serum sickness \nlike disease \n \nPsychiatric disorders: \nvery common: unusual crying, irritability \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n6 \n\nIn a prospective comparative study, which compared the administration of the combined DTPw-HBV \nvaccine with the simultaneous separate administration of DTPw and HBV vaccine, higher incidences of pain, \nredness, swelling and fever were reported in the group receiving the combined vaccine.

The Pw component is obtained by \nheat inactivation of phase I culture of Bordetella pertussis bacteria. \n \nThe surface antigen of the HBV (HBsAg) is produced by culture of genetically-engineered yeast cells \n(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) which carry the gene coding for the major surface antigen of the HBV.  This \nHBsAg expressed in yeast cells is purified by several physico-chemical steps.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nDiphtheria toxoid1 not less than 30 IU \nTetanus toxoid1 not less than 60 IU \nBordetella pertussis (inactivated)2 not less than 4 IU \nHepatitis B surface antigen2,3 10 micrograms \n \n1 Adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide, hydrated 0.26 milligrams Al3+ \n2 Adsorbed on aluminium phosphate 0.37 milligrams Al3+ \n3 Produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA technology \n \nThis is a multidose container. See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nTurbid white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTritanrix HepB is indicated for active immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis \nB (HBV) in infants from 6 weeks onwards (see section 4.2). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.5 ml. \n \nPrimary vaccination: \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses within the first six months of life.  Where HBV \nvaccine is not given at birth, the combined vaccine can be administered beginning as early as 8 weeks of \nage.  Where there is a high endemicity of HBV, the practice to administer HBV vaccine at birth should \nbe continued.  In these circumstances, vaccination with the combined vaccine should start at 6 weeks of \nage. \n \nThree vaccine doses must be administered at intervals of at least 4 weeks. \n \nWhen Tritanrix HepB is given according to the 6-10-14 weeks schedule, it is recommended to \nadminister a dose of HBV vaccine at birth to improve protection. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n11 \n\nIn the case of children born of known HBV carrier mothers the immunoprophylactic measures for \nhepatitis B should not be modified.  This may require separate vaccination with HBV and DTPw \nvaccines and also include the administration of HBIg at birth.  \n \nBooster vaccination: \n \nA booster dose with Tritanrix HepB will give rise to increased reactogenicity as would be expected for a \nbooster during the second year of life. In consequence, boostering should follow local recommendations.  \n \nThe administration of a booster dose with trivalent DTP vaccine is recommended before the end of the \nsecond year of life. For long-term protection against HBV, a booster dose of HBV vaccine could also be \nadministered after the first year of life. However, the need for this dose is currently not established. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTritanrix HepB is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. \n \nIt is recommended that in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders the vaccine be administered \nsubcutaneously (see section 4.4.). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or hepatitis B vaccines. \n \nThe administration of Tritanrix HepB should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe \nfebrile illness. \n \nTritanrix HepB is contraindicated if the child has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, \noccurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine.  In these \ncircumstances the vaccination course should be continued with DT and HBV vaccines. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous \nvaccination and possible occurrence of adverse reactions) and a clinical examination. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case \nof anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.  For this reason, the vaccinee \nshould remain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after vaccination. \n \nIf any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of Tritanrix HepB, the decision to give \nsubsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered. \n\nTemperature of ≥ 40.0 C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. \nCollapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. \nPersistent crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. \nConvulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. \n\nThere may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh \npossible risks.  \n \nAs for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Tritanrix HepB or deferring this vaccination \nshould be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or progression of a severe \nneurological disorder. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n12 \n\nA history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions, a family history of SIDS (Sudden Infant \nDeath Syndrome) and a family history of an adverse reaction following Tritanrix HepB vaccination do \nnot constitute contra-indications. \n \nHIV infection is not considered as a contra-indication for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and HBV vaccination. \nThe expected immunological response may not be obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients, \ne.g. patients on immunosuppressive therapy. \n \nTritanrix HepB should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nTRITANRIX HepB SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE ADMINISTERED \nINTRAVENOUSLY. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered when \nadministering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and \nparticularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \n \nAs the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or \ndelayed. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIt is current practice in paediatric vaccination to co-administer different vaccines during the same \nsession with injectable vaccines being administered at separate injection sites. \n \nTritanrix HepB can be administered simultaneously at separate sites or in any temporal relationship with \nother paediatric vaccines if this fits conveniently in the immunisation scheme. \n \nIn clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB has been administered simultaneously with oral polio vaccine (OPV) \nand Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. In these studies the immune response to the oral polio \nvaccine has not been investigated, however, previous experience with simultaneous administration of \nDTP, OPV and HBV vaccines has not shown any interference.  In some clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB \nwas used to reconstitute the lyophilised Hib vaccine (Hiberix); no interference in the immune response \nto any of the antigens was observed as compared to the responses observed following administration of \nthe vaccines at separate sites. (see section 6.2.). \n \nIn patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate \nresponse may not be achieved. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs Tritanrix HepB is not intended for use in adults, information on the safety of the vaccine when used \nduring pregnancy or lactation is not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n• Clinical trials: \n \n\nIn clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse events were reactions at the injection site, \nincluding redness, swelling and pain. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n13 \n\nGeneral reactions that may occur in temporal association with Tritanrix HepB vaccination  are listed \nbelow. \n\n \n Frequencies are defined as follows: \n\nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nNervous system disorders: \nvery common: drowsiness \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \ncommon: bronchitis  \nuncommon: respiratory disorder \n \nGastro-intestinal disorders: \nvery common: feeding problems \ncommon: gastro-intestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea \n \nInfections and infestations: \ncommon: otitis media, pharyngitis \nuncommon: pneumonia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nvery common: fever, swelling, pain and redness \n \nImmune system disorders: \nvery rare: allergic reactions including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions and serum sickness \nlike disease \n \nPsychiatric disorders: \nvery common: unusual crying, irritability \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n14 \n\nIn a prospective comparative study, which compared the administration of the combined DTPw-HBV \nvaccine with the simultaneous separate administration of DTPw and HBV vaccine, higher incidences of pain, \nredness, swelling and fever were reported in the group receiving the combined vaccine.

Further information \n \n \n1.   WHAT TRITANRIX HepB IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nTritanrix HepB is a vaccine used in children to prevent four diseases: diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis \n(whooping cough) and hepatitis B. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection \n(antibodies) against these diseases. \n \n• Diphtheria: Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin.  Generally the airways \n\nbecome inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation.  The bacteria \nalso release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. \n\n \n• Tetanus (Lockjaw): Tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin.  \n\nWounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated \nwith soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters.  The bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can \ncause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.  The muscle spasms can be strong \nenough to cause bone fractures of the spine. \n\n \n• Pertussis (Whooping cough): Pertussis is a highly infectious illness.  The disease affects the airways \n\ncausing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing.  The coughing is often \naccompanied by a “whooping” sound, hence the common name “whooping cough”.  The cough may last \nfor 1-2 months or longer.  Pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which may last a long time, \npneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death.   \n\n \n• Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.  It causes the liver to become inflamed and \n\nswollen .  The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of \ninfected people. \n\n \nVaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. None of the components in the vaccine are \ninfectious.  \n \n \n2.  BEFORE YOUR CHILD RECEIVES TRITANRIX HepB \n \nTritanrix HepB should not be given: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n33 \n\n• if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to Tritanrix HepB, or any ingredient contained in \nthis vaccine.  The active substances and other ingredients in Tritanrix HepB are listed at the end of the \nleaflet.  Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of \nthe face or tongue. \n\n• if your child has previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis (whooping cough) or hepatitis B diseases. \n\n• if your child experienced problems of the nervous system within 7 days after previous vaccination \nwith a vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) disease. \n\n• if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  A minor infection such as a \ncold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. \n\n \nTake special care with Tritanrix HepB: \n \n• if your child has experienced any health problems after previous administration of a vaccine. \n• if after previously having Tritanrix HepB or another vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) \n\ndisease, your child had any problems, especially:  \n♦ A high temperature (over 40°C) within 48 hours of vaccination \n♦ A collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination \n♦ Persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination \n♦ Seizures/fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination \n\n• if your child is suffering from an undiagnosed or progressive disease of the brain or uncontrolled \nepilepsy. After control of the disease the vaccine should be administered \n\n• if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily \n• if your child has a tendency to seizures/fits due to a fever, or if there is a history in the family of this \n \nUsing other medicines or vaccines \nPlease tell your doctor if your child is taking or has recently taken any other medicines, including medicines \nobtained without a prescription or has recently received any other vaccine. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Tritanrix HepB \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that your child may \nexperience an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor if your child has any known allergies. \n \n \n3. HOW TRITANRIX HepB IS GIVEN \n \nYour child will receive a total of three injections with an interval of at least one month between each one. \nEach injection is given on a separate visit. You will be informed by the doctor or nurse when you should \ncome back for subsequent injections. \n \nIf additional injections are necessary, the doctor will tell you. \n \nIf your child misses a scheduled injection, talk to your doctor and arrange another visit. \n \nMake sure your child finishes the complete vaccination course of three injections.  If not, your child may not \nbe fully protected against the diseases. \n \nThe doctor will give Tritanrix HepB as an injection into the thigh muscle. Your child will remain under \nmedical supervision for 30 minutes after each injection. \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a vein. \n \n \n4.  POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Tritanrix HepB can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n34 \n\n \nSide effects that occurred during clinical trials with Tritanrix HepB were as follows: \n \n♦ Very common (side effects which may occur in more than 1 per 10 doses of vaccine):  \n\n• pain or discomfort at the injection site \n• redness or swelling at the injection site \n• fever (more than 38°C) \n• drowsiness, irritability, unusual crying \n• feeding problems \n\n \n♦ Common (side effects which may occur in less than 1 per 10 but more than 1 per 100 doses of \n\nvaccine):  \n• infection of the middle ear \n• bronchitis \n• sore throat and discomfort when swallowing \n• gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea \n \n\n♦ Uncommon (side effects which may occur in less than 1 per 100 but more than 1 per 1,000 doses of \nvaccine):  \n• pneumonia (serious lung infection) \n• respiratory disorder \n\n \n♦ Very rare (side effects which may occur in less than 10,000 doses of vaccine):  \n\n• allergic reactions, including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions. These may be local or \nwidespread rashes that may be itchy or blistering, swelling of the eyes and face, difficulty in \nbreathing or swallowing, a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Such reactions \nmay occur before leaving the doctor’s surgery.  However, you should seek immediate treatment in \nany event.  \n\n• serum sickness like disease (a hypersensitivity reaction to the administration of a foreign serum \nwith symptoms like fever, swelling, skin rash, enlargement of the lymph nodes) \n\n \nAfter the marketing of Tritanrix HepB, the following additional side effects have been reported on a few \noccasions: \n \n\n• collapse or periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness have been reported within 2 to 3 days \nafter vaccination \n\n• in babies born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation) longer gaps than normal \nbetween breaths may occur for 2-3 days after vaccination \n\n \nTritanrix HepB contains a hepatitis B component, to provide protection against disease caused by hepatitis B \nvirus.  The following undesirable events have occurred very rarely following the administration of hepatitis \nB containing vaccines: \n♦ seizures or fits \n♦ bleeding or bruising more easily than normal \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5.  HOW TO STORE TRITANRIX HepB \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use Tritanrix HepB after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. The expiry date refers to the \nlast day of that month. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n35 \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C) \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light.   \nDo not freeze.  Freezing destroys the vaccine. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required.  These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.
