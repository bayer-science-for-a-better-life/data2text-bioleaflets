NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCimzia 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 200 mg certolizumab pegol in one ml. \n \nCertolizumab pegol is a recombinant, humanised antibody Fab' fragment against tumour necrosis \nfactor alpha (TNF\u03b1) expressed in Escherichia coli and conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nClear to opalescent, colourless to yellow solution. The pH of the solution is approximately 4.7. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nCimzia, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for: \n\uf0b7 the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including MTX, has been \ninadequate. Cimzia can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when \ncontinued treatment with MTX is inappropriate \n\n \n\uf0b7 the treatment of severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or \n\nother DMARDs. \n \nCimzia has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by  \nX-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with MTX. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nCimzia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe active axial spondyloarthritis, \ncomprising:  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) (also known as radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \nAdults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to, or are \nintolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n\n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS (also known as non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis) \nAdults with severe active axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS but with \nobjective signs of inflammation by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and /or magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI), who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to NSAIDs. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \nCimzia, in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults \nwhen the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nCimzia can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy. \n \nFor details on therapeutic effects, see section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of conditions for which Cimzia is indicated. Patients should be given the special reminder \ncard. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis \n \nLoading dose  \nThe recommended starting dose of Cimzia for adult patients is 400 mg (given \nas 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) at weeks 0, 2 and 4. For rheumatoid arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis, MTX should be continued during treatment with Cimzia where appropriate. \n \nMaintenance dose \nRheumatoid arthritis \nAfter the starting dose, the recommended maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis is 200 mg every 2 weeks. Once clinical response is confirmed, an alternative \nmaintenance dosing of 400 mg every 4 weeks can be considered. MTX should be continued during \ntreatment with Cimzia where appropriate. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nAfter the starting dose, the recommended maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with axial \nspondyloarthritis is 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks. After at least 1 year of treatment \nwith Cimzia, in patients with sustained remission, a reduced maintenance dose of 200 mg every 4 \nweeks may be considered (see section 5.1). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nAfter the starting dose, the recommended maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with psoriatic \narthritis is 200 mg every 2 weeks. Once clinical response is confirmed, an alternative maintenance \ndosing of 400 mg every 4 weeks can be considered. MTX should be continued during treatment with \nCimzia where appropriate. \n \nFor the above indications, available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who \nshow no evidence of therapeutic benefit within the first 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nAfter the starting dose, the maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with plaque psoriasis \nis 200 mg every 2 weeks. A dose of 400 mg every 2 weeks can be considered in patients with \ninsufficient response (see section 5.1).  \nAvailable data in adults with plaque psoriasis suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 16 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who \nshow no evidence of therapeutic benefit within the first 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with an \ninitial partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nMissed dose \nPatients who miss a dose should be advised to inject the next dose of Cimzia as soon as they \nremember and then continue injecting subsequent doses as instructed. \n \nSpecial populations \nPaediatric population (< 18 years old) \nThe safety and efficacy of Cimzia in children and adolescents below age 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) \nNo dose adjustment is required. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed no effect of age (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nCimzia has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nThe total content (1 ml) of the pre-filled syringe should be administered as a subcutaneous injection \nonly. Suitable sites for injection would include the thigh or abdomen. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject using the pre-filled syringe if their \nphysician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. The pre-filled \nsyringe with needle guard should only be used by healthcare professionals. The physician should \ndiscuss with the patient which injection presentation option is the most appropriate. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis or opportunistic infections (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA classes III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \nPatients must be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of infections including tuberculosis before, \nduring and after treatment with Cimzia. Because the elimination of certolizumab pegol may take up \nto 5 months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period (see section 4.3). \n \nTreatment with Cimzia must not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection, \nincluding chronic or localised infections, until the infection is controlled (see section 4.3).  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Cimzia should be monitored \nclosely. Administration of Cimzia should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection \nuntil the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of \nCimzia in patients with a history of recurring or opportunistic infection or with underlying conditions \nwhich may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive \nmedications. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPatients with rheumatoid arthritis may not manifest typical symptoms of infection, including fever, \ndue to their disease and concomitant medicinal products. Therefore, early detection of any infection, \nparticularly atypical clinical presentations of a serious infection, is critical to minimise delays in \ndiagnosis and initiation of treatment. \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis and tuberculosis (including miliary, disseminated and \nextrapulmonary disease), and opportunistic infections (e.g. histoplasmosis, nocardia, candidiasis) have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Cimzia. Some of these events have been fatal. \n \nTuberculosis \nBefore initiation of therapy with Cimzia, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(latent) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history for patients \nwith a personal history of tuberculosis, with possible previous exposure to others with active \ntuberculosis, and with previous and/or current use of immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate \nscreening tests, e.g. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local \nrecommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in \nthe patient's reminder card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test \nresults, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed prior to or during treatment, Cimzia therapy must not be initiated \nand must be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n \nIf inactive (\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of \ntuberculosis should be consulted. In all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of Cimzia \ntherapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy must be started before \ninitiating treatment with Cimzia and in accordance with local recommendations.  \nUse of anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered before the initiation of Cimzia in patients \nwith a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be \nconfirmed, and in patients who have significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \nlatent tuberculosis. Biological tests for tuberculosis screening should be considered before starting \nCimzia treatment if there is any potential latent tuberculosis infection, regardless of BCG vaccination. \n \nDespite previous or concomitant prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of active tuberculosis \nhave occurred in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including Cimzia. Some patients who have \nbeen successfully treated for active tuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated \nwith Cimzia. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g. persistent cough, \nwasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during \nor after therapy with Cimzia. \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including certolizumab \npegol, who are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e., surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a \nfatal outcome.  \n \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Cimzia. For patients who \ntest positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended.  \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Cimzia should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \n\n\n\n6 \n\nwho develop HBV reactivation, Cimzia should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nThe potential role of TNF-antagonist therapy in the development of malignancies is not known. \nCaution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of \nmalignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop malignancy.  \n \nWith the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other \nmalignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n \nIn clinical trials with Cimzia and other TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma and other \nmalignancies have been reported among patients receiving TNF-antagonists than in control patients \nreceiving placebo (see section 4.8). In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. \n \nNo trials have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy, or that continue \ntreatment in patients who develop malignancy, while receiving Cimzia.  \n \nSkin cancers \nMelanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists \nincluding certolizumab pegol (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended, \nparticularly for patients with risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nPaediatric malignancy \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up \nto 22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age) in the post \nmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a \nvariety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated \nwith TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), have been reported in patients \ntreated with TNF-antagonists. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course \nand is usually fatal. The majority of reported TNF-antagonist cases occurred in adolescent and young \nadult males with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. Almost all of these patients had received \ntreatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine and/or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a \nTNF-antagonist at or prior to diagnosis. A risk for development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in \npatients treated with Cimzia cannot be excluded. \n \nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \nCongestive heart failure \nCimzia is contraindicated in moderate or severe heart failure (see section 4.3). In a clinical trial with \nanother TNF-antagonist, worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality due to congestive \nheart failure have been observed. Cases of congestive heart failure have also been reported in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients receiving Cimzia. Cimzia should be used with caution in patients with \nmild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Treatment with Cimzia must be discontinued in patients who \ndevelop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nHaematological reactions \nReports of pancytopaenia, including aplastic anaemia, have been rare with TNF-antagonists. Adverse \nreactions of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopaenia (e.g. leukopaenia, \npancytopaenia, thrombocytopaenia) have been reported with Cimzia (see section 4.8). All patients \nshould be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive \nof blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Cimzia. \nDiscontinuation of Cimzia therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant \nhaematological abnormalities. \n \nNeurological events \nUse of TNF-antagonists has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical \nsymptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis. In \npatients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disorders, the benefits and risks of \nTNF-antagonist treatment should be carefully considered before initiation of Cimzia therapy. Rare \ncases of neurological disorders, including seizure disorder, neuritis and peripheral neuropathy, have \nbeen reported in patients treated with Cimzia. \n \nHypersensitivity \nSevere hypersensitivity reactions have been reported rarely following Cimzia administration. Some of \nthese reactions occurred after the first administration of Cimzia. If severe reactions occur, \nadministration of Cimzia should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted.  \n \nThere are limited data on the use of Cimzia in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity \nreaction towards another TNF-antagonist; in these patients caution is needed. \n \nLatex-sensitivity  \nThe needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of \nnatural rubber latex (see section 6.5). Contact with natural rubber latex may cause severe allergic \nreactions in individuals sensitive to latex. No antigenic latex protein has to date been detected in the \nremovable needle cap of the Cimzia pre-filled syringe. Nevertheless, a potential risk of \nhypersensitivity reactions cannot be completely excluded in latex-sensitive individuals. \n \nImmunosuppression \nSince tumour necrosis factor (TNF) mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses, \nthe possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including Cimzia, to cause immunosupression, affecting \nhost defences against infections and malignancies. \n \nAutoimmunity \nTreatment with Cimzia may result in the formation of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and, \nuncommonly, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome (see section 4.8). The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Cimzia on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Cimzia, treatment must be \ndiscontinued. Cimzia has not been studied specifically in a lupus population (see section 4.8). \n \nVaccinations \nPatients treated with Cimzia may receive vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available \non the response to live vaccinations or the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in \npatients receiving Cimzia. Live vaccines should not be administered concurrently with Cimzia. \n \nIn a placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, similar antibody response \nbetween Cimzia and placebo treatment were observed when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine \nand influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with Cimzia. Patients receiving Cimzia and \nconcomitant methotrexate had a lower humoral response compared with patients receiving Cimzia \nalone. The clinical significance of this is unknown.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nConcomitant use with other biologics \nSevere infections and neutropaenia were reported in clinical trials with concurrent use of anakinra (an \ninterleukin-1 antagonist) or abatacept (a CD28 modulator) and another TNF-antagonist, etanercept, \nwith no added benefit compared to TNF-antagonist therapy alone. Because of the nature of the adverse \nevents seen with the combination of another TNF-antagonist with either abatacept or anakinra therapy, \nsimilar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra or abatacept and other \nTNF-antagonists. Therefore the use of certolizumab pegol in combination with anakinra or abatacept \nis not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \nThere is limited safety experience with surgical procedures in patients treated with Cimzia. The 14-day \nhalf-life of certolizumab pegol should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \npatient who requires surgery while on Cimzia should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. \n \nActivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay \nInterference with certain coagulation assays has been detected in patients treated with Cimzia. Cimzia \nmay cause erroneously elevated aPTT assay results in patients without coagulation abnormalities. This \neffect has been observed with the PTT-Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) test and Standard Target Activated \nPartial Thromboplastin time (STA-PTT) Automate tests from Diagnostica Stago, and the HemosIL \nAPTT-SP liquid and HemosIL lyophilised silica tests from Instrumentation Laboratories. Other aPTT \nassays may be affected as well. There is no evidence that Cimzia therapy has an effect on coagulation \nin vivo. After patients receive Cimzia, careful attention should be given to interpretation of abnormal \ncoagulation results. Interference with thrombin time (TT) and prothrombin time (PT) assays have not \nbeen observed. \n \nElderly patients \nIn the clinical trials, there was an apparently higher incidence of infections among subjects \u2265 65 years \nof age, compared to younger subjects, although experience is limited. Caution should be exercised \nwhen treating the elderly patients, and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of \ninfections. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant treatment with methotrexate, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs) and analgesics showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetics analysis. \n \nThe combination of certolizumab pegol and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of Cimzia with methotrexate had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nmethotrexate. In study-to-study comparison, the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol appeared \nsimilar to those observed previously in healthy subjects. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \nThe use of adequate contraception should be considered for women of childbearing potential. For \nwomen planning pregnancy, continued contraception may be considered for 5 months after the last \nCimzia dose due to its elimination rate (see section 5.2), but the need for treatment of the woman \nshould also be taken into account (see below). \n \nPregnancy \nData from more than 500 prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to Cimzia with known \npregnancy outcomes, including more than 400 pregnancies exposed during the first trimester, does not \nindicate a malformative effect of Cimzia. However, the available clinical experience is too limited to, \n\n\n\n9 \n\nwith a reasonable certainty, conclude that there is no increased risk associated with Cimzia \nadministration during pregnancy. \n \nAnimal studies using a rodent anti-rat TNF\u03b1 did not reveal evidence of impaired fertility or harm to \nthe foetus. However, these are insufficient with respect to human reproductive toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). Due to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, Cimzia administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune response in the newborn.  \n \nCimzia should only be used during pregnancy if clinically needed. \n \nNon-clinical studies suggest low or negligible level of placental transfer of a homologue Fab-fragment \nof certolizumab pegol (no Fc region) (see section 5.3).  \n \nIn a clinical study 16 women were treated with certolizumab pegol (200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg \nevery 4 weeks) during pregnancy. Certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations measured in 14 infants at \nbirth were Below the Limit of Quantification (BLQ) in 13 samples; one was 0.042 \u00b5g/ml with an \ninfant/mother plasma ratio at birth of 0.09%. At Week 4 and Week 8, all infant concentrations were \nBLQ. The clinical significance of low levels certolizumab pegol for infants is unknown. It is \nrecommended to wait a minimum of 5 months following the mother\u2019s last Cimzia administration \nduring pregnancy before administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine), unless \nthe benefit of the vaccination clearly outweighs the theoretical risk of administration of live or live-\nattenuated vaccines to the infants. \n \nBreastfeeding \nIn a clinical study in 17 lactating women treated with Cimzia, minimal transfer of certolizumab pegol \nfrom plasma to breast milk was observed. The percentage of the maternal certolizumab pegol dose \nreaching an infant during a 24 hour period was estimated to 0.04% to 0.30 %. In addition, since \ncertolizumab pegol is a protein that is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, \nthe absolute bioavailability is expected to be very low in a breastfed infant. \n \nConsequently, Cimzia can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nEffects on sperm motility measures and a trend of reduced sperm count in male rodents have been \nobserved with no apparent effect on fertility (see section 5.3).  \n \nIn a clinical trial to assess the effect of certolizumab pegol on semen quality parameters, 20 healthy \nmale subjects were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of 400 mg of certolizumab pegol \nor placebo. During the 14-week follow-up, no treatment effects of certolizumab pegol were seen on \nsemen quality parameters compared to placebo. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCimzia may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness (including \nvertigo, vision disorder and fatigue) may occur following administration of Cimzia (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nCimzia was studied in 4,049 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in controlled and open label trials for \nup to 92 months. \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies, patients receiving Cimzia had an approximately 4 times greater \nduration of exposure compared with the placebo group. This difference in exposure is primarily due to \n\n\n\n10 \n\npatients on placebo being more likely to withdraw early. In addition, Studies RA-I and RA-II had a \nmandatory withdrawal for non-responders at Week 16, the majority of whom were on placebo. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the controlled \ntrials was 4.4% for patients treated with Cimzia and 2.7% for patients treated with placebo. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions belonged to the system organ classes Infections and infestations, \nreported in 14.4% of patients on Cimzia and 8.0% of patients on placebo, General disorders and \nadministration site conditions, reported in 8.8% of patients on Cimzia and 7.4% of patients on placebo, \nand Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, reported in 7.0% of patients on Cimzia and 2.4% of \npatients on placebo. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nCimzia was initially studied in 325 patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing \nspondylitis and non-radiopraphic axial spondyloarthritis) in the AS001 clinical study for up to 4 years, \nwhich includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and \na 156-week open-label treatment period. Cimzia was subsequently studied in 317 patients with non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis in a placebo-controlled study for 52 weeks (AS0006). Cimzia was \nalso studied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in a clinical study for up to 96 weeks, which included a 48-week \nopen-label run-in phase (N=736) followed by a 48-week placebo-controlled phase (N=313) for \npatients in sustained remission (C-OPTIMISE). In all 3 studies, the safety profile for these patients \nwas consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous experience with Cimzia. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \nCimzia was studied in 409 patients with psoriatic arthritis in the PsA001 clinical study for up \nto 4 years which includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind \nperiod and a 168-week open-label treatment period. The safety profile for psoriatic arthritis patients \ntreated with Cimzia was consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous \nexperience with Cimzia. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia was studied in 1112 patients with psoriasis in controlled and open-label studies for up to 3 \nyears. In the Phase III program, the initial and maintenance periods were followed by a 96-week open-\nlabel treatment period (see section 5.1). The long-term safety profile of Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks \nand Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks was generally similar and consistent with previous experience with \nCimzia. \n \nDuring controlled clinical trials through Week 16, the proportion of patients with serious adverse \nevents was 3.5% for Cimzia and 3.7% for placebo.  \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events in the controlled clinical \nstudies was 1.5% for patients treated with Cimzia and 1.4% for patients treated with placebo.  \n \nThe most common adverse reactions reported through Week 16 belonged to the system organ classes \nInfections and infestations, reported in 6.1% of patients on Cimzia and 7% of patients on placebo, \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions, reported in 4.1% of patients on Cimzia and 2.3% \nof patients on placebo, and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, reported in 3.5% of patients on \nCimzia and 2.8% of patients on placebo. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions based primarily on experience from the placebo-controlled clinical trials and \npostmarketing cases at least possibly related to Cimzia are listed in Table 1 below, according to \nfrequency and system organ class. Frequency categories are defined as follows: Very common \n(\u2265 1/10); Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100); Rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1000); Very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\n\n\n11 \n\ndata). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions in clinical trials and postmarketing \n\nSystem Organ Class

following adverse reactions have been observed uncommonly with Cimzia in other \nindications: gastrointestinal stenosis and obstructions, general physical health deterioration, abortion \nspontaneous and azoospermia. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections \nThe incidence rate of new cases of infections in placebo-controlled clinical trials in rheumatoid \narthritis was 1.03 per patient-year for all Cimzia-treated patients and 0.92 per patient-year for placebo-\ntreated patients. The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract \ninfections, and lower respiratory tract infections and herpes viral infections (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nIn the placebo-controlled clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis, there were more new cases of serious \ninfection in the Cimzia treatment groups (0.07 per patient-year; all doses), compared with placebo \n(0.02 per patient-year). The most frequent serious infections included pneumonia, tuberculosis \ninfections. Serious infections also included invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. pneumocystosis, \nfungal oesophagitis, nocardiosis and herpes zoster disseminated). There is no evidence of an increased \nrisk of infections with continued exposure over time (see section 4.4). \n \nThe incidence rate of new cases of infections in placebo-controlled clinical trials in psoriasis \nwas 1.37 per patient-year for all Cimzia-treated patients and 1.59 per patient-year for placebo-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections and viral infections \n(including herpes infections). The incidence of serious infections was 0.02 per patient-year in Cimzia \ntreated patients. No serious infections were reported in the placebo-treated patients. There is no \nevidence of an increased risk of infections with continued exposure over time. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nExcluding non-melanoma of the skin, 121 malignancies including 5 cases of lymphoma were observed \nin the Cimzia RA clinical trials in which a total of 4,049 patients were treated, \nrepresenting 9,277 patient-years. Cases of lymphoma occurred at an incidence rate \nof 0.05 per 100 patient-years and melanoma at an incidence rate of 0.08 per 100 patient-years with \nCimzia in rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials (see section 4.4). One case of lymphoma was also \nobserved in the Phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical trial. \n \nExcluding non-melanoma skin cancer, 11 malignancies including 1 case of lymphoma were observed \nin the Cimzia psoriasis clinical trials in which a total of 1112 patients were treated, representing 2300 \npatient-years. \n \nAutoimmunity \nIn the rheumatoid arthritis pivotal studies, for subjects who were ANA negative at baseline, 16.7% of \nthose treated with Cimzia developed positive ANA titers, compared with 12.0% of subjects in the \nplacebo group. For subjects who were anti-dsDNA antibody negative at baseline, 2.2% of those treated \nwith Cimzia developed positive anti-dsDNA antibody titers, compared with 1.0% of subjects in the \nplacebo group. In both placebo-controlled and open-label follow-up clinical trials for rheumatoid \narthritis, cases of lupus-like syndrome were reported uncommonly. There have been rare reports of \nother immune-mediated conditions; the causal relationship to Cimzia is not known. The impact of \nlong-term treatment with Cimzia on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. \n \nInjection site reactions \nIn the placebo-controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials, 5.8% of patients treated with Cimzia \ndeveloped injection site reactions such as erythema, itching, haematoma, pain, swelling or bruising, \ncompared to 4.8% of patients receiving placebo. Injection site pain was observed in 1.5% of patients \ntreated with Cimzia with no cases leading to withdrawal. \n \nCreatine phosphokinase elevations \nThe frequency of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations was generally higher in patients with \naxSpA as compared to the RA population. The frequency was increased both in patients treated with \nplacebo (2.8% vs 0.4% in axSpA and RA populations, respectively) as well as in patients treated with \nCimzia (4.7% vs 0.8% in axSpA and RA populations, respectively). The CPK elevations in the axSpA \n\n\n\n14 \n\nstudy were mostly mild to moderate, transient in nature and of unknown clinical significance with no \ncases leading to withdrawal. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. Multiple doses of up to 800 mg \nsubcutaneously and 20 mg/kg intravenously have been administered. In cases of overdose, it is \nrecommended that patients are monitored closely for any adverse reactions or effect, and appropriate \nsymptomatic treatment initiated immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nCimzia has a high affinity for human TNF\u03b1 and binds with a dissociation constant (KD) of 90 pM. \nTNF\u03b1 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine with a central role in inflammatory processes. Cimzia \nselectively neutralises TNF\u03b1 (IC90 of 4 ng/ml for inhibition of human TNF\u03b1 in the in vitro \nL929 murine fibrosarcoma cytotoxicity assay) but does not neutralise lymphotoxin \u03b1 (TNF\u03b2).  \n \nCimzia was shown to neutralise membrane associated and soluble human TNF\u03b1 in a dose-dependent \nmanner. Incubation of monocytes with Cimzia resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 production in human monocytes. \n \nCimzia does not contain a fragment crystallisable (Fc) region, which is normally present in a complete \nantibody, and therefore does not fix complement or cause antibody-dependent cell-mediated \ncytotoxicity in vitro. It does not induce apoptosis in vitro in human peripheral blood-derived \nmonocytes or lymphocytes, or neutrophil degranulation. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia have been assessed in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-\nblind clinical trials in patients \u2265 18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according \nto American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, RA-I (RAPID 1) and RA-II (RAPID 2). \nPatients had \u2265 9 swollen and tender joints each and had active RA for at least 6 months prior to \nbaseline. Cimzia was administered subcutaneously in combination with oral MTX for a minimum \nof 6 months with stable doses of at least 10 mg weekly for 2 months in both trials. There is no \nexperience with Cimzia in combination with DMARDs other than MTX. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia was assessed in DMARD-na\u00efve adult patients with active RA in a \nrandomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial (C-EARLY). In the C-EARLY trial patients \nwere \u2265 18 years of age and had \u2265 4 swollen and tender joints each and must have been diagnosed with \nmoderate to severe active and progressive RA within 1 year (as defined by the 2010 ACR/European \nLeague Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria). Patients had a mean time since \ndiagnosis at baseline of 2.9 months and were DMARD na\u00efve (including MTX). For both the Cimzia \n\n\n\n15 \n\nand placebo arms, MTX was initiated as of Week 0 (10 mg/week), titrated up to maximum tolerated \ndose by Week 8 (min 15 mg/week, max 25 mg/week allowed), and maintained throughout the study \n(average dose of MTX after Week 8 for placebo and Cimzia was 22.3 mg/week and 21.1 mg/week \nrespectively). \n \nTable 2 Clinical trial description \n\nStudy \nnumber \n\nPatient \nnumbers \n\nActive dose regimen Study objectives \n \n\nRA-I \n(52 weeks) \n\n982 400 mg (0,2,4 weeks) \nwith MTX \n\n200 mg or 400 mg \nevery 2 weeks with MTX \n\nEvaluation for treatment of signs and \nsymptoms and inhibition of structural damage.  \nCo-primary endpoints: ACR 20 at Week 24 and \n\nchange from baseline in mTSS at Week 52 \nRA-II \n\n(24 weeks) \n619 400 mg (0,2,4 weeks) \n\nwith MTX \n200 mg or 400 mg \nevery 2 weeks with \n\nMTX \n\nEvaluation for treatment of signs and \nsymptoms and inhibition of structural damage. \n\nPrimary endpoint: ACR 20 at Week 24.  \n\nC-EARLY \n(to 52 wee\n\nks) \n\n879 400 mg (0,2,4 weeks) \nwith MTX \n\n200 mg every 2 weeks \nwith MTX \n\nEvaluation for treatment of signs and \nsymptoms and inhibition of structural damage \n\nin DMARD na\u00efve patients.  \nPrimary endpoint: proportion of subjects in \n\nsustained remission* at Week 52 \nmTSS: modified Total Sharp Score \n*Sustained remission at Week 52 is defined as DAS28[ESR] <2.6 at both Week 40 and Week 52. \n \nSigns and symptoms \nThe results of clinical trials RA-I and RA-II are shown in Table 3. Statistically significantly greater \nACR 20 and ACR 50 responses were achieved from Week 1 and Week 2, respectively, in both clinical \ntrials compared to placebo. Responses were maintained through Weeks 52 (RA-I) and 24 (RA-II). Of \nthe 783 patients initially randomised to active treatment in RA-I, 508 completed 52 weeks of placebo-\ncontrolled treatment and entered the open-label extension study. Of these, 427 completed 2 years of \nopen-label follow-up and thus had a total exposure to Cimzia of 148 weeks overall. The observed \nACR 20 response rate at this timepoint was 91%.The reduction (RA-I) from Baseline in DAS28 (ESR) \nalso was significantly greater (p<0.001) at Week 52 (RA-I) and Week 24 (RA-II) compared to placebo \nand maintained through 2 years in the open-label extension trial to RA-I. \n \nTable 3 ACR response in clinical trials RA-I and RA-II \n\n Study RA-I \nMethotrexate combination \n\n(24 and 52 weeks) \n\nStudy RA-II \nMethotrexate combination \n\n(24 weeks) \nResponse Placebo + MTX \n\n \nN=199 \n\nCimzia  \n200 mg + MTX \nevery 2 weeks \n\n \nN=393 \n\nPlacebo + MTX \n \n\nN=127 \n\nCimzia  \n200 mg + MTX \nevery 2 weeks \n\n \nN=246 \n\nACR 20     \nWeek 24 14% 59%** 9% 57%** \nWeek 52 13% 53%** N/A N/A \nACR 50     \nWeek 24 8% 37%** 3% 33%** \nWeek 52 8% 38%** N/A N/A \n\n\n\n16 \n\nACR 70     \nWeek 24 3% 21%** 1% 16%* \nWeek 52 4% 21%** N/A N/A \nMajor \nClinical \nResponsea. \n\n1% 13%**   \n\nCimzia vs. placebo: *p\u22640.01, ** p<0.001 \na.

Assessments on remission (DAS28(ESR) <2.6), Low Disease \nActivity (DAS28(ESR) \u22643.2) status, ACR50 and ACR 70 by visit demonstrated that Cimzia+MTX \ntreatment led to faster and greater responses than PBO+MTX treatment. These results were maintained \nover 52 weeks of treatment in DMARD-na\u00efve subjects.  \n \nRadiographic response \nIn RA-I, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in mTSS and \nits components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing (JSN) score, at Week 52, compared to \nbaseline. Cimzia patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving placebo at Week 24 and Week 52 (see Table 5). In the placebo group, 52% of patients \nexperienced no radiographic progression (mTSS \u2264 0.0) at Week 52 compared to 69% in the \nCimzia 200 mg treatment group. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 5 Changes over 12 months in RA-I \n Placebo + MTX \n\nN=199 \nMean (SD) \n\nCimzia 200 mg + MTX \nN=393 \n\nMean (SD) \n\nCimzia 200 mg + MTX \u2013 \nPlacebo + MTX \nMean Difference \n\nmTSS    \nWeek 52 2.8 (7.8) 0.4 (5.7) -2.4 \nErosion Score    \nWeek 52 1.5 (4.3) 0.1 (2.5) -1.4 \nJSN Score    \nWeek 52 1.4 (5.0) 0.4 (4.2) -1.0 \np-values were < 0.001 for both mTSS and erosion score and \u2264 0.01 for JSN score.

In both clinical trials, Cimzia-treated patients reported significantly \ngreater improvements in the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summaries and all domain scores. \nImprovements in physical function and HRQoL were maintained through 2 years in the open-label \nextension to RA-I. Cimzia-treated patients reported statistically significant improvements in the Work \nProductivity Survey compared to placebo. \n \nIn C-EARLY, Cimzia+MTX-treated patients reported significant improvements at Week 52 compared \nto placebo+MTX in pain as assessed by the Patient Assessment of Arthritis Pain (PAAP) \u2013 48,5 vs \n- 44,0 (least square mean) (p<0.05). \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nDoseFlex clinical trial \nThe efficacy and safety of 2 dose regimens (200 mg every 2 weeks and 400 mg every 4 weeks) of \nCimzia versus placebo were assessed in an 18-week, open-label, run-in, and 16-week randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis \ndiagnosed according to the ACR criteria who had inadequate response to MTX. \n \nPatients received loading doses of Cimzia 400 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks during the initial open label period. Responders (achieved ACR 20) at week 16 were \nrandomised at week 18 to Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo in \ncombination with MTX for an additional 16 weeks (total trial length: 34 weeks). These 3 groups were \nwell balanced with regards to clinical response following the active run-in period (ACR 20: 83-84% at \nweek 18). \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was the ACR 20 responder rate at week 34. The results at \nweek 34 are shown in Table 7. Both Cimzia regimens showed sustained clinical response and were \nstatistically significant compared to placebo at week 34.

The axial spondyloarthritis overall \npopulation included subpopulations with and without (non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis [nr-\naxSpA]) radiographic evidence for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (also known as radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis). Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease \nActivity Index (BASDAI) \u2265 4, spinal pain \u2265 4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and \nincreased CRP or current evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Patients \nmust have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least one NSAID. Overall, 16% of \npatients had prior TNF-antagonist exposure. Patients were treated with a loading dose of \nCimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo followed by either 200 mg of \nCimzia every 2 weeks or 400 mg of Cimzia every 4 weeks or placebo. 87.7% of patients received \nconcomitant NSAIDs. The primary efficacy endpoint was the ASAS20 response rate at Week 12. \nThe 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of the study was followed by a 24-\nweek dose-blind treatment period, and a 156-week open-label treatment period. The maximum \nduration of the study was 204 weeks. All patients received Cimzia in both the dose-blind and open-\n\n\n\n19 \n\nlabel follow-up periods. A total of 199 subjects (61.2% of randomized subjects) completed the study \nthrough Week 204.  \n \nKey efficacy outcomes \nIn AS001 clinical trial, at Week 12 ASAS20 responses were achieved by 58% of patients receiving \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and 64% of patients receiving Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks as \ncompared to 38% of patients receiving placebo (p<0.01). In the overall population, the percentage of \nASAS20 responders was clinically relevant and significantly higher for the Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks and Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks treatment groups compared to placebo group at \nevery visit from Week 1 through Week 24 (p\u22640.001 at each visit). At Weeks 12 and 24, the percentage \nof subjects with an ASAS40 response was greater in the Cimzia-treated groups compared to placebo.  \n \nSimilar results were achieved in both the ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis subpopulations. In women, ASAS20 responses were not statistically significantly \ndifferent from placebo until after the Week 12 time point. \n \nImprovements in ASAS5/6, Partial Remission and BASDAI-50 were statistically signficant at \nWeek 12 and Week 24 and were sustained up to Week 48 in the overall popualtion as well as in the \nsubpopulations. Key efficacy outcomes from the AS001 clinical trial are shown in Table -8. Among \npatients remaining in the study, improvements in all afore-mentioned key efficacy outcomes were \nmaintained through Week 204 in the overall population as well as in the subpopulations. \n \nTable 8 Key efficacy outcomes in AS001 clinical trial (percent of patients) \n\n \n \n\nParameters \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis Non-radiographic \naxial \n\nspondyloarthritits \n\n Axial \nspondyloarthritis \n\nOverall Population \n Placebo \n\nN=57 \nCimzia \n\nall dosing \nregimens(a) \n\nN=121 \n\nPlacebo \nN=50 \n\nCimzia all \ndosing \n\nregimens(a) \nN=97 \n\nPlacebo \nN=107 \n\n \n\nCimzia all \ndosing \n\nregimens(a) \nN=218 \n\nASAS20(b,c) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n37% \n33% \n\n \n60%* \n\n69%** \n\n \n40% \n24% \n\n \n61%* \n\n68%** \n\n \n38% \n29% \n\n \n61%** \n68%** \n\nASAS40(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n19% \n16% \n\n \n45%** \n53%** \n\n \n16% \n14% \n\n \n47%** \n51%** \n\n \n18% \n15% \n\n \n46%** \n52%** \n\nASAS 5/6(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n9% \n5% \n\n \n42%** \n40%** \n\n \n8% \n4% \n\n \n44%** \n45%** \n\n \n8% \n5% \n\n \n43%** \n42%** \n\nPartial remission(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n2% \n7% \n\n \n20%** \n28%** \n\n \n6% \n10% \n\n \n29%** \n33%** \n\n \n4% \n9% \n\n \n24%** \n30%** \n\nBASDAI 50(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n11% \n16% \n\n \n41%** \n49%** \n\n \n16% \n20% \n\n \n49%** \n57%** \n\n \n13% \n18% \n\n \n45%** \n52%** \n\n(a) Cimzia all dosing regimen = data from Cimzia 200 mg administered every 2 weeks preceded by a \nloading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 plus Cimzia 400 mg administered every 4 weeks preceded \nby a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n(b) Results are from the randomized set \n(c) Wald p-values are quoted for the comparison of treatments using logistic regression with factors for \ntreatment and region.  \n(d) Full Analysis Set  \nNA = not available \n*p\u22640.05, Cimzia vs placebo \n**p<0.001, Cimzia vs placebo \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nSpinal mobility \nSpinal mobility was assessed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled period by using BASMI at \nseveral time points including Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. Clinically meaningful and statistically \nsignificant differences in Cimzia-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients were \ndemonstrated at each post-baseline visit. The difference from placebo tended to be greater in nr-axSpA \nthan in the AS subpopulation which may be due to less chronic structural damage in nr-axSpA \npatients. \nThe improvement in BASMI linear score achieved at Week 24 was maintained through Week 204 for \npatients who remained in the study. \n \nPhysical function response and health-related outcomes  \nIn the AS001 clinical trial, Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in physical \nfunction as assessed by the BASFI and in pain as assessed by the Total and Nocturnal Back Pain NRS \nscales as compared to placebo. Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in tiredness \n(fatigue) as reported by the BASDAI-fatigue item and in health-related quality of life as measured by \nthe ankylosing spondylitis QoL (ASQoL) and the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summaries \nand all domain scores as compared to placebo. Cimzia-treated patients reported significant \nimprovements in axial spondyloarthritis-related productivity at work and within household, as reported \nby the Work Productivity Survey as compared to placebo. For patients remaining in the study, \nimprovements in all afore-mentioned outcomes were largely maintained through Week 204. \n \nInhibition of inflammation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) \nIn an imaging sub-study including 153 patients, signs of inflammation were assessed by MRI at \nweek 12 and expressed as change from baseline in SPARCC (Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium \nof Canada) score for sacroiliac joints and ASspiMRI-a score in the Berlin modifications for the spine. \nAt week 12, significant inhibition of inflammatory signs in both sacroiliac joints and the spine was \nobserved in the Cimzia-treated patients (all dose group), in the overall axial spondyloarthritis \npopulation as well as in the sub-populations of ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis. \nAmong patients remaining in the study, who had both baseline values and week 204 values, inhibition \nof inflammatory signs in both the sacroiliac joints (n=72) and spine (n=82) was largely maintained \nthrough Week 204 in the overall axial spondyloarthritis population as well as in both the AS and the \nnr-axSpA subpopulations. \n \n\nC-OPTIMISE \n\nThe efficacy and safety of dose reduction and treatment withdrawal in patients in sustained remission \nwere assessed in adult patients (18-45 years of age) with early active axSpA (symptom duration of less \nthan 5 years), an ASDAS score \u22652.1 (and similar disease inclusion criteria as in the AS001 study), and \nwho had inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs or an intolerance to or contraindication for \nNSAIDs. Patients included both the AS and nr-axSpA subpopulations of axSpA, and were enrolled \ninto an open-label run-in 48-Week period (Part A) during which they all received 3 loading doses of \nCimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks from Week 6 to Week \n46.   \n\nPatients who achieved sustained remission (defined as having inactive disease [ASDAS<1.3] over a \nperiod of at least 12 weeks) and remained in remission at week 48, were randomized into Part B and \nreceived either Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (N=104), Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks (dose \nreduction, N=105), or placebo (treatment withdrawal, N=104) for 48 Weeks.  \n\nThe primary efficacy variable was the percentage of patients who did not experience a flare during \nPart B. \n\nPatients who experienced a flare in Part B, ie, had an ASDAS \u22652.1 at 2 consecutive visits or \nASDAS >3.5 at any visit during Part B, received escape treatment of Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \nfor at least 12 weeks (with a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Week 0, 2 and 4 in placebo-treated \npatients).  \n\n\n\n21 \n\nClinical response \n\nThe percentage of patients who achieved sustained remission at Week 48 in Part A was 43.9% for the \noverall axSpA population, and was similar in the nr-axSpA (45.3%) and AS (42.8%) subpopulations. \n\nAmong the patients who were randomized in Part B (N=313), a statistically significant (p <0.001, \nNRI) greater proportion of patients did not experience a flare when continuing treatment with \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (83.7%) or Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks (79.0%) compared with \ntreatment withdrawal (20.2%).   \n\nThe difference in time to flare between the treatment withdrawal group and either of the Cimzia \ntreatment groups, was statistically significant (p<0.001 for each comparison) and clinically \nmeaningful. In the placebo group, flares started approximately 8 weeks after Cimzia was withdrawn, \nwith the majority of flares occurring within 24 weeks of treatment withdrawal (Figure 1).  \n\nFigure 1  Kaplan-Meier curve of time to flare \n\n \nNon responder imputation (NRI) was used; Results are for the Randomized Set \nNote: Time to flare was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the flare. For study participants who did not have a  \nflare, the time to flare was censored at the date of Week 96 Visit. \nThe Kaplan-Meier plot was truncated to 97 weeks when <5% of participants were still remaining in the study. \n \n\nResults for Part B are presented in Table 9. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nTable 9  Maintenance of clinical response in Part B at Week 96  \n\nEndpoints \n\nPlacebo \n(treatment \n\nwithdrawal) \nN=104 \n\nCIMZIA 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks \n\nN=104 \n\nCIMZIA 200 mg  \n\nevery 4 weeks \nN=105 \n\nASDAS-MI, n (%)1  \nPart B Baseline (Week 48) 84 (80.8) 90 (86.5) 89 (84.8) \n\nWeek 96 11 (10.6) 70 (67.3)* 61 (58.1)* \n\nASAS40, n (%)1  \n\nPart B Baseline (Week 48) 101 (97.1) 103 (99.0) 101 (96.2) \n\nWeek 96 22 (21.2) 88 (84.6)* 77 (73.3)* \n\nBASDAI change from Part B \nbaseline (Week 48), LS mean (SE)2  \n\nWeek 96 3.02 (0.226) 0.56 (0.176)* 0.78 (0.176)* \n\nASDAS change from Part B \nbaseline (Week 48), LS mean (SE)2  \n\nWeek 96 1.66 (0.110) 0.24 (0.077)* 0.45 (0.077)* \n1 Non responder imputation (NRI) was used; Results are for the Randomized Set \n2 mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) was used; Results are for the Randomized Set \nASDAS-MI = Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-Major Improvement; ASAS: Assessment of Sponyloarthritis international \nSociety; ASAS40= ASAS40% response criteria; SE = Standard error;  \nNote: ASDAS major improvement is defined as a reduction from Baseline \u22652.0.  \nNote: Part A Baseline was used as a reference to define ASDAS clinical improvement variables and ASAS variables  \n* Nominal p<0.001, CIMZIA vs. placebo \n\n \n\nInhibition of inflammation in Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) \nIn Part B, signs of inflammation were assessed by MRI at Week 48 and at Week 96 and expressed as \nchange from baseline in SIJ SPARCC and ASspiMRI-a score in the Berlin modifications. Patients who \nwere in sustained remission at Week 48 had no or very low inflammation, and no meaningful increase \nin inflammation was observed at Week 96 irrespective of their treatment group. \n \nRetreatment in patients that experience a flare \nIn Part B, 70% (73/104) placebo-treated patients, 14% (15/105) patients treated with Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 4 weeks and 6.7% (7/104) patients treated with Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks experienced a flare \nand were subsequently treated with Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks.  \nAmong the 15 patients who flared in the group allocated to Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks, all patients \ncompleted 12 weeks of rescue therapy with Cimzia and had available ASDAS data, out of which 12 \n(80%) had ASDAS Low or Inactive disease (i.e. all ASDAS <2.1) after 12 weeks of restarting the open-\nlabel treatment. \nAmong the 73 patients who flared in the group allocated to treatment withdrawal, 71 patients completed \n12 weeks of rescue therapy with Cimzia and had available ASDAS data, out of which 64 (90%) had \nASDAS Low or Inactive disease (i.e. all ASDAS < 2.1) after 12 weeks of restarting the open-label \ntreatment.  \nBased on the results from C-OPTIMISE, a dose reduction in patients in sustained remission after one \nyear of treatment with Cimzia may be considered (see section 4.2). Withdrawal of Cimzia treatment is \nassociated with a high risk of flare. \n \nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in a 52 weeks multicenter, randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study (AS0006) in 317 patients \u226518 years of age with adult-onset axial \n\n\n\n23 \n\nspondyloarthritis and back pain for at least 12 months. Patients had to fulfil ASAS criteria for nr- \naxSpA (not including family history and good response to NSAIDs), and have had objective signs of \ninflammation indicated by C-reactive protein (CRP) levels above the upper limit of normal and/or \nsacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), indicative of inflammatory disease [positive CRP \n(> ULN) and/or positive MRI], but without definitive radiographic evidence of structural damage on \nsacroiliac joints. Patients had active disease as defined by the BASDAI \u22654, and spinal pain \u22654 on \na 0 to 10 NRS. Patients must have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least two \nNSAIDs. Patients were treated with placebo or a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at \nWeeks 0, 2 and 4 followed by 200 mg of Cimzia every 2 weeks. Utilization and dose adjustment of \nstandard of care medication (SC) (e.g., NSAIDs, DMARDs, corticosteroids, analgesics) were \npermitted at any time. The primary efficacy variable was the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity \nScore major improvement (ASDAS-MI) response at Week 52. ASDAS-MI response was defined as an \nASDAS reduction (improvement) \u2265 2.0 relative to baseline or as reaching the lowest possible score. \nASAS 40 was a secondary endpoint.  \nAt baseline, 37 % and 41% of patients had high disease activity (ASDAS \u22652.1, \u22643.5) and 62% and \n58% of patient had very high disease activity (ASDAS >3.5) in the CIMZIA group and placebo group \nrespectively.  \n \nClinical response \nStudy AS0006, performed in subjects without radiographic signs of inflammation in the SI joints, \nconfirmed the effect previously demonstrated in this subgroup in the AS001 study.  \nAt Week 52, a statistically significant greater proportion of patients treated with Cimzia achieved \nASDAS-MI response compared to patients treated with placebo. Cimzia-treated patients also had \nimprovements compared to placebo in multiple components of axial spondyloarthritis disease activity, \nincluding CRP. At both Week 12 and 52, ASAS 40 responses were significantly greater than placebo. \nKey results are presented in Table 10. \n \nTable 10: ASDAS-MI and ASAS 40 responses in AS0006 (percent of patients) \n\nParameters Placebo N=158 \nCimziaa 200 mg every 2 weeks \nN=159 \n\nASDAS-MI  \nWeek 52 \n\n \n7% \n \n\n \n47%* \n\nASAS 40 \nWeek 12 \n \nWeek 52 \n\n \n11% \n \n16% \n\n \n48%* \n \n57%* \n\na Cimzia administered every 2 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n* p<0.001 \nAll percents reflect the proportion of patients who responded in the full analysis set.  \n \nAt Week 52, the percentage of patients achieving ASDAS inactive disease (ASDAS < 1.3) was 36.4 % \nfor the Cimzia group compared to 11.8 % for the placebo group. \n\n \nAt Week 52, patients treated with Cimzia showed a clinical meaningful improvement in the MASES \ncompared to placebo (LS mean change from baseline -2.4; -0.2 respectively).  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo \ncontrolled clinical trial (PsA001) in 409 patients \u2265 18 years of age with adult-onset active psoriatic \narthritis for at least 6 months as defined by the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis \n(CASPAR) criteria. Patients had \u2265 3 swollen and tender joints and increased acute phase reactants. \nPatients also had active psoriatic skin lesions or a documented history of psoriasis and had failed 1 or \nmore DMARDs. Previous treatment with one TNF-antagonist was allowed and 20% of patients had \nprior TNF-antagonist exposure. Patients received a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at \nWeeks 0, 2 and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo followed by either Cimzia 200 mg \n\n\n\n24 \n\nevery 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo every 2 weeks. Patients receiving concomitant \nNSAIDs and conventional DMARDs were 72.6% and 70.2% respectively. The two primary endpoints \nwere the percentage of patients achieving ACR 20 response at Week 12 and change from baseline in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 24. Efficacy and safety of Cimzia in patients with PsA \nwhose predominant symptoms were sacroiliitis or axial spondyloarthritis have not been separately \nanalysed. \nThe 24-week double-blind placebo controlled treatment period of the study was followed by \na 24-week dose-blind treatment period and an 168-week open-label treatment period. The maximum \nduration of the study was 216 weeks. All patients received Cimzia in both the dose-blind and open-\nlabel follow-up periods. A total of 264 subjects (64.5%) completed the study through Week 216. \n \nACR response \nCimzia-treated patients had a statistically significant higher ACR 20 response rate at Week 12 and \nWeek 24 compared with placebo-treated patients (p<0.001). The percentage of ACR 20 responders \nwas clinically relevant for the Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks \ntreatment groups compared to placebo group at every visit after baseline through Week 24 (nominal \np\u22640.001 at each visit). Cimzia treated patients also had significant improvements in \nACR 50 and 70 response rates. At week 12 and 24 improvements in parameters of peripheral activity \ncharacteristic of psoriatic arthritis (e.g. number of swollen joints, number of painful/tender joints, \ndactylitis and enthesitis) were seen in the Cimzia-treated patients (nominal p-value p<0.01).  \nKey efficacy outcomes from the PsA001 clinical trial are shown in Table 11. \n \nTable 11: Key efficacy outcomes in PsA001 clinical trial (percent of patients) \nResponse Placebo \n\n \nN=136 \n\nCimzia(a)200 mg \nQ2W \nN=138 \n\nCimzia(b) 400 mg \nQ4W \nN=135 \n\nACR20 \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n24% \n24% \n\n \n58%** \n64%** \n\n \n52%** \n56%** \n\nACR50 \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n11% \n13% \n\n \n36%** \n44%** \n\n \n33%** \n40%** \n\nACR70 \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n3% \n4% \n\n \n25%** \n28%** \n\n \n13%* \n24%** \n\nResponse Placebo \n \n\nN=86 \n\nCimzia(a)200 mg \nQ2W \nN=90 \n\nCimzia(b) 400 mg \nQ4W \nN=76 \n\nPASI 75 (c) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \nWeek 48 \n\n \n14% \n15% \nN/A \n\n \n47%*** \n62%*** \n67% \n\n \n47%*** \n61%*** \n62% \n\n(a) Cimzia administered every 2 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n(b) Cimzia administered every 4 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n(c) In subjects with at least 3% psoriasis BSA at Baseline \n*p<0.01, Cimzia vs placebo \n**p<0.001, Cimzia vs placebo  \n***p<0.001(nominal), Cimzia vs placebo  \nResults are from the randomized set.Treatment Difference: Cimzia 200 mg-placebo, Cimzia 400 mg-  \nplacebo (and corresponding 95% CI and p-value) are estimated using a standard two-sided Wald \nasymptotic standard errors test. Non-responder Imputation (NRI) is used for patients who escaped \ntherapy or had missing data. \n\n \nAmong 273 patients initially randomised to Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 400 mg \nevery 4 weeks, 237 (86.8%) were still on this treatment at Week 48. Of the 138 patients randomised to \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, 92, 68 and 48 had an ACR 20/50/70 response, at Week 48, \n\n\n\n25 \n\nrespectively. Of the 135 patients randomised to Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks, 89, 62 and 41 patients \nhad an ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively.  \n \nAmong patients remaining in the study, ACR 20, 50 and 70 response rates were maintained through \nWeek 216. This was also the case for the other parameters of peripheral activity (e.g. number of \nswollen joints, number of painful/tender joints, dactylitis and enthesitis).  \n \nRadiographic response \nIn PsA001 clinical trial, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically \nand expressed as the change in modified total Sharp score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion \nScore (ES) and Joint Space Narrowing score (JSN) at Week 24, compared to baseline. The mTSS \nScore was modified for psoriatic arthritis by addition of hand distal interphalangeal joints. Cimzia \ntreatment inhibited the radiographic progression compared with placebo treatment at Week 24 as \nmeasured by change from baseline in total mTSS Score (LS mean [\u00b1SE] score was 0.28 [\u00b10.07] in the \nplacebo group compared with 0.06 [\u00b10.06] in the Cimzia all doses group; p=0.007). Inhibition of \nradiographic progression was maintained with Cimzia treatment up to Week 48 in the subset of \npatients at higher risk of radiographic progression (patients with a Baseline mTSS score of > 6). \nInhibition of radiographic progression was further maintained up to Week 216 for the patients who \nremained in the study. \n \nPhysical function response and health-related outcomes \nIn PsA001 clinical trial, Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in physical \nfunction as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire \u2013 Disability Index (HAQ-DI), in pain as \nassessed by the PAAP and in tiredness (fatigue) as reported by the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) as \ncompared to placebo. Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in health-related \nquality of life as measured by the psoriatic arthritis QoL (PsAQoL) and the SF-36 Physical and Mental \nComponents and in psoriatic arthritis-related productivity at work and within household, as reported \nby the Work Productivity Survey compared to placebo. Improvements in all afore-mentioned \noutcomes were maintained through Week 216.  \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in two placebo-controlled studies (CIMPASI-1 and \nCIMPASI-2) and one placebo- and active-controlled study (CIMPACT) in patients \u226518 years of age \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months. Patients had a Psoriasis Area \nand Severity Index (PASI) score \u2265 12, body surface area (BSA) involvement of \u2265 10%, Physician \nGlobal Assessment (PGA) of \u2265 3, and were candidates for systemic therapy and/or phototherapy \nand/or chemophototherapy. Patients who were \u2018primary\u2019 non-responders on any prior biologic therapy \n(defined as no response within the first 12 weeks of treatment) were excluded from the phase III \nstudies (CIMPASI-1, CIMPASI-2 and CIMPACT). The efficacy and safety of Cimzia were evaluated \nversus etanercept in the CIMPACT study. \n \nIn studies CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 the co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of \npatients achieving PASI 75 and PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201calmost clear\u201d (with at least a 2-point reduction from \nbaseline) at Week 16. In the CIMPACT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of \npatients achieving PASI 75 at Week 12. PASI75 and PGA at Week 16 were key secondary endpoints. \nPASI 90 at Week 16 was a key secondary endpoint in all 3 studies.  \n \nCIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 evaluated 234 patients and 227 patients respectively. In both studies \npatients were randomized to receive placebo or Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (following a loading \ndose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4) or Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks. At week 16, patients \nrandomized to Cimzia who achieved a PASI 50 response continued to receive Cimzia up to \nWeek 48 at the same randomized dose. Patients originally randomized to placebo that achieved a \nPASI 50 response but not a PASI 75 response at Week 16 received Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \n(with a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 16, 18, and 20). Patients with an inadequate response \nat Week 16 (PASI 50 non-responders) were eligible to receive Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks in an \nopen-label manner for a maximum of 128 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nThe CIMPACT study evaluated 559 patients. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, or \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (following a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4), or \nCimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks up to Week 16, or etanercept 50 mg twice weekly, up to Week 12. \nPatients originally randomized to Cimzia who achieved a PASI75 response at Week 16 were re-\nrandomized based on their original dosing schedule. Patients on Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks were \nre-randomized to Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo. Patient on \nCimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks were re-randomized to Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks, or placebo. Patients were evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner \nthrough Week 48. All subjects who did not achieve a PASI 75 response at Week 16 entered an escape \narm and received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks in an open-label manner for a maximum of 128 \nweeks. \n \nIn all three studies, the blinded 48-week maintenance period was followed by a 96-week open-label \ntreatment period for the patients who were PASI 50 responders at Week 48. All these patients, \nincluding those receiving Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, started the open-label period at Cimzia 200 \nmg every 2 weeks.  \n \nPatients were predominantly men (64%) and Caucasian (94%), with a mean age of 45.7 years \n(18 to 80 years); of these, 7.2% were \u2265 65 years of age. Of the 850 patients randomized to receive \nplacebo or Cimzia in these placebo-controlled studies, 29% of patients were na\u00efve to prior systemic \ntherapy for the treatment of psoriasis. 47% had received prior phototherapy or chemophototherapy, \nand 30% had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Of the 850 patients, 14% \nhad received at least one TNF-antagonist, 13% had received an anti-IL-17, and 5% had received an \nanti-IL 12/ 23. Eighteen percent of patients reported a history of psoriatic arthritis at baseline. The \nmean PASI score at baseline was 20 and ranged from 12 to 69. The baseline PGA score ranged from \nmoderate (70%) to severe (30%).

Results are from \nthe Randomized Set. \n \nIn all 3 studies, the PASI 75 response rate was significantly greater for Cimzia compared to placebo \nstarting at Week 4. \n \nBoth doses of Cimzia demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo regardless of age, gender, body \nweight, BMI, psoriasis disease duration, previous treatment with systemic therapies and previous \ntreatment with biologics.  \n \nMaintenance of response  \nIn an integrated analysis of  CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2, among patients who were PASI 75 \nresponders at Week 16 and received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks (N=134 of 175 randomised \nsubjects) or Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (N=132 of 186 randomised subjects), the maintenance of \nresponse at Week 48 was 98.0% and 87.5%, respectively. Among patients who were PGA clear or \nalmost clear at Week 16 and received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks (N=103 of 175) or Cimzia 200 \nmg every 2 weeks (N=95 of 186), the maintenance of response at Week 48 was 85.9% and 84.3% \nrespectively. \n \nAfter an additional 96 weeks of open-label treatment (Week 144) the maintenance of response was \nevaluated. Twenty-one percent of all randomised subjects were lost to follow-up before Week 144. \nApproximately 27% of completer study subjects who entered the open-label treatment between weeks \n48 to 144 on Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks had their dose increased to Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks \nfor maintenance of response. In an analysis in which all patients with treatment failures were \nconsidered non-responders, the maintenance of response of the Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \ntreatment group for the respective endpoint, after an additional 96 weeks of open-label therapy, was \n84.5% for PASI 75 for study subjects who were responders at Week 16  and 78.4% for PGA clear or \nalmost clear. The maintenance of response of the Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks treatment group, who \nentered the open-label period at Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, was 84.7% for PASI 75 for study \nsubjects who were responders at Week 16 and 73.1% for PGA clear or almost clear.  \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nThese response rates were based on a logistic regression model where missing data were imputed over \n48 or 144 weeks using multiple imputation (MCMC method) combined with NRI for treatment \nfailures.  \n \nIn the CIMPACT study, among PASI 75 responders at Week 16 who received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 \nweeks and were re-randomized to either Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 200 mg every 2 \nweeks, or placebo, there was a higher percentage of PASI 75 responders at Week 48 in the Cimzia \ngroups as compared to placebo (98.0%, 80.0%, and 36.0%, respectively). Among PASI75 responders \nat Week 16 who received Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and were re-randomized to either Cimzia 400 \nmg every 4 weeks, Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, or placebo, there was also a higher percentage of \nPASI 75 responders at Week 48 in the Cimzia groups as compared to placebo (88.6%, 79.5%, and \n45.5%, respectively). Non-responder imputation was used for missing data. \n \nQuality of life / Patient reported outcomes \n \nStatistically significant improvements at Week 16 (CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2) from baseline \ncompared to placebo were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). Mean \ndecreases (improvements) in DLQI from baseline ranged from -8.9 to -11.1 with Cimzia 200 mg every \n2 weeks, from -9.6 to -10.0 with Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, versus -2.9 to -3.3 for placebo at \nWeek 16.  \n \nIn addition, at Week 16, Cimzia treatment was associated with a greater proportion of patients \nachieving a DLQI score of  0 or 1 (Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, 45.5% and 50.6% respectively; \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, 47.4% and 46.2% respectively, versus placebo, 5.9% and 8.2% \nrespectively).  \n \nImprovements in DLQI score were sustained or slightly decreased through Week 144. \n \nCimzia-treated patients reported greater improvements compared to placebo in the Hospital Anxiety \nand Depression Scale (HADS)-D. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nThe data below reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for \nantibodies to certolizumab pegol in an ELISA and later in a more sensitive method, and are highly \ndependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.  The observed incidence of antibody \n(including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors, \nincluding assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample \ncollection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the \nincidence of antibodies to certolizumab pegol in the studies described below with the incidence of \nantibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nThe overall percentage of patients with antibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least 1 occasion \nwas 9.6% in RA placebo-controlled trials. Approximately one-third of antibody-positive patients had \nantibodies with neutralising activity in vitro. Patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressants \n(MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients not taking immunosuppressants at \nbaseline. Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and in some \npatients, reduced efficacy. \n \nIn 2 long-term (up to 5 years of exposure) open-label studies, the overall percentage of patients with \nantibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion was 13% (8.4% of the overall patients had \ntransient formation of antibodies and an additional 4.7% had persistent formation of antibodies to \nCimzia). The overall percentage of patients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of \ndrug plasma concentration was estimated to be 9.1%. Similar to the placebo-controlled studies, \nantibody positivity was associated with reduced efficacy in some patients. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nA pharmacodynamic model based on the Phase III trial data predicts that around 15% of the patients \ndevelop antibodies in 6 months at the recommended dose regimen (200 mg every 2 weeks following a \nloading dose) without MTX co-treatment. This number decreases with increasing doses of \nconcomitant MTX treatment. These data are reasonably in agreement with observed data. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nThe overall percentage of patients with antibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion up to \nWeek 24 was 11.7% in the Phase III placebo-controlled trial in patients with psoriatic arthritis. \nAntibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration.  \n \nOver the course of the entire study (up to 4 years of exposure), the overall percentage of patients with \nantibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion was 17.3% (8.7% had transient formation and \nan additional 8.7% had persistent formation of antibodies to Cimzia). The overall percentage of \npatients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of drug plasma concentration was \nestimated to be 11.5%. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nIn the Phase III placebo- and active-controlled studies, the percentages of patients who were positive \nfor antibodies to Cimzia on at least one occasion during treatment up to Week 48 were 8.3 % (22/265) \nand 19.2% (54/281) for the Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \nrespectively. In CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2, sixty patients were antibody positive, 27 of these \npatients were evaluable for neutralizing antibodies and tested positive. First occurrences of antibody \npositivity in the open-label treatment period were observed in 2.8% (19/668) of patients. Antibody \npositivity was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and in some patients with reduced \nefficacy. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nAS001 \nThe overall percentage of patients with antibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion up to \nWeek 24 was 4.4% in the AS001 phase III placebo-controlled trial in patients with axial \nspondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nsubpopulations). Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration. \n\nOver the course of the entire study (up to 192 weeks), the overall percentage of patients with \nantibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion was 9.6% (4.8% had transient formation and \nan additional 4.8% had persistent formation of antibodies to Cimzia). The overall percentage of \npatients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of drug plasma concentration was \nestimated to be 6.8%. \n \nAS0006 and C-OPTIMISE  \nA more sensitive and drug tolerant assay was used for the first time in the AS0006 study (and later \nalso in the C-OPTIMISE study), resulting in a greater proportion of samples having measurable \nantibodies to Cimzia and thus a greater incidence of patients being classed as antibody positive. In \nAS0006,  the overall incidence of patients who were antibody positive to Cimzia was 97% \n(248/255 patients) after up to 52 weeks of treatment. Only the highest titers were associated with \nreduced Cimzia plasma levels, however, no impact on efficacy was observed. Similar results in \nrelation to antibodies to Cimzia were seen in C-OPTIMISE. Results from C-OPTIMISE also indicated \nthat a reduction of the dose to Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks did not change immunogenicity \noutcomes. \n \nAbout 22% (54/248) of the patients in AS0006 who were anti-Cimzia antibody positive at any time, \nhad antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. The neutralizing status of antibodies in C-\nOPTIMISE was not assessed.  \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nCertolizumab pegol plasma concentrations were broadly dose-proportional. Pharmacokinetics \nobserved in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis were consistent with those seen in healthy \nsubjects. \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, peak plasma concentrations of certolizumab pegol were \nattained between 54 and 171 hours post-injection. Certolizumab pegol has a bioavailability (F) of \napproximately 80% (range 76% to 88%) following subcutaneous administration compared to \nintravenous administration. \n \nDistribution \nThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was estimated at 8.01 l in a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and at 4.71 l in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of \npatients with plaque psoriasis. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nPEGylation, the covalent attachment of PEG polymers to peptides, delays the elimination of these \nentities from the circulation by a variety of mechanisms, including decreased renal clearance, \ndecreased proteolysis, and decreased immunogenicity. Accordingly, certolizumab pegol is an antibody \nFab' fragment conjugated with PEG in order to extend the terminal plasma elimination half-life of the \nFab' to a value comparable with a whole antibody product. The terminal elimination phase half-life \n(t1/2) was approximately 14 days for all doses tested.  \n \nClearance following subcutaneous dosing was estimated to be 21.0 ml/h in a rheumatoid arthritis \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, with an inter-subject variability of 30.8% (CV) and an inter-\noccasion variability of 22.0%. When assessed using the previous ELISA method, the presence of \nantibodies to certolizumab pegol resulted in an approximately three-fold increase in clearance. \nCompared with a 70 kg person, clearance is 29% lower and 38% higher, respectively, in individual RA \npatients weighing 40 kg and 120 kg. The clearance following subcutaneous dosing in patients with \npsoriasis was 14 ml/h with an inter-subject variability of 22.2% (CV). \n \nThe Fab' fragment comprises protein compounds and is expected to be degraded to peptides and amino \nacids by proteolysis. The de-conjugated PEG component is rapidly eliminated from plasma and is to \nan unknown extent excreted renally. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nSpecific clinical trials have not been performed to assess the effect of renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol or its PEG fraction. However, population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis based on subjects with mild renal impairment showed no effect of creatinine clearance. There \nare insufficient data to provide a dosing recommendation in moderate and severe renal impairment. \nThe pharmacokinetics of the PEG fraction of certolizumab pegol are expected to be dependent on \nrenal function but have not been assessed in patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nSpecific clinical trials have not been performed to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) \nSpecific clinical trials have not been performed in elderly patients subjects. However, no effect of age \nwas observed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in \nwhich 78 subjects (13.2% of the population) were aged 65 or greater and the oldest subject was \naged 83 years. No effect of age was observed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in adult \npatients with plaque psoriasis. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nGender \nThere was no effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol. As clearance decreases \nwith decreasing body weight, females may generally obtain somewhat higher systemic exposure of \ncertolizumab pegol. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nOn the basis of Phase II and Phase III clinical trial data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a \npopulation exposure-response relationship was established between average plasma concentration of \ncertolizumab pegol during a dosing interval (Cavg) and efficacy (ACR 20 responder definition). The \ntypical Cavg that produces half the maximum probability of ACR 20 response (EC50) was 17 \u00b5g/ml \n(95% CI: 10-23 \u00b5g/ml). Similarly, on the basis of Phase III clinical trial data in patients with psoriasis, \na population exposure-response relationship was established between plasma concentration of \ncertolizumab pegol and PASI with an EC90 of 11.1 \u00b5g/ml. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe pivotal non-clinical safety studies were conducted in the cynomolgus monkey. In rats and \nmonkeys, at doses higher than those given to humans, histopathology revealed cellular vacuolation, \npresent mainly in macrophages, in a number of organs (lymph nodes, injection sites, spleen, adrenal, \nuterine, cervix, choroid plexus of the brain, and in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus). It is likely \nthat this finding was caused by cellular uptake of the PEG moiety. In vitro functional studies of human \nvacuolated macrophages indicated all functions tested were retained. Studies in rats indicated that \n> 90% of the administered PEG was eliminated in 3 months following a single dose, with the urine \nbeing the main route of excretion. \n \nCertolizumab pegol does not cross-react with rodent TNF. Therefore, reproductive toxicology studies \nhave been performed with a homologous reagent recognising rat TNF. The value of these data to the \nevaluation of human risk may be limited. No adverse effects were seen on maternal well-being or \nfemale fertility, embryo-foetal and peri- and post-natal reproductive indices in rats using a rodent anti-\nrat TNF\u03b1 PEGylated Fab' (cTN3 PF) following sustained TNF\u03b1 suppression. In male rats, reduced \nsperm motility and a trend of reduced sperm count were observed. \n \nDistribution studies have demonstrated that placental and milk transfer of cTN3 PF to the foetal and \nneonatal circulation is negligible. Certolizumab pegol does not bind to the human neonatal Fc receptor \n(FcRn). Data from a human closed-circuit placental transfer model ex vivo suggest low or negligible \ntransfer to the foetal compartment. In addition, experiments of FcRn-mediated transcytosis in cells \ntransfected with human FcRn showed negligible transfer (see section 4.6).  \n \nNo mutagenic or clastogenic effects were demonstrated in preclinical studies. Carcinogenicity studies \nhave not been performed with certolizumab pegol. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nCimzia, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for: \n\uf0b7 the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including MTX, has been \ninadequate. Cimzia can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when \ncontinued treatment with MTX is inappropriate \n\n \n\uf0b7 the treatment of severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or \n\nother DMARDs. \n \nCimzia has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by  \nX-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with MTX. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nCimzia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe active axial spondyloarthritis, \ncomprising:  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) (also known as radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \nAdults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to, or are \nintolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n\n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS (also known as non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis) \nAdults with severe active axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS but with \nobjective signs of inflammation by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and /or magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI), who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to NSAIDs. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \nCimzia, in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults \nwhen the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nCimzia can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy. \n \nFor details on therapeutic effects, see section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of conditions for which Cimzia is indicated. Patients should be given the special reminder \ncard. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis \n \nLoading dose \nThe recommended starting dose of Cimzia for adult patients is 400 mg (given \nas 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) at weeks 0, 2 and 4. For rheumatoid arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis, MTX should be continued during treatment with Cimzia where appropriate. \n \nMaintenance dose \nRheumatoid arthritis \nAfter the starting dose, the recommended maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis is 200 mg every 2 weeks. Once clinical response is confirmed, an alternative \nmaintenance dosing of 400 mg every 4 weeks can be considered. MTX should be continued during \ntreatment with Cimzia where appropriate. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nAfter the starting dose, the recommended maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with axial \nspondyloarthritis is 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks. After at least 1 year of treatment \nwith Cimzia, in patients with sustained remission, a reduced maintenance dose of 200 mg every 4 \nweeks may be considered (see section 5.1). \n  \nPsoriatic arthritis \nAfter the starting dose, the recommended maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with psoriatic \narthritis is 200 mg every 2 weeks. Once clinical response is confirmed, an alternative maintenance \ndosing of 400 mg every 4 weeks can be considered. MTX should be continued during treatment with \nCimzia where appropriate. \n \nFor the above indications, available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who \nshow no evidence of therapeutic benefit within the first 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nAfter the starting dose, the maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with plaque psoriasis \nis 200 mg every 2 weeks. A dose of 400 mg every 2 weeks can be considered in patients with \ninsufficient response (see section 5.1). \n \nAvailable data in adults with plaque psoriasis suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 16 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who \nshow no evidence of therapeutic benefit within the first 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with an \ninitial partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nMissed dose \nPatients who miss a dose should be advised to inject the next dose of Cimzia as soon as they \nremember and then continue injecting subsequent doses as instructed. \n \nSpecial populations \nPaediatric population (< 18 years old) \nThe safety and efficacy of Cimzia in children and adolescents below age 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) \nNo dose adjustment is required. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed no effect of age (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nCimzia has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nThe total content (1 ml) of the pre-filled pen should be administered as a subcutaneous injection only. \nSuitable sites for injection would include the thigh or abdomen. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject using the pre-filled pen if their \nphysician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. The physician \nshould discuss with the patient which injection presentation option is the most appropriate. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis or opportunistic infections (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA classes III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \nPatients must be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of infections including tuberculosis before, \nduring and after treatment with Cimzia. Because the elimination of certolizumab pegol may take up \nto 5 months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period (see section 4.3). \n \nTreatment with Cimzia must not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection, \nincluding chronic or localised infections, until the infection is controlled (see section 4.3).  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Cimzia should be monitored \nclosely. Administration of Cimzia should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection \nuntil the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of \nCimzia in patients with a history of recurring or opportunistic infection or with underlying conditions \nwhich may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive \nmedications. \n \nPatients with rheumatoid arthritis may not manifest typical symptoms of infection, including fever, \ndue to their disease and concomitant medicinal products. Therefore, early detection of any infection, \n\n\n\n37 \n\nparticularly atypical clinical presentations of a serious infection, is critical to minimise delays in \ndiagnosis and initiation of treatment. \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis and tuberculosis (including miliary, disseminated and \nextrapulmonary disease), and opportunistic infections (e.g. histoplasmosis, nocardia, candidiasis) have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Cimzia. Some of these events have been fatal. \n \nTuberculosis \nBefore initiation of therapy with Cimzia, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(latent) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history for patients \nwith a personal history of tuberculosis, with possible previous exposure to others with active \ntuberculosis, and with previous and/or current use of immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate \nscreening tests, e.g. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local \nrecommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in \nthe patient's reminder card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test \nresults, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed prior to or during treatment, Cimzia therapy must not be initiated \nand must be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n \nIf inactive (\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of \ntuberculosis should be consulted. In all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of Cimzia \ntherapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy must be started before \ninitiating treatment with Cimzia and in accordance with local recommendations.  \nUse of anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered before the initiation of Cimzia in patients \nwith a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be \nconfirmed, and in patients who have significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \nlatent tuberculosis. Biological tests for tuberculosis screening should be considered before starting \nCimzia treatment if there is any potential latent tuberculosis infection, regardless of BCG vaccination. \n \nDespite previous or concomitant prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of active tuberculosis \nhave occurred in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including Cimzia. Some patients who have \nbeen successfully treated for active tuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated \nwith Cimzia. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g. persistent cough, \nwasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during \nor after therapy with Cimzia. \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including certolizumab \npegol, who are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e., surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a \nfatal outcome.  \n \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Cimzia. For patients who \ntest positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended.  \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Cimzia should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Cimzia should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nThe potential role of TNF-antagonist therapy in the development of malignancies is not known. \nCaution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of \nmalignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop malignancy.  \n \nWith the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other \nmalignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n \nIn clinical trials with Cimzia and other TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma and other \nmalignancies have been reported among patients receiving TNF-antagonists than in control patients \nreceiving placebo (see section 4.8). In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. \n \nNo trials have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy, or that continue \ntreatment in patients who develop malignancy, while receiving Cimzia.  \n \nSkin cancers \nMelanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists \nincluding certolizumab pegol (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended, \nparticularly for patients with risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nPaediatric malignancy \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up \nto 22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age) in the post \nmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a \nvariety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated \nwith TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), have been reported in patients \ntreated with TNF-antagonists. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course \nand is usually fatal. The majority of reported TNF-antagonist cases occurred in adolescent and young \nadult males with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. Almost all of these patients had received \ntreatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine and/or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a \nTNF-antagonist at or prior to diagnosis. A risk for development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in \npatients treated with Cimzia cannot be excluded. \n \nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \nCongestive heart failure \nCimzia is contraindicated in moderate or severe heart failure (see section 4.3). In a clinical trial with \nanother TNF-antagonist, worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality due to congestive \nheart failure have been observed. Cases of congestive heart failure have also been reported in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients receiving Cimzia. Cimzia should be used with caution in patients with \nmild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Treatment with Cimzia must be discontinued in patients who \ndevelop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nHaematological reactions \nReports of pancytopaenia, including aplastic anaemia, have been rare with TNF-antagonists. Adverse \nreactions of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopaenia (e.g. leukopaenia, \npancytopaenia, thrombocytopaenia) have been reported with Cimzia (see section 4.8). All patients \nshould be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive \nof blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Cimzia. \nDiscontinuation of Cimzia therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant \nhaematological abnormalities. \n \nNeurological events \nUse of TNF-antagonists has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical \nsymptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis. In \npatients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disorders, the benefits and risks of \nTNF-antagonist treatment should be carefully considered before initiation of Cimzia therapy. Rare \ncases of neurological disorders, including seizure disorder, neuritis and peripheral neuropathy, have \nbeen reported in patients treated with Cimzia. \n \nHypersensitivity \nSevere hypersensitivity reactions have been reported rarely following Cimzia administration. Some of \nthese reactions occurred after the first administration of Cimzia. If severe reactions occur, \nadministration of Cimzia should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted.  \n \nThere are limited data on the use of Cimzia in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity \nreaction towards another TNF-antagonist; in these patients caution is needed. \n  \nLatex-sensitivity  \nThe needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA pre-filled pen contains a derivative of \nnatural rubber latex (see section 6.5). Contact with natural rubber latex may cause severe allergic \nreactions in individuals sensitive to latex. No antigenic latex protein has to date been detected in the \nremovable needle cap of the Cimzia pre-filled pen. Nevertheless, a potential risk of hypersensitivity \nreactions cannot be completely excluded in latex-sensitive individuals. \n \nImmunosuppression \nSince tumour necrosis factor (TNF) mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses, \nthe possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including Cimzia, to cause immunosupression, affecting \nhost defences against infections and malignancies. \n \nAutoimmunity \nTreatment with Cimzia may result in the formation of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and, \nuncommonly, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome (see section 4.8). The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Cimzia on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Cimzia, treatment must be \ndiscontinued. Cimzia has not been studied specifically in a lupus population (see section 4.8). \n \nVaccinations \nPatients treated with Cimzia may receive vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available \non the response to live vaccinations or the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in \npatients receiving Cimzia. Live vaccines should not be administered concurrently with Cimzia. \n \nIn a placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, similar antibody response \nbetween Cimzia and placebo treatment were observed when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine \nand influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with Cimzia. Patients receiving Cimzia and \nconcomitant methotrexate had a lower humoral response compared with patients receiving Cimzia \nalone. The clinical significance of this is unknown.  \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nConcomitant use with other biologics \nSevere infections and neutropaenia were reported in clinical trials with concurrent use of anakinra (an \ninterleukin-1 antagonist) or abatacept (a CD28 modulator) and another TNF-antagonist, etanercept, \nwith no added benefit compared to TNF-antagonist therapy alone. Because of the nature of the adverse \nevents seen with the combination of another TNF-antagonist with either abatacept or anakinra therapy, \nsimilar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra or abatacept and other \nTNF-antagonists. Therefore the use of certolizumab pegol in combination with anakinra or abatacept \nis not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \nThere is limited safety experience with surgical procedures in patients treated with Cimzia. The 14-day \nhalf-life of certolizumab pegol should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. \nA patient who requires surgery while on Cimzia should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. \n \nActivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay \nInterference with certain coagulation assays has been detected in patients treated with Cimzia. Cimzia \nmay cause erroneously elevated aPTT assay results in patients without coagulation abnormalities. This \neffect has been observed with the PTT-Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) test and Standard Target Activated \nPartial Thromboplastin time (STA-PTT) Automate tests from Diagnostica Stago, and the HemosIL \nAPTT-SP liquid and HemosIL lyophilised silica tests from Instrumentation Laboratories. Other aPTT \nassays may be affected as well. There is no evidence that Cimzia therapy has an effect on coagulation \nin vivo. After patients receive Cimzia, careful attention should be given to interpretation of abnormal \ncoagulation results. Interference with thrombin time (TT) and prothrombin time (PT) assays have not \nbeen observed. \n \nElderly patients \nIn the clinical trials, there was an apparently higher incidence of infections among subjects \u2265 65 years \nof age, compared to younger subjects, although experience is limited. Caution should be exercised \nwhen treating the elderly patients, and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of \ninfections. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant treatment with methotrexate, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs) and analgesics showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetics analysis. \n \nThe combination of certolizumab pegol and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of Cimzia with methotrexate had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nmethotrexate. In study-to-study comparison, the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol appeared \nsimilar to those observed previously in healthy subjects. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \nThe use of adequate contraception should be considered for women of childbearing potential. For \nwomen planning pregnancy, continued contraception may be considered for 5 months after the last \nCimzia dose due to its elimination rate (see section 5.2), but the need for treatment of the woman \nshould also be taken into account (see below). \n \nPregnancy \nData from more than 500 prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to Cimzia with known \npregnancy outcomes, including more than 400 pregnancies exposed during the first trimester, does not \nindicate a malformative effect of Cimzia. However, the available clinical experience is too limited to, \n\n\n\n41 \n\nwith a reasonable certainty, conclude that there is no increased risk associated with Cimzia \nadministration during pregnancy. \n \nAnimal studies using a rodent anti-rat TNF\u03b1 did not reveal evidence of impaired fertility or harm to \nthe foetus. However, these are insufficient with respect to human reproductive toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). Due to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, Cimzia administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune response in the newborn.  \n \nCimzia should only be used during pregnancy if clinically needed. \n \nNon-clinical studies suggest low or negligible level of placental transfer of a homologue Fab-fragment \nof certolizumab pegol (no Fc region) (see section 5.3). \n \nIn a clinical study 16 women were treated with certolizumab pegol (200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg \nevery 4 weeks) during pregnancy. Certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations measured in 14 infants at \nbirth were Below the Limit of Quantification (BLQ) in 13 samples; one was 0.042 \u00b5g/ml with an \ninfant/mother plasma ratio at birth of 0.09%. At Week 4 and Week 8, all infant concentrations were \nBLQ. The clinical significance of low levels certolizumab pegol for infants is unknown. It is \nrecommended to wait a minimum of 5 months following the mother\u2019s last Cimzia administration \nduring pregnancy before administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine), unless \nthe benefit of the vaccination clearly outweighs the theoretical risk of administration of live or live-\nattenuated vaccines to the infants. \n \nBreastfeeding \nIn a clinical study in 17 lactating women treated with Cimzia, minimal transfer of certolizumab pegol \nfrom plasma to breast milk was observed. The percentage of the maternal certolizumab pegol dose \nreaching an infant during a 24 hour period was estimated to 0.04% to 0.30 %. In addition, since \ncertolizumab pegol is a protein that is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, \nthe absolute bioavailability is expected to be very low in a breastfed infant. \n \nConsequently, Cimzia can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nEffects on sperm motility measures and a trend of reduced sperm count in male rodents have been \nobserved with no apparent effect on fertility (see section 5.3).  \n \nIn a clinical trial to assess the effect of certolizumab pegol on semen quality parameters, 20 healthy \nmale subjects were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of 400 mg of certolizumab pegol \nor placebo. During the 14-week follow-up, no treatment effects of certolizumab pegol were seen on \nsemen quality parameters compared to placebo. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCimzia may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness (including \nvertigo, vision disorder and fatigue) may occur following administration of Cimzia (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nCimzia was studied in 4,049 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in controlled and open label trials for \nup to 92 months.  \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies, patients receiving Cimzia had an approximately 4 times greater \nduration of exposure compared with the placebo group. This difference in exposure is primarily due to \n\n\n\n42 \n\npatients on placebo being more likely to withdraw early. In addition, Studies RA-I and RA-II had a \nmandatory withdrawal for non-responders at Week 16, the majority of whom were on placebo. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the controlled \ntrials was 4.4% for patients treated with Cimzia and 2.7% for patients treated with placebo. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions belonged to the system organ classes Infections and infestations, \nreported in 14.4% of patients on Cimzia and 8.0% of patients on placebo, General disorders and \nadministration site conditions, reported in 8.8% of patients on Cimzia and 7.4% of patients on placebo, \nand Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, reported in 7.0% of patients on Cimzia and 2.4% of \npatients on placebo. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nCimzia was initially studied in 325 patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing \nspondylitis and non-radiopraphic axial spondyloarthritis) in the AS001 clinical study for up to 4 years, \nwhich includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and \na 156-week open-label treatment period. Cimzia was subsequently studied in 317 patients with non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis in a placebo-controlled study for 52 weeks (AS0006). Cimzia was \nalso studied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in a clinical study for up to 96 weeks, which included a 48-week \nopen-label run-in phase (N=736) followed by a 48-week placebo-controlled phase (N=313) for \npatients in sustained remission (C-OPTIMISE). In all 3 studies, the safety profile for these patients \nwas consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous experience with Cimzia. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \nCimzia was studied in 409 patients with psoriatic arthritis in the PsA001 clinical study for up \nto 4 years which includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind \nperiod and a 168-week open-label treatment period. The safety profile for psoriatic arthritis patients \ntreated with Cimzia was consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous \nexperience with Cimzia. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia was studied in 1112 patients with psoriasis in controlled and open-label studies for up to 3 \nyears. In the Phase III program, the initial and maintenance periods were followed by a 96-week open-\nlabel treatment period (see section 5.1). The long-term safety profile of Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks \nand Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks was generally similar and consistent with previous experience with \nCimzia. \n \nDuring controlled clinical trials through Week 16, the proportion of patients with serious adverse \nevents was 3.5% for Cimzia and 3.7% for placebo.  \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events in the controlled clinical \nstudies was 1.5% for patients treated with Cimzia and 1.4% for patients treated with placebo.  \n \nThe most common adverse reactions reported through Week 16 belonged to the system organ classes \nInfections and infestations, reported in 6.1% of patients on Cimzia and 7% of patients on placebo, \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions, reported in 4.1% of patients on Cimzia and 2.3% \nof patients on placebo, and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, reported in 3.5% of patients on \nCimzia and 2.8% of patients on placebo. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reactions based primarily on experience from the placebo-controlled clinical trials \nand postmarketing cases at least possibly related to Cimzia are listed in Table 1 below, according to \nfrequency and system organ class. Frequency categories are defined as follows: Very common \n(\u2265 1/10); Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100); Rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1000); Very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata).

following adverse reactions have been observed uncommonly with Cimzia in other \nindications: gastrointestinal stenosis and obstructions, general physical health deterioration, abortion \nspontaneous and azoospermia. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections \nThe incidence rate of new cases of infections in placebo-controlled clinical trials in rheumatoid \narthritis was 1.03 per patient-year for all Cimzia-treated patients and 0.92 per patient-year for placebo-\ntreated patients. The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract \ninfections, and lower respiratory tract infections and herpes viral infections (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nIn the placebo-controlled clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis, there were more new cases of serious \ninfection in the Cimzia treatment groups (0.07 per patient-year; all doses), compared with placebo \n(0.02 per patient-year). The most frequent serious infections included pneumonia, tuberculosis \ninfections. Serious infections also included invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. pneumocystosis, \nfungal oesophagitis, nocardiosis and herpes zoster disseminated). There is no evidence of an increased \nrisk of infections with continued exposure over time (see section 4.4). \n \nThe incidence rate of new cases of infections in placebo-controlled clinical trials in psoriasis \nwas 1.37 per patient-year for all Cimzia-treated patients and 1.59 per patient-year for placebo-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections and viral infections \n(including herpes infections). The incidence of serious infections was 0.02 per patient-year in Cimzia \ntreated patients. No serious infections were reported in the placebo-treated patients. There is no \nevidence of an increased risk of infections with continued exposure over time. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nExcluding non-melanoma of the skin, 121 malignancies including 5 cases of lymphoma were observed \nin the Cimzia RA clinical trials in which a total of 4,049 patients were treated, \nrepresenting 9,277 patient-years. Cases of lymphoma occurred at an incidence rate \nof 0.05 per 100 patient-years and melanoma at an incidence rate of 0.08 per 100 patient-years with \nCimzia in rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials (see section 4.4). One case of lymphoma was also \nobserved in the Phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical trial. \n \nExcluding non-melanoma skin cancer, 11 malignancies including 1 case of lymphoma were observed \nin the Cimzia psoriasis clinical trials in which a total of 1112 patients were treated, representing 2300 \npatient-years. \n \nAutoimmunity \nIn the rheumatoid arthritis pivotal studies, for subjects who were ANA negative at baseline, 16.7% of \nthose treated with Cimzia developed positive ANA titers, compared with 12.0% of subjects in the \nplacebo group. For subjects who were anti-dsDNA antibody negative at baseline, 2.2% of those treated \nwith Cimzia developed positive anti-dsDNA antibody titers, compared with 1.0% of subjects in the \nplacebo group. In both placebo-controlled and open-label follow-up clinical trials for rheumatoid \narthritis, cases of lupus-like syndrome were reported uncommonly. There have been rare reports of \nother immune-mediated conditions; the causal relationship to Cimzia is not known. The impact of \nlong-term treatment with Cimzia on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. \n \nInjection site reactions \nIn the placebo-controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials, 5.8% of patients treated with Cimzia \ndeveloped injection site reactions such as erythema, itching, haematoma, pain, swelling or bruising, \ncompared to 4.8% of patients receiving placebo. Injection site pain was observed in 1.5% of patients \ntreated with Cimzia with no cases leading to withdrawal. \n \nCreatine phosphokinase elevations \nThe frequency of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations was generally higher in patients with \naxSpA as compared to the RA population. The frequency was increased both in patients treated with \nplacebo (2.8% vs 0.4% in axSpA and RA populations, respectively) as well as in patients treated with \nCimzia (4.7% vs 0.8% in axSpA and RA populations, respectively). The CPK elevations in the axSpA \n\n\n\n46 \n\nstudy were mostly mild to moderate, transient in nature and of unknown clinical significance with no \ncases leading to withdrawal. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. Multiple doses of up to 800 mg \nsubcutaneously and 20 mg/kg intravenously have been administered. In cases of overdose, it is \nrecommended that patients are monitored closely for any adverse reactions or effect, and appropriate \nsymptomatic treatment initiated immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nCimzia has a high affinity for human TNF\u03b1 and binds with a dissociation constant (KD) of 90 pM. \nTNF\u03b1 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine with a central role in inflammatory processes. Cimzia \nselectively neutralises TNF\u03b1 (IC90 of 4 ng/ml for inhibition of human TNF\u03b1 in the in vitro \nL929 murine fibrosarcoma cytotoxicity assay) but does not neutralise lymphotoxin \u03b1 (TNF\u03b2).  \n \nCimzia was shown to neutralise membrane associated and soluble human TNF\u03b1 in a dose-dependent \nmanner. Incubation of monocytes with Cimzia resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 production in human monocytes. \n \nCimzia does not contain a fragment crystallisable (Fc) region, which is normally present in a complete \nantibody, and therefore does not fix complement or cause antibody-dependent cell-mediated \ncytotoxicity in vitro. It does not induce apoptosis in vitro in human peripheral blood-derived \nmonocytes or lymphocytes, or neutrophil degranulation. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia have been assessed in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-\nblind clinical trials in patients \u2265 18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according \nto American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, RA-I (RAPID 1) and RA-II (RAPID 2). \nPatients had \u2265 9 swollen and tender joints each and had active RA for at least 6 months prior to \nbaseline. Cimzia was administered subcutaneously in combination with oral MTX for a minimum \nof 6 months with stable doses of at least 10 mg weekly for 2 months in both trials. There is no \nexperience with Cimzia in combination with DMARDs other than MTX. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia was assessed in DMARD-na\u00efve adult patients with active RA in a \nrandomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial (C-EARLY). In the C-EARLY trial patients \nwere \u2265 18 years of age and had \u2265 4 swollen and tender joints each and must have been diagnosed with \nmoderate to severe active and progressive RA within 1 year (as defined by the 2010 ACR/European \nLeague Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria). Patients had a mean time since \ndiagnosis at baseline of 2.9 months and were DMARD na\u00efve (including MTX). For both the Cimzia \n\n\n\n47 \n\nand placebo arms, MTX was initiated as of Week 0 (10 mg/week), titrated up to maximum tolerated \ndose by Week 8 (min 15 mg/week, max 25 mg/week allowed), and maintained throughout the study \n(average dose of MTX after Week 8 for placebo and Cimzia was 22.3 mg/week and 21.1 mg/week \nrespectively). \n \nTable 2 Clinical trial description \n\nStudy \nnumber \n\nPatient \nnumbers \n\nActive dose regimen Study objectives \n \n\nRA-I \n(52 weeks) \n\n982 400 mg (0,2,4 weeks) \nwith MTX \n\n200 mg or 400 mg \nevery 2 weeks with MTX \n\nEvaluation for treatment of signs and \nsymptoms and inhibition of structural damage.  \nCo-primary endpoints: ACR 20 at Week 24 and \n\nchange from baseline in mTSS at Week 52 \nRA-II \n\n(24 weeks) \n619 400 mg (0,2,4 weeks) \n\nwith MTX \n200 mg or 400 mg \nevery 2 weeks with \n\nMTX \n\nEvaluation for treatment of signs and \nsymptoms and inhibition of structural damage. \n\nPrimary endpoint: ACR 20 at Week 24.  \n\nC-EARLY \n(to 52 wee\n\nks) \n\n879 400 mg (0,2,4 weeks) \nwith MTX \n\n200 mg every 2 weeks \nwith MTX \n\nEvaluation for treatment of signs and \nsymptoms and inhibition of structural damage \n\nin DMARD na\u00efve patients.  \nPrimary endpoint: proportion of subjects in \n\nsustained remission* at Week 52 \nmTSS: modified Total Sharp Score \n*Sustained remission at Week 52 is defined as DAS28[ESR] <2.6 at both Week 40 and Week 52. \n \nSigns and symptoms \nThe results of clinical trials RA-I and RA-II are shown in Table 3. Statistically significantly greater \nACR 20 and ACR 50 responses were achieved from Week 1 and Week 2, respectively, in both clinical \ntrials compared to placebo. Responses were maintained through Weeks 52 (RA-I) and 24 (RA-II). Of \nthe 783 patients initially randomised to active treatment in RA-I, 508 completed 52 weeks of placebo-\ncontrolled treatment and entered the open-label extension study. Of these, 427 completed 2 years of \nopen-label follow-up and thus had a total exposure to Cimzia of 148 weeks overall. The observed \nACR 20 response rate at this timepoint was 91%.The reduction (RA-I) from Baseline in DAS28 (ESR) \nalso was significantly greater (p<0.001) at Week 52 (RA-I) and Week 24 (RA-II) compared to placebo \nand maintained through 2 years in the open-label extension trial to RA-I. \n \nTable 3 ACR response in clinical trials RA-I and RA-II \n\n Study RA-I \nMethotrexate combination \n\n(24 and 52 weeks) \n\nStudy RA-II \nMethotrexate combination \n\n(24 weeks) \nResponse Placebo + MTX \n\n \nN=199 \n\nCimzia  \n200 mg + MTX \nevery 2 weeks \n\n \nN=393 \n\nPlacebo + MTX \n \n\nN=127 \n\nCimzia  \n200 mg + MTX \nevery 2 weeks \n\n \nN=246 \n\nACR 20     \nWeek 24 14% 59%** 9% 57%** \nWeek 52 13% 53%** N/A N/A \nACR 50     \nWeek 24 8% 37%** 3% 33%** \nWeek 52 8% 38%** N/A N/A \nACR 70     \nWeek 24 3% 21%** 1% 16%* \nWeek 52 4% 21%** N/A N/A \n\n\n\n48 \n\nMajor \nClinical \nResponsea. \n\n1% 13%**   \n\nCimzia vs. placebo: *p\u22640.01, ** p<0.001 \na.

Assessments on remission (DAS28(ESR) <2.6), Low Disease \nActivity (DAS28(ESR) \u22643.2) status, ACR50 and ACR 70 by visit demonstrated that Cimzia+MTX \ntreatment led to faster and greater responses than PBO+MTX treatment. These results were maintained \nover 52 weeks of treatment in DMARD-na\u00efve subjects.  \n \nRadiographic response \nIn RA-I, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in mTSS and \nits components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing (JSN) score, at Week 52, compared to \nbaseline. Cimzia patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving placebo at Week 24 and Week 52 (see Table 5). In the placebo group, 52% of patients \nexperienced no radiographic progression (mTSS \u2264 0.0) at Week 52 compared to 69% in the \nCimzia 200 mg treatment group. \n \nTable 5 Changes over 12 months in RA-I \n\n Placebo + MTX \nN=199 \n\nMean (SD) \n\nCimzia 200 mg + MTX \nN=393 \n\nMean (SD) \n\nCimzia 200 mg + MTX \u2013 \nPlacebo + MTX \nMean Difference \n\nmTSS    \nWeek 52 2.8 (7.8) 0.4 (5.7) -2.4 \nErosion Score    \nWeek 52 1.5 (4.3) 0.1 (2.5) -1.4 \nJSN Score    \nWeek 52 1.4 (5.0) 0.4 (4.2) -1.0 \np-values were < 0.001 for both mTSS and erosion score and \u2264 0.01 for JSN score.

In both clinical trials, Cimzia-treated patients reported significantly \ngreater improvements in the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summaries and all domain scores. \nImprovements in physical function and HRQoL were maintained through 2 years in the open-label \nextension to RA-I. Cimzia-treated patients reported statistically significant improvements in the Work \nProductivity Survey compared to placebo. \n \nIn C-EARLY, Cimzia+MTX-treated patients reported significant improvements at Week 52 compared \nto placebo+MTX in pain as assessed by the Patient Assessment of Arthritis Pain (PAAP) \u2013 48,5 vs \n- 44,0 (least square mean) (p<0.05). \n \nDoseFlex clinical trial \nThe efficacy and safety of 2 dose regimens (200 mg every 2 weeks and 400 mg every 4 weeks) of \nCimzia versus placebo were assessed in an 18-week, open-label, run-in, and 16-week randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis \ndiagnosed according to the ACR criteria who had inadequate response to MTX. \n \nPatients received loading doses of Cimzia 400 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks during the initial open label period. Responders (achieved ACR 20) at week 16 were \nrandomised at week 18 to Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo in \ncombination with MTX for an additional 16 weeks (total trial length: 34 weeks). These 3 groups were \nwell balanced with regards to clinical response following the active run-in period (ACR 20: 83-84% at \nweek 18). \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was the ACR 20 responder rate at week 34. The results at \nweek 34 are shown in Table 7. Both Cimzia regimens showed sustained clinical response and were \n\n\n\n50 \n\nstatistically significant compared to placebo at week 34.

The axial spondyloarthritis overall \npopulation included subpopulations with and without (non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis [nr-\naxSpA]) radiographic evidence for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (also known as radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis). Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease \nActivity Index (BASDAI) \u2265 4, spinal pain \u2265 4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and \nincreased CRP or current evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Patients \nmust have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least one NSAID. Overall, 16% of \npatients had prior TNF-antagonist exposure. Patients were treated with a loading dose of \nCimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo followed by either 200 mg of \nCimzia every 2 weeks or 400 mg of Cimzia every 4 weeks or placebo. 87.7% of patients received \nconcomitant NSAIDs. The primary efficacy endpoint was the ASAS20 response rate at Week 12. \nThe 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of the study was followed by \na 24-week dose-blind treatment period, and a 156-week open-label treatment period. The maximum \nduration of the study was 204 weeks. All patients received Cimzia in both the dose-blind and open-\nlabel follow-up periods. A total of 199 subjects (61.2% of randomized subjects) completed the study \nthrough Week 204.  \n \nKey efficacy outcomes \nIn AS001 clinical trial, at Week 12 ASAS20 responses were achieved by 58% of patients receiving \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and 64% of patients receiving Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks as \ncompared to 38% of patients receiving placebo (p<0.01). In the overall population, the percentage of \nASAS20 responders was clinically relevant and significantly higher for the Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks and Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks treatment groups compared to placebo group at \nevery visit from Week 1 through Week 24 (p\u22640.001 at each visit). At Weeks 12 and 24, the percentage \nof subjects with an ASAS40 response was greater in the Cimzia-treated groups compared to placebo.  \nSimilar results were achieved in both the ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis subpopulations. In women, ASAS20 responses were not statistically significantly \ndifferent from placebo until after the Week 12 time point. \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nImprovements in ASAS5/6, Partial Remission and BASDAI-50 were statistically signficant at \nWeek 12 and Week 24 and were sustained up to Week 48 in the overall popualtion as well as in the \nsubpopulations. Key efficacy outcomes from the AS001 clinical trial are shown in Table -8.  \n \nAmong patients remaining in the study, improvements in all afore-mentioned key efficacy outcomes \nwere maintained through Week 204 in the overall population as well as in the subpopulations. \n \nTable 8 Key efficacy outcomes in AS001 clinical trial (percent of patients) \n\n \n \n\nParameters \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis Non-radiographic \naxial \n\nspondyloarthritits \n\n Axial \nspondyloarthritis \n\nOverall Population \n Placebo \n\nN=57 \nCimzia \n\nall dosing \nregimens(a) \n\nN=121 \n\nPlacebo \nN=50 \n\nCimzia all \ndosing \n\nregimens(a) \nN=97 \n\nPlacebo \nN=107 \n\n \n\nCimzia all \ndosing \n\nregimens(a) \nN=218 \n\nASAS20(b,c) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n37% \n33% \n\n \n60%* \n\n69%** \n\n \n40% \n24% \n\n \n61%* \n\n68%** \n\n \n38% \n29% \n\n \n61%** \n68%** \n\nASAS40(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n19% \n16% \n\n \n45%** \n53%** \n\n \n16% \n14% \n\n \n47%** \n51%** \n\n \n18% \n15% \n\n \n46%** \n52%** \n\nASAS 5/6(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n9% \n5% \n\n \n42%** \n40%** \n\n \n8% \n4% \n\n \n44%** \n45%** \n\n \n8% \n5% \n\n \n43%** \n42%** \n\nPartial remission(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n2% \n7% \n\n \n20%** \n28%** \n\n \n6% \n10% \n\n \n29%** \n33%** \n\n \n4% \n9% \n\n \n24%** \n30%** \n\nBASDAI 50(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n11% \n16% \n\n \n41%** \n49%** \n\n \n16% \n20% \n\n \n49%** \n57%** \n\n \n13% \n18% \n\n \n45%** \n52%** \n\n(a) Cimzia all dosing regimen = data from Cimzia 200 mg administered every 2 weeks preceded by a \nloading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 plus Cimzia 400 mg administered every 4 weeks preceded \nby a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n(b) Results are from the randomized set \n(c) Wald p-values are quoted for the comparison of treatments using logistic regression with factors for \ntreatment and region.  \n(d) Full Analysis Set  \nNA = not available \n*p\u22640.05, Cimzia vs placebo \n**p<0.001, Cimzia vs placebo \n\n \nSpinal mobility \nSpinal mobility was assessed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled period by using BASMI at \nseveral time points including Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. Clinically meaningful and statistically \nsignificant differences in Cimzia-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients were \ndemonstrated at each post-baseline visit. The difference from placebo tended to be greater in nr-axSpA \nthan in the AS subpopulation which may be due to less chronic structural damage in nr-axSpA \npatients. \nThe improvement in BASMI linear score achieved at Week 24 was maintained through Week 204 for \npatients who remained in the study. \n \nPhysical function response and health-related outcomes  \nIn the AS001 clinical trial, Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in physical \nfunction as assessed by the BASFI and in pain as assessed by the Total and Nocturnal Back Pain NRS \nscales as compared to placebo. Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in tiredness \n(fatigue) as reported by the BASDAI-fatigue item and in health-related quality of life as measured by \n\n\n\n52 \n\nthe ankylosing spondylitis QoL (ASQoL) and the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summaries \nand all domain scores as compared to placebo. Cimzia-treated patients reported significant \nimprovements in axial spondyloarthritis-related productivity at work and within household, as reported \nby the Work Productivity Survey as compared to placebo. For patients remaining in the study, \nimprovements in all afore-mentioned outcomes were largely maintained through Week 204. \n \nInhibition of inflammation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) \nIn an imaging sub-study including 153 patients, signs of inflammation were assessed by MRI at \nweek 12 and expressed as change from baseline in SPARCC (Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium \nof Canada) score for sacroiliac joints and ASspiMRI-a score in the Berlin modifications for the spine. \nAt week 12 significant inhibition of inflammatory signs in both sacroiliac joints and the spine was \nobserved in the Cimzia-treated patients (all dose group), in the overall axial spondyloarthritis \npopulation as well as in the sub-populations of ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis. Among patients remaining in the study, who had both baseline values and \nweek 204 values, inhibition of inflammatory signs in both the sacroiliac joints (n=72) and spine (n=82) \nwas largely maintained through Week 204 in the overall axial spondyloarthritis population as well as \nin both the AS and the nr-axSpA subpopulations. \n \n\nC-OPTIMISE \n\nThe efficacy and safety of dose reduction and treatment withdrawal in patients in sustained remission \nwere assessed in adult patients (18-45 years of age) with early active axSpA (symptom duration of less \nthan 5 years), an ASDAS score \u22652.1 (and similar disease inclusion criteria as in the AS001 study), and \nwho had inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs or an intolerance to or contraindication for \nNSAIDs. Patients included both the AS and nr-axSpA subpopulations of axSpA, and were enrolled \ninto an open-label run-in 48-Week period (Part A) during which they all received 3 loading doses of \nCimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks from Week 6 to Week \n46.   \n\nPatients who achieved sustained remission (defined as having inactive disease [ASDAS<1.3] over a \nperiod of at least 12 weeks) and remained in remission at week 48, were randomized into Part B and \nreceived either Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (N=104), Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks (dose \nreduction, N=105), or placebo (treatment withdrawal, N=104) for 48 Weeks.  \n\nThe primary efficacy variable was the percentage of patients who did not experience a flare during \nPart B. \n\nPatients who experienced a flare in Part B, ie, had an ASDAS \u22652.1 at 2 consecutive visits or \nASDAS >3.5 at any visit during Part B, received escape treatment of Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \nfor at least 12 weeks (with a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Week 0, 2 and 4 in placebo-treated \npatients).  \n\nClinical response \n\nThe percentage of patients who achieved sustained remission at Week 48 in Part A was 43.9% for the \noverall axSpA population, and was similar in the nr-axSpA (45.3%) and AS (42.8%) subpopulations. \n\nAmong the patients who were randomized in Part B (N=313), a statistically significant (p <0.001, NRI) \ngreater proportion of patients did not experience a flare when continuing treatment with Cimzia 200 \nmg every 2 weeks (83.7%) or Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks (79.0%) compared with treatment \nwithdrawal (20.2%).   \n\nThe difference in time to flare between the treatment withdrawal group and either of the Cimzia \ntreatment groups, was statistically significant (p<0.001 for each comparison) and clinically \nmeaningful. In the placebo group, flares started approximately 8 weeks after CIMZIA was withdrawn, \nwith the majority of flares occurring within 24 weeks of treatment withdrawal (Figure 1).  \n\n\n\n53 \n\nFigure 1   Kaplan-Meier curve of time to flare \n\n \nNon responder imputation (NRI) was used; Results are for the Randomized Set \nNote: Time to flare was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the flare.

Patients who \nwere in sustained remission at Week 48 had no or very low inflammation, and no meaningful increase \nin inflammation was observed at Week 96 irrespective of their treatment group. \n \nRetreatment in patients that experience a flare \nIn Part B, 70% (73/104) placebo-treated patients, 14% (15/105) patients treated with Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 4 weeks and 6.7% (7/104) patients treated with Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks experienced a flare \nand were subsequently treated with Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks.  \nAmong the 15 patients who flared in the group allocated to Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks, all patients \ncompleted 12 weeks of rescue therapy with Cimzia and had available ASDAS data, out of which 12 \n(80%) had ASDAS Low or Inactive disease (i.e. all ASDAS <2.1) after 12 weeks of restarting the open-\nlabel treatment. \nAmong the 73 patients who flared in the group allocated to treatment withdrawal, 71 patients completed \n12 weeks of rescue therapy with Cimzia and had available ASDAS data, out of which 64 (90%) had \nASDAS Low or Inactive disease (i.e. all ASDAS < 2.1) after 12 weeks of restarting the open-label \ntreatment.  \nBased on the results from C-OPTIMISE, a dose reduction in patients in sustained remission after one \nyear of treatment with Cimzia may be considered (see section 4.2). Withdrawal of Cimzia treatment is \nassociated with a high risk of flare. \n \nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in a 52 weeks multicenter, randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study (AS0006) in 317 patients \u226518 years of age with adult-onset axial \nspondyloarthritis and back pain for at least 12 months. Patients had to fulfil ASAS criteria for nr- \naxSpA (not including family history and good response to NSAIDs), and have had objective signs of \ninflammation indicated by C-reactive protein (CRP) levels above the upper limit of normal and/or \nsacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), indicative of inflammatory disease [positive CRP \n(> ULN) and/or positive MRI], but without definitive radiographic evidence of structural damage on \nsacroiliac joints. Patients had active disease as defined by the BASDAI \u22654, and spinal pain \u22654 on \na 0 to 10 NRS. Patients must have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least two \nNSAIDs. Patients were treated with placebo or a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at \nWeeks 0, 2 and 4 followed by 200 mg of Cimzia every 2 weeks. Utilization and dose adjustment of \nstandard of care medication (SC) (e.g., NSAIDs, DMARDs, corticosteroids, analgesics) were \npermitted at any time. The primary efficacy variable was the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity \nScore major improvement (ASDAS-MI) response at Week 52. ASDAS-MI response was defined as an \nASDAS reduction (improvement) \u2265 2.0 relative to baseline or as reaching the lowest possible score. \nASAS 40 was a secondary endpoint.  \nAt baseline, 37 % and 41% of patients had high disease activity (ASDAS \u22652.1, \u22643.5) and 62% \nand 58% of patient had very high disease activity (ASDAS >3.5) in the CIMZIA group and placebo \ngroup respectively.  \n \nClinical response \nStudy AS0006, performed in subjects without radiographic signs of inflammation in the SI joints, \nconfirmed the effect previously demonstrated in this subgroup in the AS001 study.  \nAt Week 52, a statistically significant greater proportion of patients treated with Cimzia achieved \nASDAS-MI response compared to patients treated with placebo. Cimzia-treated patients also had \nimprovements compared to placebo in multiple components of axial spondyloarthritis disease activity, \nincluding CRP. At both Week 12 and 52, ASAS 40 responses were significantly greater than placebo. \nKey results are presented in Table 10. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nTable 10: ASDAS-MI and ASAS 40 responses in AS0006 (percent of patients) \n \n\nParameters PlaceboN= 158 Cimzia\na 200 mg every 2 weeks \n\nN= 159 \nASDAS-MI  \nWeek 52 \n\n \n7% \n \n\n \n47%* \n\nASAS 40 \nWeek 12 \n \nWeek 52 \n\n \n11% \n \n16% \n\n \n48%* \n \n57%* \n\na Cimzia administered every 2 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n* p<0.001 \nAll percents reflect the proportion of patients who responded in the full analysis set.  \n \nAt Week 52, the percentage of patients achieving ASDAS inactive disease (ASDAS < 1.3) was 36.4 % \nfor the Cimzia group compared to 11.8 % for the placebo group. \n\n \nAt Week 52, patients treated with Cimzia showed a clinical meaningful improvement in the MASES \ncompared to placebo (LS mean change from baseline -2.4 ; -0.2 respectively).  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo \ncontrolled clinical trial (PsA001) in 409 patients \u2265 18 years of age with adult-onset active psoriatic \narthritis for at least 6 months as defined by the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis \n(CASPAR) criteria. Patients had \u2265 3 swollen and tender joints and increased acute phase reactants. \nPatients also had active psoriatic skin lesions or a documented history of psoriasis and had failed 1 or \nmore DMARDs. Previous treatment with one TNF-antagonist was allowed and 20% of patients had \nprior TNF-antagonist exposure. Patients received a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at \nWeeks 0, 2 and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo followed by either Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo every 2 weeks. Patients receiving concomitant \nNSAIDs and conventional DMARDs were 72.6% and 70.2% respectively. The two primary endpoints \nwere the percentage of patients achieving ACR 20 response at Week 12 and change from baseline in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 24. Efficacy and safety of Cimzia in patients with PsA \nwhose predominant symptoms were sacroiliitis or axial spondyloarthritis have not been separately \nanalysed. \nThe 24-week double-blind placebo controlled treatment period of the study was followed by \na 24-week dose-blind treatment period and an 168-week open-label treatment period. The maximum \nduration of the study was 216 weeks. All patients received Cimzia in both the dose-blind and open-\nlabel follow-up periods. A total of 264 subjects (64.5%) completed the study through Week 216. \n \nACR response \nCimzia-treated patients had a statistically significant higher ACR 20 response rate at Week 12 and \nWeek 24 compared with placebo-treated patients (p<0.001). The percentage of ACR 20 responders \nwas clinically relevant for the Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks \ntreatment groups compared to placebo group at every visit after baseline through Week 24 (nominal \np\u22640.001 at each visit). Cimzia treated patients also had significant improvements in \nACR 50 and 70 response rates. At week 12 and 24 improvements in parameters of peripheral activity \ncharacteristic of psoriatic arthritis (e.g. number of swollen joints, number of painful/tender joints, \ndactylitis and enthesitis) were seen in the Cimzia-treated patients (nominal p-value p<0.01).  \n \nKey efficacy outcomes from the PsA001 clinical trial are shown in Table11. \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nTable 11: Key efficacy outcomes in PsA001 clinical trial (percent of patients) \nResponse Placebo \n\n \nN=136 \n\nCimzia(a)200 mg \nQ2W \nN=138 \n\nCimzia(b) 400 mg \nQ4W \nN=135 \n\nACR20 \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n24% \n24% \n\n \n58%** \n64%** \n\n \n52%** \n56%** \n\nACR50 \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n11% \n13% \n\n \n36%** \n44%** \n\n \n33%** \n40%** \n\nACR70 \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n3% \n4% \n\n \n25%** \n28%** \n\n \n13%* \n24%** \n\nResponse Placebo \n \n\nN=86 \n\nCimzia(a)200 mg \nQ2W \nN=90 \n\nCimzia(b) 400 mg \nQ4W \nN=76 \n\nPASI 75 (c) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \nWeek 48 \n\n \n14% \n15% \nN/A \n\n \n47%*** \n62%*** \n67% \n\n \n47%*** \n61%*** \n62% \n\n(a) Cimzia administered every 2 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n(b) Cimzia administered every 4 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n(c) In subjects with at least 3% psoriasis BSA at Baseline \n*p<0.01, Cimzia vs placebo \n**p<0.001, Cimzia vs placebo  \n***p<0.001(nominal), Cimzia vs placebo  \nResults are from the randomized set.Treatment Difference: Cimzia 200 mg-placebo, Cimzia 400 mg-  \nplacebo (and corresponding 95% CI and p-value) are estimated using a standard two-sided Wald \nasymptotic standard errors test. Non-responder Imputation (NRI) is used for patients who escaped \ntherapy or had missing data. \n\n \nAmong 273 patients initially randomised to Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 400 mg \nevery 4 weeks, 237 (86.8%) were still on this treatment at Week 48. Of the 138 patients randomised to \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, 92, 68 and 48 had an ACR 20/50/70 response, at Week 48, \nrespectively. Of the 135 patients randomised to Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks, 89, 62 and 41 patients \nhad an ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively.  \nAmong patients remaining in the study, ACR 20, 50 and 70 response rates were maintained through \nWeek 216. This was also the case for the other parameters of peripheral activity (e.g. number of \nswollen joints, number of painful/tender joints, dactylitis and enthesitis). \n \nRadiographic response \nIn PsA001 clinical trial, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically \nand expressed as the change in modified total Sharp score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion \nScore (ES) and Joint Space Narrowing score (JSN) at Week 24, compared to baseline. The mTSS \nScore was modified for psoriatic arthritis by addition of hand distal interphalangeal joints. Cimzia \ntreatment inhibited the radiographic progression compared with placebo treatment at Week 24 as \nmeasured by change from baseline in total mTSS Score (LS mean [\u00b1SE] score was 0.28 [\u00b10.07] in the \nplacebo group compared with 0.06 [\u00b10.06] in the Cimzia all doses group; p=0.007). Inhibition of \nradiographic progression was maintained with Cimzia treatment up to Week 48 in the subset of \npatients at higher risk of radiographic progression (patients with a Baseline mTSS score of > 6). \nInhibition of radiographic progression was further maintained up to Week 216 for the patients who \nremained in the study. \n \nPhysical function response and health-related outcomes \nIn PsA001 clinical trial, Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in physical \nfunction as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire \u2013 Disability Index (HAQ-DI), in pain as \n\n\n\n57 \n\nassessed by the PAAP and in tiredness (fatigue) as reported by the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) as \ncompared to placebo. Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in health-related \nquality of life as measured by the psoriatic arthritis QoL (PsAQoL) and the SF-36 Physical and Mental \nComponents and in psoriatic arthritis-related productivity at work and within household, as reported \nby the Work Productivity Survey compared to placebo. Improvements in all afore-mentioned \noutcomes were maintained through Week 216. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in two placebo-controlled studies (CIMPASI-1 and \nCIMPASI-2) and one placebo- and active-controlled study (CIMPACT) in patients \u226518 years of age \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months. Patients had a Psoriasis Area \nand Severity Index (PASI) score \u2265 12, body surface area (BSA) involvement of \u2265 10%, Physician \nGlobal Assessment (PGA) of \u2265 3, and were candidates for systemic therapy and/or phototherapy \nand/or chemophototherapy. Patients who were \u2018primary\u2019 non-responders on any prior biologic therapy \n(defined as no response within the first 12 weeks of treatment) were excluded from the phase III \nstudies (CIMPASI-1, CIMPASI-2 and CIMPACT). The efficacy and safety of Cimzia were evaluated \nversus etanercept in the CIMPACT study. \n \nIn studies CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 the co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of \npatients achieving PASI 75 and PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201calmost clear\u201d (with at least a 2-point reduction from \nbaseline) at Week 16. In the CIMPACT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of \npatients achieving PASI 75 at Week 12. PASI75 and PGA at Week 16 were key secondary endpoints. \nPASI 90 at Week 16 was a key secondary endpoint in all 3 studies.  \n \nCIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 evaluated 234 patients and 227 patients respectively. In both studies \npatients were randomized to receive placebo or Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (following a loading \ndose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4) or Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks. At week 16, patients \nrandomized to Cimzia who achieved a PASI 50 response continued to receive Cimzia up to \nWeek 48 at the same randomized dose. Patients originally randomized to placebo that achieved a \nPASI 50 response but not a PASI 75 response at Week 16 received Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \n(with a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 16, 18, and 20). Patients with an inadequate response \nat Week 16 (PASI 50 non-responders) were eligible to receive Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks in an \nopen-label manner for a maximum of 128 weeks.  \n \nThe CIMPACT study evaluated 559 patients. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, or \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (following a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4), or \nCimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks up to Week 16, or etanercept 50 mg twice weekly, up to Week 12. \nPatients originally randomized to Cimzia who achieved a PASI75 response at Week 16 were re-\nrandomized based on their original dosing schedule. Patients on Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks were \nre-randomized to Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo. Patient on \nCimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks were re-randomized to Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks, or placebo. Patients were evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner \nthrough Week 48. All subjects who did not achieve a PASI 75 response at Week 16 entered an escape \narm and received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks in an open-label manner for a maximum of 128 \nweeks. \n \nIn all three studies, the blinded 48-week maintenance period was followed by a 96-week open-label \ntreatment period for the patients who were PASI 50 responders at Week 48. All these patients, \nincluding those receiving Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, started the open-label period at Cimzia 200 \nmg every 2 weeks. \n \nPatients were predominantly men (64%) and Caucasian (94%), with a mean age of 45.7 years \n(18 to 80 years); of these, 7.2% were \u2265 65 years of age. Of the 850 patients randomized to receive \nplacebo or Cimzia in these placebo-controlled studies, 29% of patients were na\u00efve to prior systemic \ntherapy for the treatment of psoriasis. 47% had received prior phototherapy or chemophototherapy, \nand 30% had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Of the 850 patients, 14% \nhad received at least one TNF-antagonist, 13% had received an anti-IL-17, and 5% had received an \n\n\n\n58 \n\nanti-IL 12/ 23. Eighteen percent of patients reported a history of psoriatic arthritis at baseline. The \nmean PASI score at baseline was 20 and ranged from 12 to 69. The baseline PGA score ranged from \nmoderate (70%) to severe (30%). Mean baseline BSA was 25% and ranged from 10% to 96%. \n \n \nClinical response at Week 16 and 48 \nThe key results of CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 studies are presented in Table 12. \n \nTable 12  Clinical response in studies CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 at Week 16 and Week 48 \n Week 16 Week 48 \nCIMPASI-1 \n Placebo \n\n \nN=51 \n\nCimzia 200 mg \nQ2W a) \nN=95 \n\nCimzia 400 mg \nQ2W \nN=88 \n\nCimzia 200 mg \nQ2W \nN=95 \n\nCimzia 400 mg \nQ2W \nN=88 \n\nPGA clear or \nalmost clearb) \n\n4.2% 47.0%* 57.9%* 52.7% 69.5% \n\nPASI 75 6.5% 66.5%* 75.8%* 67.2% 87.1% \nPASI 90 0.4% 35.8%* 43.6%* 42.8% 60.2% \nCIMPASI-2 \n Placebo \n\n \nN=49 \n\nCimzia 200 mg \nQ2W a) \nN=91 \n\nCimzia 400 mg \nQ2W \nN=87 \n\nCimzia 200 mg \nQ2W \nN= 91 \n\nCimzia 400 mg \nQ2W \nN= 87 \n\nPGA clear or \nalmost clearb) \n\n2.0% 66.8%* 71.6%* 72.6% 66.6% \n\nPASI 75 11.6% 81.4%* 82.6%* 78.7% 81.3% \nPASI 90 4.5% 52.6%* 55.4%* 59.6% 62.0% \na) Cimzia 200 mg administered every 2 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Week 0, 2, 4. \nb) PGA 5 category scale.

Results are from \nthe Randomized Set. \n \nIn all 3 studies, the PASI 75 response rate was significantly greater for Cimzia compared to placebo \nstarting at Week 4. \n \nBoth doses of Cimzia demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo regardless of age, gender, body \nweight, BMI, psoriasis disease duration, previous treatment with systemic therapies and previous \ntreatment with biologics.  \n \nMaintenance of response  \nIn an integrated analysis of  CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2, among patients who were PASI 75 \nresponders at Week 16 and received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks (N=134 of 175 randomised \nsubjects) or Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (N=132 of 186 randomised subjects), the maintenance of \nresponse at Week 48 was 98.0% and 87.5%, respectively. Among patients who were PGA clear or \nalmost clear at Week 16 and received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks (N=103 of 175) or Cimzia 200 \nmg every 2 weeks (N=95 of 186), the maintenance of response at Week 48 was 85.9% and 84.3% \nrespectively. \n \nAfter an additional 96 weeks of open-label treatment (Week 144) the maintenance of response was \nevaluated. Twenty-one percent of all randomised subjects were lost to follow-up before Week 144. \nApproximately 27% of completer study subjects who entered the open-label treatment between weeks \n48 to 144 on Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks had their dose increased to Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks \nfor maintenance of response. In an analysis in which all patients with treatment failures were \nconsidered non-responders, the maintenance of response of the Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \ntreatment group for the respective endpoint, after an additional 96 weeks of open-label therapy, was \n84.5% for PASI 75 for study subjects who were responders at Week 16  and 78.4% for PGA clear or \nalmost clear. The maintenance of response of the Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks treatment group, who \nentered the open-label period at Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, was 84.7% for PASI 75 for study \nsubjects who were responders at Week 16 and 73.1% for PGA clear or almost clear.  \n \nThese response rates were based on a logistic regression model where missing data were imputed over \n48 or 144 weeks using multiple imputation (MCMC method) combined with NRI for treatment \nfailures.  \n \nIn the CIMPACT study, among PASI 75 responders at Week 16 who received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 \nweeks and were re-randomized to either Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 200 mg every 2 \nweeks, or placebo, there was a higher percentage of PASI 75 responders at Week 48 in the Cimzia \ngroups as compared to placebo (98.0%, 80.0%, and 36.0%, respectively). Among PASI75 responders \nat Week 16 who received Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and were re-randomized to either Cimzia 400 \nmg every 4 weeks, Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, or placebo, there was also a higher percentage of \nPASI 75 responders at Week 48 in the Cimzia groups as compared to placebo (88.6%, 79.5%, and \n45.5%, respectively). Non-responder imputation was used for missing data. \n \nQuality of life / Patient reported outcomes \n \nStatistically significant improvements at Week 16 (CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2) from baseline \ncompared to placebo were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). Mean \ndecreases (improvements) in DLQI from baseline ranged from -8.9 to -11.1 with Cimzia 200 mg every \n\n\n\n60 \n\n2 weeks, from -9.6 to -10.0 with Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, versus -2.9 to -3.3 for placebo at \nWeek 16.  \n \nIn addition, at Week 16, Cimzia treatment was associated with a greater proportion of patients \nachieving a DLQI score of  0 or 1 (Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, 45.5% and 50.6% respectively; \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, 47.4% and 46.2% respectively, versus placebo, 5.9% and 8.2% \nrespectively).  \n \nImprovements in DLQI score were sustained or slightly decreased through Week 144. \n \nCimzia-treated patients reported greater improvements compared to placebo in the Hospital Anxiety \nand Depression Scale (HADS)-D. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nThe data below reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for \nantibodies to certolizumab pegol in an ELISA and later in a more sensitive method, and are highly \ndependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.  The observed incidence of antibody \n(including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors, \nincluding assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample \ncollection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the \nincidence of antibodies to certolizumab pegol in the studies described below with the incidence of \nantibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nThe overall percentage of patients with antibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least 1 occasion \nwas 9.6% in RA placebo-controlled trials. Approximately one-third of antibody-positive patients had \nantibodies with neutralising activity in vitro. Patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressants \n(MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients not taking immunosuppressants at \nbaseline. Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and in some \npatients, reduced efficacy. \n \nIn 2 long-term (up to 5 years of exposure) open-label studies, the overall percentage of patients with \nantibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion was 13% (8.4% of the overall patients had \ntransient formation of antibodies and an additional 4.7% had persistent formation of antibodies to \nCimzia). The overall percentage of patients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of \ndrug plasma concentration was estimated to be 9.1%. Similar to the placebo-controlled studies, \nantibody positivity was associated with reduced efficacy in some patients. \n \nA pharmacodynamic model based on the Phase III trial data predicts that around 15% of the patients \ndevelop antibodies in 6 months at the recommended dose regimen (200 mg every 2 weeks following a \nloading dose) without MTX co-treatment. This number decreases with increasing doses of \nconcomitant MTX treatment. These data are reasonably in agreement with observed data. \n \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nThe overall percentage of patients with antibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion up to \nWeek 24 was 11.7% in the Phase III placebo-controlled trial in patients with psoriatic arthritis. \nAntibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration.  \nOver the course of the entire study (up to 4 years of exposure), the overall percentage of patients with \nantibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion was 17.3% (8.7% had transient formation and \nan additional 8.7% had persistent formation of antibodies to Cimzia). The overall percentage of \npatients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of drug plasma concentration was \nestimated to be 11.5%. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nPlaque psoriasis \nIn the Phase III placebo- and active-controlled studies, the percentages of patients who were positive \nfor antibodies to Cimzia on at least one occasion during treatment up to Week 48 were 8.3 % (22/265) \nand 19.2% (54/281) for the Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \nrespectively. In CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2, sixty patients were antibody positive, 27 of these \npatients were evaluable for neutralizing antibodies and tested positive. First occurrences of antibody \npositivity in the open-label treatment period were observed in 2.8% (19/668) of patients. Antibody \npositivity was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and in some patients with reduced \nefficacy. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nAS001 \nThe overall percentage of patients with antibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion up to \nWeek 24 was 4.4% in the AS001 phase III placebo-controlled trial in patients with axial \nspondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nsubpopulations). Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration. \n\nOver the course of the entire study (up to 192 weeks), the overall percentage of patients with \nantibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion was 9.6% (4.8% had transient formation and \nan additional 4.8% had persistent formation of antibodies to Cimzia). The overall percentage of \npatients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of drug plasma concentration was \nestimated to be 6.8%. \n \nAS0006 and C-OPTIMISE  \nA more sensitive and drug tolerant assay was used for the first time in the AS0006 study (and later \nalso in the C-OPTIMISE study), resulting in a greater proportion of samples having measurable \nantibodies to Cimzia and thus a greater incidence of patients being classed as antibody positive. In \nAS0006,  the overall incidence of patients who were antibody positive to Cimzia was 97% \n(248/255 patients) after up to 52 weeks of treatment. Only the highest titers were associated with \nreduced Cimzia plasma levels, however, no impact on efficacy was observed. Similar results in \nrelation to antibodies to Cimzia were seen in C-OPTIMISE. Results from C-OPTIMISE also indicated \nthat a reduction of the dose to Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks did not change immunogenicity \noutcomes. \n \nAbout 22% (54/248) of the patients in AS0006 who were anti-Cimzia antibody positive at any time, \nhad antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. The neutralizing status of antibodies in C-\nOPTIMISE was not assessed. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nCertolizumab pegol plasma concentrations were broadly dose-proportional. Pharmacokinetics \nobserved in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis were consistent with those seen in healthy \nsubjects. \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, peak plasma concentrations of certolizumab pegol were \nattained between 54 and 171 hours post-injection. Certolizumab pegol has a bioavailability (F) of \napproximately 80% (range 76% to 88%) following subcutaneous administration compared to \nintravenous administration. \n \nDistribution \nThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was estimated at 8.01 l in a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and at 4.71 l in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of \npatients with plaque psoriasis. \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \nPEGylation, the covalent attachment of PEG polymers to peptides, delays the elimination of these \nentities from the circulation by a variety of mechanisms, including decreased renal clearance, \ndecreased proteolysis, and decreased immunogenicity. Accordingly, certolizumab pegol is an antibody \nFab' fragment conjugated with PEG in order to extend the terminal plasma elimination half-life of the \nFab' to a value comparable with a whole antibody product. The terminal elimination phase half-life \n(t1/2) was approximately 14 days for all doses tested.  \n \nClearance following subcutaneous dosing was estimated to be 21.0 ml/h in a rheumatoid arthritis \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, with an inter-subject variability of 30.8% (CV) and an inter-\noccasion variability of 22.0%. When assessed using the previous ELISA method, the presence of \nantibodies to certolizumab pegol resulted in an approximately three-fold increase in clearance. \nCompared with a 70 kg person, clearance is 29% lower and 38% higher, respectively, in individual RA \npatients weighing 40 kg and 120 kg. The clearance following subcutaneous dosing in patients with \npsoriasis was 14 ml/h with an inter-subject variability of 22.2% (CV). \n \nThe Fab' fragment comprises protein compounds and is expected to be degraded to peptides and amino \nacids by proteolysis. The de-conjugated PEG component is rapidly eliminated from plasma and is to \nan unknown extent excreted renally. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nSpecific clinical trials have not been performed to assess the effect of renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol or its PEG fraction. However, population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis based on subjects with mild renal impairment showed no effect of creatinine clearance. There \nare insufficient data to provide a dosing recommendation in moderate and severe renal impairment. \nThe pharmacokinetics of the PEG fraction of certolizumab pegol are expected to be dependent on \nrenal function but have not been assessed in patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nSpecific clinical trials have not been performed to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) \nSpecific clinical trials have not been performed in elderly patients subjects. However, no effect of age \nwas observed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in \nwhich 78 subjects (13.2% of the population) were aged 65 or greater and the oldest subject was \naged 83 years. No effect of age was observed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in adult \npatients with plaque psoriasis. \n \nGender \nThere was no effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol. As clearance decreases \nwith decreasing body weight, females may generally obtain somewhat higher systemic exposure of \ncertolizumab pegol. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nOn the basis of Phase II and Phase III clinical trial data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a \npopulation exposure-response relationship was established between average plasma concentration of \ncertolizumab pegol during a dosing interval (Cavg) and efficacy (ACR 20 responder definition). The \ntypical Cavg that produces half the maximum probability of ACR 20 response (EC50) was 17 \u00b5g/ml \n(95% CI: 10-23 \u00b5g/ml). Similarly, on the basis of Phase III clinical trial data in patients with psoriasis, \na population exposure-response relationship was established between plasma concentration of \ncertolizumab pegol and PASI with an EC90 of 11.1 \u00b5g/ml. \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe pivotal non-clinical safety studies were conducted in the cynomolgus monkey. In rats and \nmonkeys, at doses higher than those given to humans, histopathology revealed cellular vacuolation, \npresent mainly in macrophages, in a number of organs (lymph nodes, injection sites, spleen, adrenal, \nuterine, cervix, choroid plexus of the brain, and in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus). It is likely \nthat this finding was caused by cellular uptake of the PEG moiety. In vitro functional studies of human \nvacuolated macrophages indicated all functions tested were retained. Studies in rats indicated that \n> 90% of the administered PEG was eliminated in 3 months following a single dose, with the urine \nbeing the main route of excretion. \n \nCertolizumab pegol does not cross-react with rodent TNF. Therefore, reproductive toxicology studies \nhave been performed with a homologous reagent recognising rat TNF. The value of these data to the \nevaluation of human risk may be limited. No adverse effects were seen on maternal well-being or \nfemale fertility, embryo-foetal and peri- and post-natal reproductive indices in rats using a rodent anti-\nrat TNF\u03b1 PEGylated Fab' (cTN3 PF) following sustained TNF\u03b1 suppression. In male rats, reduced \nsperm motility and a trend of reduced sperm count were observed. \n \nDistribution studies have demonstrated that placental and milk transfer of cTN3 PF to the foetal and \nneonatal circulation is negligible. Certolizumab pegol does not bind to the human neonatal Fc receptor \n(FcRn). Data from a human closed-circuit placental transfer model ex vivo suggest low or negligible \ntransfer to the foetal compartment. In addition, experiments of FcRn-mediated transcytosis in cells \ntransfected with human FcRn showed negligible transfer (see section 4.6).  \n \nNo mutagenic or clastogenic effects were demonstrated in preclinical studies. Carcinogenicity studies \nhave not been performed with certolizumab pegol. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nCimzia, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for: \n\uf0b7 the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including MTX, has been \ninadequate. Cimzia can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when \ncontinued treatment with MTX is inappropriate \n\n \n\uf0b7 the treatment of severe, active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or \n\nother DMARDs. \n \nCimzia has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by  \nX-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with MTX. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nCimzia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe active axial spondyloarthritis, \ncomprising:  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) (also known as radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \nAdults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to, or are \nintolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n\n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS (also known as non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis) \nAdults with severe active axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS but with \nobjective signs of inflammation by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and /or magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI), who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to NSAIDs. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \nCimzia, in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults \nwhen the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nCimzia can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy. \n \nFor details on therapeutic effects, see section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of conditions for which Cimzia is indicated. Patients should be given the special reminder \ncard. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis \n \nLoading dose \nThe recommended starting dose of Cimzia for adult patients is 400 mg (given \nas 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) at weeks 0, 2 and 4. For rheumatoid arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis, MTX should be continued during treatment with Cimzia where appropriate. \n \nMaintenance dose \nRheumatoid arthritis \nAfter the starting dose, the recommended maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis is 200 mg every 2 weeks. Once clinical response is confirmed, an alternative \nmaintenance dosing of 400 mg every 4 weeks can be considered. MTX should be continued during \ntreatment with Cimzia where appropriate. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nAfter the starting dose, the recommended maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with axial \nspondyloarthritis is 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks. After at least 1 year of treatment \nwith Cimzia, in patients with sustained remission, a reduced maintenance dose of 200 mg every 4 \nweeks may be considered (see section 5.1). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nAfter the starting dose, the recommended maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with psoriatic \narthritis is 200 mg every 2 weeks. Once clinical response is confirmed, an alternative maintenance \ndosing of 400 mg every 4 weeks can be considered. MTX should be continued during treatment with \nCimzia where appropriate. \n \nFor the above indications, available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who \nshow no evidence of therapeutic benefit within the first 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nAfter the starting dose, the maintenance dose of Cimzia for adult patients with plaque psoriasis \nis 200 mg every 2 weeks. A dose of 400 mg every 2 weeks can be considered in patients with \ninsufficient response (see section 5.1). \n  \nAvailable data in adults with plaque psoriasis suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved \nwithin 16 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who \nshow no evidence of therapeutic benefit within the first 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with an \ninitial partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nMissed dose \nPatients who miss a dose should be advised to inject the next dose of Cimzia as soon as they \nremember and then continue injecting subsequent doses as instructed. \n \nSpecial populations \nPaediatric population (< 18 years old) \nThe safety and efficacy of Cimzia in children and adolescents below age 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) \nNo dose adjustment is required. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed no effect of age (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nCimzia has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \nThe total content (1 ml) of the dose-dispenser cartridge should be administered using the \nelectromechanical injection device ava for a subcutaneous injection only. Suitable sites for injection \nwould include the thigh or abdomen. \n \nCimzia solution for injection in a dose-dispenser cartridge is intended for single-use in conjunction \nwith the electromechanical injection device named ava. After proper training in the injection \ntechnique, patients may self-inject using the electromechanical injection device ava with the single-use \ndose-dispenser cartridge if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up \nas necessary. The physician should discuss with the patient which injection presentation option is the \nmost appropriate.  \n \nThe ava injection device currently does not support administration of a maintenance dose of 400 mg \nevery 2 weeks (plaque psoriasis) or a reduced maintenance dose of 200 mg every 4 weeks (axial \nspondyloarthritis); for patients receiving these maintenance doses, the physician is advised to use other \npresentations. \n \nFor administration, the instructions for use at the end of the package leaflet and in the user manual \nprovided with the electromechanical injection device ava should be followed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis or opportunistic infections (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA classes III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \nPatients must be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of infections including tuberculosis before, \nduring and after treatment with Cimzia. Because the elimination of certolizumab pegol may take up \nto 5 months, monitoring should be continued throughout this period (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nTreatment with Cimzia must not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection, \nincluding chronic or localised infections, until the infection is controlled (see section 4.3).  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Cimzia should be monitored \nclosely. Administration of Cimzia should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection \nuntil the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of \nCimzia in patients with a history of recurring or opportunistic infection or with underlying conditions \nwhich may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive \nmedications. \n \nPatients with rheumatoid arthritis may not manifest typical symptoms of infection, including fever, \ndue to their disease and concomitant medicinal products. Therefore, early detection of any infection, \nparticularly atypical clinical presentations of a serious infection, is critical to minimise delays in \ndiagnosis and initiation of treatment. \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis and tuberculosis (including miliary, disseminated and \nextrapulmonary disease), and opportunistic infections (e.g. histoplasmosis, nocardia, candidiasis) have \nbeen reported in patients receiving Cimzia. Some of these events have been fatal. \n \nTuberculosis \nBefore initiation of therapy with Cimzia, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(latent) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history for patients \nwith a personal history of tuberculosis, with possible previous exposure to others with active \ntuberculosis, and with previous and/or current use of immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate \nscreening tests, e.g. tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, should be performed in all patients (local \nrecommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in \nthe patient's reminder card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test \nresults, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed prior to or during treatment, Cimzia therapy must not be initiated \nand must be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n \nIf inactive (\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of \ntuberculosis should be consulted. In all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of Cimzia \ntherapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy must be started before \ninitiating treatment with Cimzia and in accordance with local recommendations.  \nUse of anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered before the initiation of Cimzia in patients \nwith a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be \nconfirmed, and in patients who have significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \nlatent tuberculosis. Biological tests for tuberculosis screening should be considered before starting \nCimzia treatment if there is any potential latent tuberculosis infection, regardless of BCG vaccination. \n \nDespite previous or concomitant prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of active tuberculosis \nhave occurred in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including Cimzia. Some patients who have \nbeen successfully treated for active tuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated \nwith Cimzia. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g. persistent cough, \nwasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during \nor after therapy with Cimzia. \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including certolizumab \npegol, who are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e., surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a \nfatal outcome.  \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Cimzia. For patients who \ntest positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended.  \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Cimzia should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Cimzia should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nThe potential role of TNF-antagonist therapy in the development of malignancies is not known. \nCaution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of \nmalignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop malignancy.  \n \nWith the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other \nmalignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n \nIn clinical trials with Cimzia and other TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma and other \nmalignancies have been reported among patients receiving TNF-antagonists than in control patients \nreceiving placebo (see section 4.8). In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. \n \nNo trials have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy, or that continue \ntreatment in patients who develop malignancy, while receiving Cimzia.  \n \nSkin cancers \nMelanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists \nincluding certolizumab pegol (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended, \nparticularly for patients with risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nPaediatric malignancy \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up \nto 22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age) in the post \nmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a \nvariety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated \nwith TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), have been reported in patients \ntreated with TNF-antagonists. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course \nand is usually fatal. The majority of reported TNF-antagonist cases occurred in adolescent and young \nadult males with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. Almost all of these patients had received \ntreatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine and/or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a \nTNF-antagonist at or prior to diagnosis. A risk for development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in \npatients treated with Cimzia cannot be excluded. \n \nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \n\n\n\n70 \n\nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \nCongestive heart failure \nCimzia is contraindicated in moderate or severe heart failure (see section 4.3). In a clinical trial with \nanother TNF-antagonist, worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality due to congestive \nheart failure have been observed. Cases of congestive heart failure have also been reported in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients receiving Cimzia. Cimzia should be used with caution in patients with \nmild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Treatment with Cimzia must be discontinued in patients who \ndevelop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n \nHaematological reactions \nReports of pancytopaenia, including aplastic anaemia, have been rare with TNF-antagonists. Adverse \nreactions of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopaenia (e.g. leukopaenia, \npancytopaenia, thrombocytopaenia) have been reported with Cimzia (see section 4.8). All patients \nshould be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive \nof blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Cimzia. \nDiscontinuation of Cimzia therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant \nhaematological abnormalities. \n \nNeurological events \nUse of TNF-antagonists has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical \nsymptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis. In \npatients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disorders, the benefits and risks of \nTNF-antagonist treatment should be carefully considered before initiation of Cimzia therapy. Rare \ncases of neurological disorders, including seizure disorder, neuritis and peripheral neuropathy, have \nbeen reported in patients treated with Cimzia. \n \nHypersensitivity \nSevere hypersensitivity reactions have been reported rarely following Cimzia administration. Some of \nthese reactions occurred after the first administration of Cimzia. If severe reactions occur, \nadministration of Cimzia should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted.  \n \nThere are limited data on the use of Cimzia in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity \nreaction towards another TNF-antagonist; in these patients caution is needed. \n \nLatex-sensitivity  \nThe needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA dose-dispenser cartridge contains a \nderivative of natural rubber latex (see section 6.5). Contact with natural rubber latex may cause severe \nallergic reactions in individuals sensitive to latex. No antigenic latex protein has to date been detected \nin the removable needle cap of the Cimzia dose-dispenser cartridge. Nevertheless, a potential risk of \nhypersensitivity reactions cannot be completely excluded in latex-sensitive individuals. \n \nImmunosuppression \nSince tumour necrosis factor (TNF) mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses, \nthe possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including Cimzia, to cause immunosupression, affecting \nhost defences against infections and malignancies. \n \nAutoimmunity \nTreatment with Cimzia may result in the formation of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and, \nuncommonly, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome (see section 4.8). The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Cimzia on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Cimzia, treatment must be \ndiscontinued. Cimzia has not been studied specifically in a lupus population (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n71 \n\nVaccinations \nPatients treated with Cimzia may receive vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available \non the response to live vaccinations or the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in \npatients receiving Cimzia. Live vaccines should not be administered concurrently with Cimzia. \n \nIn a placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, similar antibody response \nbetween Cimzia and placebo treatment were observed when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine \nand influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with Cimzia. Patients receiving Cimzia and \nconcomitant methotrexate had a lower humoral response compared with patients receiving Cimzia \nalone. The clinical significance of this is unknown.  \n \nConcomitant use with other biologics \nSevere infections and neutropaenia were reported in clinical trials with concurrent use of anakinra (an \ninterleukin-1 antagonist) or abatacept (a CD28 modulator) and another TNF-antagonist, etanercept, \nwith no added benefit compared to TNF-antagonist therapy alone. Because of the nature of the adverse \nevents seen with the combination of another TNF-antagonist with either abatacept or anakinra therapy, \nsimilar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra or abatacept and other \nTNF-antagonists. Therefore the use of certolizumab pegol in combination with anakinra or abatacept \nis not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nSurgery \nThere is limited safety experience with surgical procedures in patients treated with Cimzia. The 14-day \nhalf-life of certolizumab pegol should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. \nA patient who requires surgery while on Cimzia should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. \n \nActivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay \nInterference with certain coagulation assays has been detected in patients treated with Cimzia. Cimzia \nmay cause erroneously elevated aPTT assay results in patients without coagulation abnormalities. This \neffect has been observed with the PTT-Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) test and Standard Target Activated \nPartial Thromboplastin time (STA-PTT) Automate tests from Diagnostica Stago, and the HemosIL \nAPTT-SP liquid and HemosIL lyophilised silica tests from Instrumentation Laboratories. Other aPTT \nassays may be affected as well. There is no evidence that Cimzia therapy has an effect on coagulation \nin vivo. After patients receive Cimzia, careful attention should be given to interpretation of abnormal \ncoagulation results. Interference with thrombin time (TT) and prothrombin time (PT) assays have not \nbeen observed. \n \nElderly patients \nIn the clinical trials, there was an apparently higher incidence of infections among subjects \u2265 65 years \nof age, compared to younger subjects, although experience is limited. Caution should be exercised \nwhen treating the elderly patients, and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of \ninfections. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant treatment with methotrexate, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs) and analgesics showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetics analysis. \n \nThe combination of certolizumab pegol and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of Cimzia with methotrexate had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nmethotrexate. In study-to-study comparison, the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol appeared \nsimilar to those observed previously in healthy subjects. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \nThe use of adequate contraception should be considered for women of childbearing potential. For \nwomen planning pregnancy, continued contraception may be considered for 5 months after the last \nCimzia dose due to its elimination rate (see section 5.2), but the need for treatment of the woman \nshould also be taken into account (see below). \n \nPregnancy \nData from more than 500 prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to Cimzia with known \npregnancy outcomes, including more than 400 pregnancies exposed during the first trimester, does not \nindicate a malformative effect of Cimzia. However, the available clinical experience is too limited to, \nwith a reasonable certainty, conclude that there is no increased risk associated with Cimzia \nadministration during pregnancy. \n \nAnimal studies using a rodent anti-rat TNF\u03b1 did not reveal evidence of impaired fertility or harm to \nthe foetus. However, the value of these data may be limited these are insufficient with respect to \nhuman reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, Cimzia administered \nduring pregnancy could affect normal immune response in the newborn.  \n \nCimzia should only be used during pregnancy if clinically needed. \n \nNon-clinical studies suggest low or negligible level of placental transfer of a homologue Fab-fragment \nof certolizumab pegol (no Fc region) (see section 5.3). \n \nIn a clinical study 16 women were treated with certolizumab pegol (200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg \nevery 4 weeks) during pregnancy. Certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations measured in 14 infants at \nbirth were Below the Limit of Quantification (BLQ) in 13 samples; one was 0.042 \u00b5g/ml with an \ninfant/mother plasma ratio at birth of 0.09%. At Week 4 and Week 8, all infant concentrations were \nBLQ. The clinical significance of low levels certolizumab pegol for infants is unknown. It is \nrecommended to wait a minimum of 5 months following the mother\u2019s last Cimzia administration \nduring pregnancy before administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine), unless \nthe benefit of the vaccination clearly outweighs the theoretical risk of administration of live or live-\nattenuated vaccines to the infants. \n \nBreastfeeding \nIn a clinical study in 17 lactating women treated with Cimzia, minimal transfer of certolizumab pegol \nfrom the plasma to breast milk was observed. The percentage of the maternal certolizumab pegol dose \nreaching an infant during a 24 hour period was estimated to 0.04% to 0.30 %. In addition, since \ncertolizumab pegol is a protein that is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, \nthe absolute bioavailability is expected to be very low in a breastfed infant. \n \nConsequently, Cimzia can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nEffects on sperm motility measures and a trend of reduced sperm count in male rodents have been \nobserved with no apparent effect on fertility (see section 5.3).  \n \nIn a clinical trial to assess the effect of certolizumab pegol on semen quality parameters, 20 healthy \nmale subjects were randomized to receive a single subcutaneous dose of 400 mg of certolizumab pegol \nor placebo. During the 14-week follow-up, no treatment effects of certolizumab pegol were seen on \nsemen quality parameters compared to placebo. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCimzia may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness (including \nvertigo, vision disorder and fatigue) may occur following administration of Cimzia (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nCimzia was studied in 4,049 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in controlled and open label trials for \nup to 92 months.  \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies, patients receiving Cimzia had an approximately 4 times greater \nduration of exposure compared with the placebo group. This difference in exposure is primarily due to \npatients on placebo being more likely to withdraw early. In addition, Studies RA-I and RA-II had a \nmandatory withdrawal for non-responders at Week 16, the majority of whom were on placebo. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the controlled \ntrials was 4.4% for patients treated with Cimzia and 2.7% for patients treated with placebo. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions belonged to the system organ classes Infections and infestations, \nreported in 14.4% of patients on Cimzia and 8.0% of patients on placebo, General disorders and \nadministration site conditions, reported in 8.8% of patients on Cimzia and 7.4% of patients on placebo, \nand Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, reported in 7.0% of patients on Cimzia and 2.4% of \npatients on placebo. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nCimzia was initially studied in 325 patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing \nspondylitis and non-radiopraphic axial spondyloarthritis) in the AS001 clinical study for up to 4 years, \nwhich includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and \na 156-week open-label treatment period. Cimzia was subsequently studied in 317 patients with non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis in a placebo-controlled study for 52 weeks (AS0006). Cimzia was \nalso studied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in a clinical study for up to 96 weeks, which included a 48-week \nopen-label run-in phase (N=736) followed by a 48-week placebo-controlled phase (N=313) for \npatients in sustained remission (C-OPTIMISE). In all 3 studies, the safety profile for these patients \nwas consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous experience with Cimzia. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \nCimzia was studied in 409 patients with psoriatic arthritis in the PsA001 clinical study for up \nto 4 years which includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind \nperiod and a 168-week open-label treatment period. The safety profile for psoriatic arthritis patients \ntreated with Cimzia was consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous \nexperience with Cimzia. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia was studied in 1112 patients with psoriasis in controlled and open-label studies for up to 3 \nyears. In the Phase III program, the initial and maintenance periods were followed by a 96-week open-\nlabel treatment period (see section 5.1). The long-term safety profile of Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks \nand Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks was generally similar and consistent with previous experience with \nCimzia. \n \nDuring controlled clinical trials through Week 16, the proportion of patients with serious adverse \nevents was 3.5% for Cimzia and 3.7% for placebo.  \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events in the controlled clinical \nstudies was 1.5% for patients treated with Cimzia and 1.4% for patients treated with placebo.  \n \nThe most common adverse reactions reported through Week 16 belonged to the system organ classes \nInfections and infestations, reported in 6.1% of patients on Cimzia and 7% of patients on placebo, \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions, reported in 4.1% of patients on Cimzia and 2.3% \n\n\n\n74 \n\nof patients on placebo, and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, reported in 3.5% of patients on \nCimzia and 2.8% of patients on placebo. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions based primarily on experience from the placebo-controlled clinical trials and \npostmarketing cases at least possibly related to Cimzia are listed in Table 1 below, according to \nfrequency and system organ class. Frequency categories are defined as follows: Very common \n(\u2265 1/10); Common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1000); Very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

\nThe additional following adverse reactions have been observed uncommonly with Cimzia in other \nindications: gastrointestinal stenosis and obstructions, general physical health deterioration, abortion \nspontaneous and azoospermia. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections \nThe incidence rate of new cases of infections in placebo-controlled clinical trials in rheumatoid \narthritis was 1.03 per patient-year for all Cimzia-treated patients and 0.92 per patient-year for placebo-\ntreated patients. The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract \ninfections, and lower respiratory tract infections and herpes viral infections (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nIn the placebo-controlled clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis, there were more new cases of serious \ninfection in the Cimzia treatment groups (0.07 per patient-year; all doses), compared with placebo \n(0.02 per patient-year). The most frequent serious infections included pneumonia, tuberculosis \ninfections. Serious infections also included invasive opportunistic infections (e.g. pneumocystosis, \nfungal oesophagitis, nocardiosis and herpes zoster disseminated). There is no evidence of an increased \nrisk of infections with continued exposure over time (see section 4.4). \n \nThe incidence rate of new cases of infections in placebo-controlled clinical trials in psoriasis \nwas 1.37 per patient-year for all Cimzia-treated patients and 1.59 per patient-year for placebo-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections and viral infections \n(including herpes infections). The incidence of serious infections was 0.02 per patient-year in Cimzia \ntreated patients. No serious infections were reported in the placebo-treated patients. There is no \nevidence of an increased risk of infections with continued exposure over time. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nExcluding non-melanoma of the skin, 121 malignancies including 5 cases of lymphoma were observed \nin the Cimzia RA clinical trials in which a total of 4,049 patients were treated, representing 9,277 \npatient-years. Cases of lymphoma occurred at an incidence rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years and \nmelanoma at an incidence rate of 0.08 per 100 patient-years with Cimzia in rheumatoid arthritis \nclinical trials (see section 4.4). One case of lymphoma was also observed in the Phase III psoriatic \narthritis clinical trial. \n \nExcluding non-melanoma skin cancer, 11 malignancies including 1 case of lymphoma were observed \nin the Cimzia psoriasis clinical trials in which a total of 1112 patients were treated, representing 2300 \npatient-years. \n \nAutoimmunity \nIn the rheumatoid arthritis pivotal studies, for subjects who were ANA negative at baseline, 16.7% of \nthose treated with Cimzia developed positive ANA titers, compared with 12.0% of subjects in the \nplacebo group. For subjects who were anti-dsDNA antibody negative at baseline, 2.2% of those treated \nwith Cimzia developed positive anti-dsDNA antibody titers, compared with 1.0% of subjects in the \nplacebo group. In both placebo-controlled and open-label follow-up clinical trials for rheumatoid \narthritis, cases of lupus-like syndrome were reported uncommonly. There have been rare reports of \nother immune-mediated conditions; the causal relationship to Cimzia is not known. The impact of \nlong-term treatment with Cimzia on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. \n \nInjection site reactions \nIn the placebo-controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials, 5.8% of patients treated with Cimzia \ndeveloped injection site reactions such as erythema, itching, haematoma, pain, swelling or bruising, \ncompared to 4.8% of patients receiving placebo. Injection site pain was observed in 1.5% of patients \ntreated with Cimzia with no cases leading to withdrawal. \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nCreatine phosphokinase elevations \nThe frequency of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations was generally higher in patients with \naxSpA as compared to the RA population. The frequency was increased both in patients treated with \nplacebo (2.8% vs 0.4% in axSpA and RA populations, respectively) as well as in patients treated with \nCimzia (4.7% vs 0.8% in axSpA and RA populations, respectively). The CPK elevations in the axSpA \nstudy were mostly mild to moderate, transient in nature and of unknown clinical significance with no \ncases leading to withdrawal. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. Multiple doses of up to 800 mg \nsubcutaneously and 20 mg/kg intravenously have been administered. In cases of overdose, it is \nrecommended that patients are monitored closely for any adverse reactions or effect, and appropriate \nsymptomatic treatment initiated immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nCimzia has a high affinity for human TNF\u03b1 and binds with a dissociation constant (KD) of 90 pM. \nTNF\u03b1 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine with a central role in inflammatory processes. Cimzia \nselectively neutralises TNF\u03b1 (IC90 of 4 ng/ml for inhibition of human TNF\u03b1 in the in vitro \nL929 murine fibrosarcoma cytotoxicity assay) but does not neutralise lymphotoxin \u03b1 (TNF\u03b2).  \n \nCimzia was shown to neutralise membrane associated and soluble human TNF\u03b1 in a dose-dependent \nmanner. Incubation of monocytes with Cimzia resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 production in human monocytes. \n \nCimzia does not contain a fragment crystallisable (Fc) region, which is normally present in a complete \nantibody, and therefore does not fix complement or cause antibody-dependent cell-mediated \ncytotoxicity in vitro. It does not induce apoptosis in vitro in human peripheral blood-derived \nmonocytes or lymphocytes, or neutrophil degranulation. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia have been assessed in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-\nblind clinical trials in patients \u2265 18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according \nto American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, RA-I (RAPID 1) and RA-II (RAPID 2). \nPatients had \u2265 9 swollen and tender joints each and had active RA for at least 6 months prior to \nbaseline. Cimzia was administered subcutaneously in combination with oral MTX for a minimum \nof 6 months with stable doses of at least 10 mg weekly for 2 months in both trials. There is no \nexperience with Cimzia in combination with DMARDs other than MTX. \n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia was assessed in DMARD-na\u00efve adult patients with active RA in a \nrandomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial (C-EARLY). In the C-EARLY trial patients \nwere \u2265 18 years of age and had \u2265 4 swollen and tender joints each and must have been diagnosed with \nmoderate to severe active and progressive RA within 1 year (as defined by the 2010 ACR/European \nLeague Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria). Patients had a mean time since \ndiagnosis at baseline of 2.9 months and were DMARD na\u00efve (including MTX). For both the Cimzia \nand placebo arms, MTX was initiated as of Week 0 (10 mg/week), titrated up to maximum tolerated \ndose by Week 8 (min 15 mg/week, max 25 mg/week allowed), and maintained throughout the study \n(average dose of MTX after Week 8 for placebo and Cimzia was 22.3 mg/week and 21.1 mg/week \nrespectively). \n \nTable 2 Clinical trial description \n\nStudy \nnumber \n\nPatient \nnumbers \n\nActive dose regimen Study objectives \n \n\nRA-I \n(52 weeks) \n\n982 400 mg (0,2,4 weeks) \nwith MTX \n\n200 mg or 400 mg \nevery 2 weeks with MTX \n\nEvaluation for treatment of signs and \nsymptoms and inhibition of structural damage.  \nCo-primary endpoints: ACR 20 at Week 24 and \n\nchange from baseline in mTSS at Week 52 \nRA-II \n\n(24 weeks) \n619 400 mg (0,2,4 weeks) \n\nwith MTX \n200 mg or 400 mg \nevery 2 weeks with \n\nMTX \n\nEvaluation for treatment of signs and \nsymptoms and inhibition of structural damage. \n\nPrimary endpoint: ACR 20 at Week 24.  \n\nC-EARLY \n(to 52 wee\n\nks) \n\n879 400 mg (0,2,4 weeks) \nwith MTX \n\n200 mg every 2 weeks \nwith MTX \n\nEvaluation for treatment of signs and \nsymptoms and inhibition of structural damage \n\nin DMARD na\u00efve patients.  \nPrimary endpoint: proportion of subjects in \n\nsustained remission* at Week 52 \nmTSS: modified Total Sharp Score \n*Sustained remission at Week 52 is defined as DAS28[ESR] <2.6 at both Week 40 and Week 52. \n \nSigns and symptoms \nThe results of clinical trials RA-I and RA-II are shown in Table 3.

Assessments on remission (DAS28(ESR) <2.6), Low Disease \nActivity (DAS28(ESR) \u22643.2) status, ACR50 and ACR 70 by visit demonstrated that Cimzia+MTX \ntreatment led to faster and greater responses than PBO+MTX treatment. These results were maintained \nover 52 weeks of treatment in DMARD-na\u00efve subjects.  \n \nRadiographic response \nIn RA-I, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in mTSS and \nits components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing (JSN) score, at Week 52, compared to \nbaseline. Cimzia patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression than patients \nreceiving placebo at Week 24 and Week 52 (see Table 5). In the placebo group, 52% of patients \nexperienced no radiographic progression (mTSS \u2264 0.0) at Week 52 compared to 69% in the \nCimzia 200 mg treatment group. \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nTable 5 Changes over 12 months in RA-I \n Placebo + MTX \n\nN=199 \nMean (SD) \n\nCimzia 200 mg + MTX \nN=393 \n\nMean (SD) \n\nCimzia 200 mg + MTX \u2013 \nPlacebo + MTX \nMean Difference \n\nmTSS    \nWeek 52 2.8 (7.8) 0.4 (5.7) -2.4 \nErosion Score    \nWeek 52 1.5 (4.3) 0.1 (2.5) -1.4 \nJSN Score    \nWeek 52 1.4 (5.0) 0.4 (4.2) -1.0 \np-values were < 0.001 for both mTSS and erosion score and \u2264 0.01 for JSN score.

Sustained inhibition of \nprogression of structural damage was demonstrated in a subset of 449 of these patients who completed \nat least 2 years of treatment with Cimzia (RA-I and open-label extension study) and had evaluable data \nat the 2-year timepoint. \n \nIn C-EARLY, Cimzia+ MTX inhibited the radiographic progression compared to placebo+MTX at \nWeek 52 (see Table 6). In the placebo+MTX group, 49.7% of patients experienced no radiographic \nprogression (change in mTSS \u22640.5) at Week 52 compared to 70.3% in the Cimzia+MTX group \n(p<0.001). \n \nTable 6 Radiographic change at Week 52 in trial C-EARLY \n\n Placebo +MTX \nN= 163 \n\nMean (SD) \n\nCimzia 200 mg + MTX \nN = 528 \n\nMean (SD) \n\nCimzia 200 mg + MTX \u2013 \nPlacebo +MTX \n\nDifference* \nmTSS \nWeek 52 \n\n1.8 (4.3) 0.2 (3.2)** -0.978 (-1.005, -0.500) \n\nErosion score \nWeek 52 \n\n1.1 (3.0) 0.1 (2.1)** -0.500 (-0.508, -0.366) \n\nJSN score \nWeek 52 \n\n0.7 (2.3) 0.1 (1.7)** 0.000 (0.000, 0.000) \n\nRadiographic set with linear extrapolation. \n* Hodges-Lehmann point estimate of shift and 95% asymptotic (Moses) confidence interval. \n**Cimzia+MTX vs placebo+MTX p<0.001. p value was estimated from an ANCOVA model on the \nranks with treatment, region, time since RA diagnosis at Baseline (\u22644 months vs >4 months) as \nfactors and Baseline rank as a covariate. \n\n \nPhysical function response and health-related outcomes \nIn RA-I and RA-II, Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in physical function as \nassessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire \u2013 Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and in tiredness \n(fatigue) as reported by the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) from Week 1 through to the end of the \nstudies compared to placebo. In both clinical trials, Cimzia-treated patients reported significantly \ngreater improvements in the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summaries and all domain scores. \nImprovements in physical function and HRQoL were maintained through 2 years in the open-label \nextension to RA-I. Cimzia-treated patients reported statistically significant improvements in the Work \nProductivity Survey compared to placebo. \n \nIn C-EARLY, Cimzia+MTX-treated patients reported significant improvements at Week 52 compared \nto placebo+MTX in pain as assessed by the Patient Assessment of Arthritis Pain (PAAP) \u2013 48,5 vs \n- 44,0 (least square mean) (p<0.05). \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nDoseFlex clinical trial \nThe efficacy and safety of 2 dose regimens (200 mg every 2 weeks and 400 mg every 4 weeks) of \nCimzia versus placebo were assessed in an 18-week, open-label, run-in, and 16-week randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis \ndiagnosed according to the ACR criteria who had inadequate response to MTX. \n \nPatients received loading doses of Cimzia 400 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks during the initial open label period. Responders (achieved ACR 20) at week 16 were \nrandomised at week 18 to Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo in \ncombination with MTX for an additional 16 weeks (total trial length: 34 weeks). These 3 groups were \nwell balanced with regards to clinical response following the active run-in period (ACR 20: 83-84% at \nweek 18). \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was the ACR 20 responder rate at week 34. The results at \nweek 34 are shown in Table 7. Both Cimzia regimens showed sustained clinical response and were \nstatistically significant compared to placebo at week 34.

The axial spondyloarthritis overall \npopulation included subpopulations with and without (non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis [nr-\naxSpA]) radiographic evidence for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (also known as radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis). Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease \nActivity Index (BASDAI) \u2265 4, spinal pain \u2265 4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and \nincreased CRP or current evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Patients \nmust have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least one NSAID. Overall, 16% of \npatients had prior TNF-antagonist exposure. Patients were treated with a loading dose of \nCimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo followed by either 200 mg of \nCimzia every 2 weeks or 400 mg of Cimzia every 4 weeks or placebo. 87.7% of patients received \nconcomitant NSAIDs. The primary efficacy endpoint was the ASAS20 response rate at Week 12. \nThe 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of the study was followed by a 24-\nweek dose-blind treatment period, and a 156-week open-label treatment period. The maximum \nduration of the study was 204 weeks. All patients received Cimzia in both the dose-blind and open-\n\n\n\n82 \n\nlabel follow-up periods. A total of 199 subjects (61.2% of randomized subjects) completed the study \nthrough Week 204.  \n \nKey efficacy outcomes \nIn AS001 clinical trial, at Week 12 ASAS20 responses were achieved by 58% of patients receiving \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and 64% of patients receiving Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks as \ncompared to 38% of patients receiving placebo (p<0.01). In the overall population, the percentage of \nASAS20 responders was clinically relevant and significantly higher for the Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks and Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks treatment groups compared to placebo group at \nevery visit from Week 1 through Week 24 (p\u22640.001 at each visit). At Weeks 12 and 24, the percentage \nof subjects with an ASAS40 response was greater in the Cimzia-treated groups compared to placebo.  \n \nSimilar results were achieved in both the ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis subpopulations. In women, ASAS20 responses were not statistically significantly \ndifferent from placebo until after the Week 12 time point. \n \nImprovements in ASAS5/6, Partial Remission and BASDAI-50 were statistically signficant at \nWeek 12 and Week 24 and were sustained up to Week 48 in the overall popualtion as well as in the \nsubpopulations. Key efficacy outcomes from the AS001 clinical trial are shown in Table -8.  \n \nAmong patients remaining in the study, improvements in all afore-mentioned key efficacy outcomes \nwere maintained through Week 204 in the overall population as well as in the subpopulations. \n \nTable 8 Key efficacy outcomes in AS001 clinical trial (percent of patients) \n\n \n \n\nParameters \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis Non-radiographic \naxial \n\nspondyloarthritits \n\n Axial \nspondyloarthritis \n\nOverall Population \n Placebo \n\nN=57 \nCimzia \n\nall dosing \nregimens(a) \n\nN=121 \n\nPlacebo \nN=50 \n\nCimzia all \ndosing \n\nregimens(a) \nN=97 \n\nPlacebo \nN=107 \n\n \n\nCimzia all \ndosing \n\nregimens(a) \nN=218 \n\nASAS20(b,c) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n37% \n33% \n\n \n60%* \n\n69%** \n\n \n40% \n24% \n\n \n61%* \n\n68%** \n\n \n38% \n29% \n\n \n61%** \n68%** \n\nASAS40(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n19% \n16% \n\n \n45%** \n53%** \n\n \n16% \n14% \n\n \n47%** \n51%** \n\n \n18% \n15% \n\n \n46%** \n52%** \n\nASAS 5/6(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n9% \n5% \n\n \n42%** \n40%** \n\n \n8% \n4% \n\n \n44%** \n45%** \n\n \n8% \n5% \n\n \n43%** \n42%** \n\nPartial remission(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n2% \n7% \n\n \n20%** \n28%** \n\n \n6% \n10% \n\n \n29%** \n33%** \n\n \n4% \n9% \n\n \n24%** \n30%** \n\nBASDAI 50(c,d) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n11% \n16% \n\n \n41%** \n49%** \n\n \n16% \n20% \n\n \n49%** \n57%** \n\n \n13% \n18% \n\n \n45%** \n52%** \n\n(a) Cimzia all dosing regimen = data from Cimzia 200 mg administered every 2 weeks preceded by a \nloading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 plus Cimzia 400 mg administered every 4 weeks preceded \nby a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n(b) Results are from the randomized set \n(c) Wald p-values are quoted for the comparison of treatments using logistic regression with factors for \ntreatment and region.  \n(d) Full Analysis Set  \nNA = not available \n*p\u22640.05, Cimzia vs placebo \n**p<0.001, Cimzia vs placebo \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \nSpinal mobility \nSpinal mobility was assessed in the double-blind, placebo-controlled period by using BASMI at \nseveral time points including Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. Clinically meaningful and statistically \nsignificant differences in Cimzia-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients were \ndemonstrated at each post-baseline visit. The difference from placebo tended to be greater in nr-axSpA \nthan in the AS subpopulation which may be due to less chronic structural damage in nr-axSpA \npatients.  \nThe improvement in BASMI linear score achieved at Week 24 was maintained through Week 204 for \npatients who remained in the study. \n \nPhysical function response and health-related outcomes  \nIn the AS001 clinical trial, Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in physical \nfunction as assessed by the BASFI and in pain as assessed by the Total and Nocturnal Back Pain NRS \nscales as compared to placebo. Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in tiredness \n(fatigue) as reported by the BASDAI-fatigue item and in health-related quality of life as measured by \nthe ankylosing spondylitis QoL (ASQoL) and the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summaries \nand all domain scores as compared to placebo. Cimzia-treated patients reported significant \nimprovements in axial spondyloarthritis-related productivity at work and within household, as reported \nby the Work Productivity Survey as compared to placebo. For patients remaining in the study, \nimprovements in all afore-mentioned outcomes were largely maintained through Week 204. \n \nInhibition of inflammation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) \nIn an imaging sub-study including 153 patients, signs of inflammation were assessed by MRI at \nweek 12 and expressed as change from baseline in SPARCC (Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium \nof Canada) score for sacroiliac joints and ASspiMRI-a score in the Berlin modifications for the spine. \nAt week 12, significant inhibition of inflammatory signs in both sacroiliac joints and the spine was \nobserved in the Cimzia-treated patients (all dose group), in the overall axial spondyloarthritis \npopulation as well as in the sub-populations of ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis. \nAmong patients remaining in the study, who had both baseline values and week 204 values, inhibition \nof inflammatory signs in both the sacroiliac joints (n=72) and spine (n=82) was largely maintained \nthrough Week 204 in the overall axial spondyloarthritis population as well as in both the AS and the \nnr-axSpA subpopulations. \n \n\nC-OPTIMISE \n\nThe efficacy and safety of dose reduction and treatment withdrawal in patients in sustained remission \nwere assessed in adult patients (18-45 years of age) with early active axSpA (symptom duration of less \nthan 5 years), an ASDAS score \u22652.1 (and similar disease inclusion criteria as in the AS001 study), and \nwho had inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs or an intolerance to or contraindication for \nNSAIDs. Patients included both the AS and nr-axSpA subpopulations of axSpA, and were enrolled \ninto an open-label run-in 48-Week period (Part A) during which they all received 3 loading doses of \nCimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks from Week 6 to Week \n46.   \n\nPatients who achieved sustained remission (defined as having inactive disease [ASDAS<1.3] over a \nperiod of at least 12 weeks) and remained in remission at week 48, were randomized into Part B and \nreceived either Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (N=104), Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks (dose \nreduction, N=105), or placebo (treatment withdrawal, N=104) for 48 Weeks.  \n\nThe primary efficacy variable was the percentage of patients who did not experience a flare during \nPart B. \n\nPatients who experienced a flare in Part B, ie, had an ASDAS \u22652.1 at 2 consecutive visits or \nASDAS >3.5 at any visit during Part B, received escape treatment of Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \n\n\n\n84 \n\nfor at least 12 weeks (with a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Week 0, 2 and 4 in placebo-treated \npatients).  \n\nClinical response \n\nThe percentage of patients who achieved sustained remission at Week 48 in Part A was 43.9% for the \noverall axSpA population, and was similar in the nr-axSpA (45.3%) and AS (42.8%) subpopulations. \n\nAmong the patients who were randomized in Part B (N=313), a statistically significant (p <0.001, \nNRI) greater proportion of patients did not experience a flare when continuing treatment with \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (83.7%) or Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks (79.0%) compared with \ntreatment withdrawal (20.2%).   \n\nThe difference in time to flare between the treatment withdrawal group and either of the Cimzia \ntreatment groups, was statistically significant (p<0.001 for each comparison) and clinically \nmeaningful. In the placebo group, flares started approximately 8 weeks after Cimzia was withdrawn, \nwith the majority of flares occurring within 24 weeks of treatment withdrawal (Figure 1).  \n\nFigure 1  Kaplan-Meier curve of time to flare \n\n \nNon responder imputation (NRI) was used; Results are for the Randomized Set \nNote: Time to flare was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the flare. For study participants who did not have a  \nflare, the time to flare was censored at the date of Week 96 Visit. \nThe Kaplan-Meier plot was truncated to 97 weeks when <5% of participants were still remaining in the study. \n \n\nResults for Part B are presented in Table 9. \n\n \n\n\n\n85 \n\nTable 9  Maintenance of clinical response in Part B at Week 96  \n\nEndpoints \n\nPlacebo \n(treatment \n\nwithdrawal) \nN=104 \n\nCIMZIA 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks \n\nN=104 \n\nCIMZIA 200 mg  \n\nevery 4 weeks \nN=105 \n\nASDAS-MI, n (%)1  \nPart B Baseline (Week 48) 84 (80.8) 90 (86.5) 89 (84.8) \n\nWeek 96 11 (10.6) 70 (67.3)* 61 (58.1)* \n\nASAS40, n (%)1  \n\nPart B Baseline (Week 48) 101 (97.1) 103 (99.0) 101 (96.2) \n\nWeek 96 22 (21.2) 88 (84.6)* 77 (73.3)* \n\nBASDAI change from Part B \nbaseline (Week 48), LS mean (SE)2  \n\nWeek 96 3.02 (0.226) 0.56 (0.176)* 0.78 (0.176)* \n\nASDAS change from Part B \nbaseline (Week 48), LS mean (SE)2  \n\nWeek 96 1.66 (0.110) 0.24 (0.077)* 0.45 (0.077)* \n1 Non responder imputation (NRI) was used; Results are for the Randomized Set \n2 mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) was used; Results are for the Randomized Set \nASDAS-MI = Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-Major Improvement; ASAS: Assessment of Sponyloarthritis international \nSociety; ASAS40= ASAS40% response criteria; SE = Standard error;  \nNote: ASDAS major improvement is defined as a reduction from Baseline \u22652.0.  \nNote: Part A Baseline was used as a reference to define ASDAS clinical improvement variables and ASAS variables  \n* Nominal p<0.001, CIMZIA vs. placebo \n\n \n\nInhibition of inflammation in Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) \nIn Part B, signs of inflammation were assessed by MRI at Week 48 and at Week 96 and expressed as \nchange from baseline in SIJ SPARCC and ASspiMRI-a score in the Berlin modifications. Patients who \nwere in sustained remission at Week 48 had no or very low inflammation, and no meaningful increase \nin inflammation was observed at Week 96 irrespective of their treatment group. \n \nRetreatment in patients that experience a flare \nIn Part B, 70% (73/104) placebo-treated patients, 14% (15/105) patients treated with Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 4 weeks and 6.7% (7/104) patients treated with Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks experienced a flare \nand were subsequently treated with Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks.  \nAmong the 15 patients who flared in the group allocated to Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks, all patients \ncompleted 12 weeks of rescue therapy with Cimzia and had available ASDAS data, out of which 12 \n(80%) had ASDAS Low or Inactive disease (i.e. all ASDAS <2.1) after 12 weeks of restarting the open-\nlabel treatment. \nAmong the 73 patients who flared in the group allocated to treatment withdrawal, 71 patients completed \n12 weeks of rescue therapy with Cimzia and had available ASDAS data, out of which 64 (90%) had \nASDAS Low or Inactive disease (i.e. all ASDAS < 2.1) after 12 weeks of restarting the open-label \ntreatment. \nBased on the results from C-OPTIMISE, a dose reduction in patients in sustained remission after one \nyear of treatment with Cimzia may be considered (see section 4.2). Withdrawal of Cimzia treatment is \nassociated with a high risk of flare. \n \nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in a 52 weeks multicenter, randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study (AS0006) in 317 patients \u226518 years of age with adult-onset axial \n\n\n\n86 \n\nspondyloarthritis and back pain for at least 12 months. Patients had to fulfil ASAS criteria for nr- \naxSpA (not including family history and good response to NSAIDs), and have had objective signs of \ninflammation indicated by C-reactive protein (CRP) levels above the upper limit of normal and/or \nsacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), indicative of inflammatory disease [positive CRP \n(> ULN) and/or positive MRI], but without definitive radiographic evidence of structural damage on \nsacroiliac joints. Patients had active disease as defined by the BASDAI \u22654, and spinal pain \u22654 on \na 0 to 10 NRS. Patients must have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least two \nNSAIDs. Patients were treated with placebo or a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at \nWeeks 0, 2 and 4 followed by 200 mg of Cimzia every 2 weeks. Utilization and dose adjustment of \nstandard of care medication (SC) (e.g., NSAIDs, DMARDs, corticosteroids, analgesics) were \npermitted at any time. The primary efficacy variable was the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity \nScore major improvement (ASDAS-MI) response at Week 52. ASDAS-MI response was defined as an \nASDAS reduction (improvement) \u2265 2.0 relative to baseline or as reaching the lowest possible score. \nASAS 40 was a secondary endpoint.  \nAt baseline, 37 % and 41% of patients had high disease activity (ASDAS \u22652.1, \u22643.5) and 62% and \n58% of patient had very high disease activity (ASDAS >3.5) in the CIMZIA group and placebo group \nrespectively.  \n \nClinical response \nStudy AS0006, performed in subjects without radiographic signs of inflammation in the SI joints, \nconfirmed the effect previously demonstrated in this subgroup in the AS001 study.  \nAt Week 52, a statistically significant greater proportion of patients treated with Cimzia achieved \nASDAS-MI response compared to patients treated with placebo. Cimzia-treated patients also had \nimprovements compared to placebo in multiple components of axial spondyloarthritis disease activity, \nincluding CRP. At both Week 12 and 52, ASAS 40 responses were significantly greater than placebo. \nKey results are presented in Table 10. \n \nTable 10: ASDAS-MI and ASAS 40 responses in AS0006 (percent of patients) \n\n \n\nParameters Placebo N= 158 \nCimziaa 200 mg every 2 weeks \nN= 159 \n\nASDAS-MI  \nWeek 52 \n\n \n7% \n \n\n \n47%* \n\nASAS 40 \nWeek 12 \n \nWeek 52 \n\n \n11% \n \n16% \n\n \n48%* \n \n57%* \n\na Cimzia administered every 2 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n* p<0.001 \nAll percents reflect the proportion of patients who responded in the full analysis set.  \n\n \nAt Week 52, the percentage of patients achieving ASDAS inactive disease (ASDAS < 1.3) was 36.4 % \nfor the Cimzia group compared to 11.8 % for the placebo group. \n\n \nAt Week 52, patients treated with Cimzia showed a clinical meaningful improvement in the MASES \ncompared to placebo (LS mean change from baseline -2.4 ; -0.2 respectively).  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo \ncontrolled clinical trial (PsA001) in 409 patients \u2265 18 years of age with adult-onset active psoriatic \narthritis for at least 6 months as defined by the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis \n(CASPAR) criteria. Patients had \u2265 3 swollen and tender joints and increased acute phase reactants. \nPatients also had active psoriatic skin lesions or a documented history of psoriasis and had failed 1 or \nmore DMARDs. Previous treatment with one TNF-antagonist was allowed and 20% of patients had \nprior TNF-antagonist exposure. Patients received a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at \n\n\n\n87 \n\nWeeks 0, 2 and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo followed by either Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo every 2 weeks. Patients receiving concomitant \nNSAIDs and conventional DMARDs were 72.6% and 70.2% respectively. The two primary endpoints \nwere the percentage of patients achieving ACR 20 response at Week 12 and change from baseline in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 24. Efficacy and safety of Cimzia in patients with PsA \nwhose predominant symptoms were sacroiliitis or axial spondyloarthritis have not been separately \nanalysed. \nThe 24-week double-blind placebo controlled treatment period of the study was followed by a 24-\nweek dose-blind treatment period and an 168-week open-label treatment period. The maximum \nduration of the study was 216 weeks. All patients received Cimzia in both the dose-blind and open-\nlabel follow-up periods. A total of 264 subjects (64.5%) completed the study through Week 216. \n \nACR response \nCimzia-treated patients had a statistically significant higher ACR 20 response rate at Week 12 and \nWeek 24 compared with placebo-treated patients (p<0.001). The percentage of ACR 20 responders \nwas clinically relevant for the Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks \ntreatment groups compared to placebo group at every visit after baseline through Week 24 (nominal \np\u22640.001 at each visit). Cimzia treated patients also had significant improvements in \nACR 50 and 70 response rates. At week 12 and 24 improvements in parameters of peripheral activity \ncharacteristic of psoriatic arthritis (e.g. number of swollen joints, number of painful/tender joints, \ndactylitis and enthesitis) were seen in the Cimzia-treated patients (nominal p-value p<0.01).  \nKey efficacy outcomes from the PsA001 clinical trial are shown in Table 11. \n \nTable 11: Key efficacy outcomes in PsA001 clinical trial (percent of patients) \nResponse Placebo \n\n \nN=136 \n\nCimzia(a)200 mg \nQ2W \nN=138 \n\nCimzia(b) 400 mg \nQ4W \nN=135 \n\nACR20 \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n24% \n24% \n\n \n58%** \n64%** \n\n \n52%** \n56%** \n\nACR50 \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n11% \n13% \n\n \n36%** \n44%** \n\n \n33%** \n40%** \n\nACR70 \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \n\n \n3% \n4% \n\n \n25%** \n28%** \n\n \n13%* \n24%** \n\nResponse Placebo \n \n\nN=86 \n\nCimzia(a)200 mg \nQ2W \nN=90 \n\nCimzia(b) 400 mg \nQ4W \nN=76 \n\nPASI 75 (c) \nWeek 12 \nWeek 24 \nWeek 48 \n\n \n14% \n15% \nN/A \n\n \n47%*** \n62%*** \n67% \n\n \n47%*** \n61%*** \n62% \n\n(a) Cimzia administered every 2 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n(b) Cimzia administered every 4 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 \n(c) In subjects with at least 3% psoriasis BSA at Baseline \n*p<0.01, Cimzia vs placebo \n**p<0.001, Cimzia vs placebo  \n***p<0.001(nominal), Cimzia vs placebo  \nResults are from the randomized set.Treatment Difference: Cimzia 200 mg-placebo, Cimzia 400 mg-  \nplacebo (and corresponding 95% CI and p-value) are estimated using a standard two-sided Wald \nasymptotic standard errors test. Non-responder Imputation (NRI) is used for patients who escaped \ntherapy or had missing data. \n\n \nAmong 273 patients initially randomised to Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 400 mg \nevery 4 weeks, 237 (86.8%) were still on this treatment at Week 48. Of the 138 patients randomised to \n\n\n\n88 \n\nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, 92, 68 and 48 had an ACR 20/50/70 response, at Week 48 respectively. \nOf the 135 patients randomised to Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks, 89, 62 and 41 patients had an \nACR 20/50/70 response, respectively.  \nAmong patients remaining in the study, ACR 20, 50 and 70 response rates were maintained through \nWeek 216. This was also the case for the other parameters of peripheral activity (e.g. number of \nswollen joints, number of painful/tender joints, dactylitis and enthesitis). \n \nRadiographic response \nIn PsA001 clinical trial, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically \nand expressed as the change in modified total Sharp score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion \nScore (ES) and Joint Space Narrowing score (JSN) at Week 24, compared to baseline. The mTSS \nScore was modified for psoriatic arthritis by addition of hand distal interphalangeal joints. Cimzia \ntreatment inhibited the radiographic progression compared with placebo treatment at Week 24 as \nmeasured by change from baseline in total mTSS Score (LS mean [\u00b1SE] score was 0.28 [\u00b10.07] in the \nplacebo group compared with 0.06 [\u00b10.06] in the Cimzia all doses group; p=0.007). Inhibition of \nradiographic progression was maintained with Cimzia treatment up to Week 48 in the subset of \npatients at higher risk of radiographic progression (patients with a Baseline mTSS score of > 6). \nInhibition of radiographic progression was further maintained up to Week 216 for the patients who \nremained in the study. \n \nPhysical function response and health-related outcomes \nIn PsA001 clinical trial, Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in physical \nfunction as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire \u2013 Disability Index (HAQ-DI), in pain as \nassessed by the PAAP and in tiredness (fatigue) as reported by the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) as \ncompared to placebo. Cimzia-treated patients reported significant improvements in health-related \nquality of life as measured by the psoriatic arthritis QoL (PsAQoL) and the SF-36 Physical and Mental \nComponents and in psoriatic arthritis-related productivity at work and within household, as reported \nby the Work Productivity Survey compared to placebo. Improvements in all afore-mentioned \noutcomes were maintained through Week 216. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nThe efficacy and safety of Cimzia were assessed in two placebo-controlled studies (CIMPASI-1 and \nCIMPASI-2) and one placebo- and active-controlled study (CIMPACT) in patients \u226518 years of age \nwith moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months. Patients had a Psoriasis Area \nand Severity Index (PASI) score \u2265 12, body surface area (BSA) involvement of \u2265 10%, Physician \nGlobal Assessment (PGA) of \u2265 3, and were candidates for systemic therapy and/or phototherapy \nand/or chemophototherapy. Patients who were \u2018primary\u2019 non-responders on any prior biologic therapy \n(defined as no response within the first 12 weeks of treatment) were excluded from the phase III \nstudies (CIMPASI-1, CIMPASI-2 and CIMPACT). The efficacy and safety of Cimzia were evaluated \nversus etanercept in the CIMPACT study. \n \nIn studies CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 the co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of \npatients achieving PASI 75 and PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201calmost clear\u201d (with at least a 2-point reduction from \nbaseline) at Week 16. In the CIMPACT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of \npatients achieving PASI 75 at Week 12. PASI75 and PGA at Week 16 were key secondary endpoints. \nPASI 90 at Week 16 was a key secondary endpoint in all 3 studies.  \n \nCIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 evaluated 234 patients and 227 patients respectively. In both studies \npatients were randomized to receive placebo or Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (following a loading \ndose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4) or Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks. At week 16, patients \nrandomized to Cimzia who achieved a PASI 50 response continued to receive Cimzia up to \nWeek 48 at the same randomized dose. Patients originally randomized to placebo that achieved a \nPASI 50 response but not a PASI 75 response at Week 16 received Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \n(with a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 16, 18, and 20). Patients with an inadequate response \nat Week 16 (PASI 50 non-responders) were eligible to receive Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks in an \nopen-label manner for a maximum of 128 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n89 \n\nThe CIMPACT study evaluated 559 patients. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, or \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks (following a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4), or \nCimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks up to Week 16, or etanercept 50 mg twice weekly, up to Week 12. \nPatients originally randomized to Cimzia who achieved a PASI75 response at Week 16 were re-\nrandomized based on their original dosing schedule. Patients on Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks were \nre-randomized to Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo. Patient on \nCimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks were re-randomized to Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 200 mg \nevery 2 weeks, or placebo. Patients were evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner \nthrough Week 48. All subjects who did not achieve a PASI 75 response at Week 16 entered an escape \narm and received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks in an open-label manner for a maximum of 128 \nweeks. \n \nIn all three studies, the blinded 48-week maintenance period was followed by a 96-week open-label \ntreatment period for the patients who were PASI 50 responders at Week 48. All these patients, \nincluding those receiving Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, started the open-label period at Cimzia 200 \nmg every 2 weeks. \n \nPatients were predominantly men (64%) and Caucasian (94%), with a mean age of 45.7 years \n(18 to 80 years); of these, 7.2% were \u2265 65 years of age. Of the 850 patients randomized to receive \nplacebo or Cimzia in these placebo-controlled studies, 29% of patients were na\u00efve to prior systemic \ntherapy for the treatment of psoriasis. 47% had received prior phototherapy or chemophototherapy, \nand 30% had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Of the 850 patients, 14% \nhad received at least one TNF-antagonist, 13% had received an anti-IL-17, and 5% had received an \nanti-IL 12/ 23. Eighteen percent of patients reported a history of psoriatic arthritis at baseline. The \nmean PASI score at baseline was 20 and ranged from 12 to 69. The baseline PGA score ranged from \nmoderate (70%) to severe (30%). Mean baseline BSA was 25% and ranged from 10% to 96%. \n \nClinical response at Week 16 and 48 \nThe key results of CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 studies are presented in Table 12. \n \nTable 12: Clinical response in studies CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2 at Week 16 and Week 48 \n Week 16 Week 48 \nCIMPASI-1 \n Placebo \n\n \nN=51 \n\nCimzia 200 mg \nQ2W a) \nN=95 \n\nCimzia 400 mg \nQ2W \nN=88 \n\nCimzia 200 mg \nQ2W \nN=95 \n\nCimzia 400 mg \nQ2W \nN=88 \n\nPGA clear or \nalmost clearb) \n\n4.2% 47.0%* 57.9%* 52.7% 69.5% \n\nPASI 75 6.5% 66.5%* 75.8%* 67.2% 87.1% \nPASI 90 0.4% 35.8%* 43.6%* 42.8% 60.2% \nCIMPASI-2 \n Placebo \n\n \nN=49 \n\nCimzia 200 mg \nQ2W a) \nN=91 \n\nCimzia 400 mg \nQ2W \nN=87 \n\nCimzia 200 mg \nQ2W \nN= 91 \n\nCimzia 400 mg \nQ2W \nN= 87 \n\nPGA clear or \nalmost clearb) \n\n2.0% 66.8%* 71.6%* 72.6% 66.6% \n\nPASI 75 11.6% 81.4%* 82.6%* 78.7% 81.3% \nPASI 90 4.5% 52.6%* 55.4%* 59.6% 62.0% \na) Cimzia 200 mg administered every 2 weeks preceded by a loading dose of 400 mg at Week 0, 2, 4. \nb) PGA 5 category scale.

Twenty-one percent of all randomised subjects were lost to follow-up before Week 144. \nApproximately 27% of completer study subjects who entered the open-label treatment between weeks \n48 to 144 on Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks had their dose increased to Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks \nfor maintenance of response. In an analysis in which all patients with treatment failures were \nconsidered non-responders, the maintenance of response of the Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \ntreatment group for the respective endpoint, after an additional 96 weeks of open-label therapy, was \n84.5% for PASI 75 for study subjects who were responders at Week 16  and 78.4% for PGA clear or \nalmost clear. The maintenance of response of the Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks treatment group, who \nentered the open-label period at Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, was 84.7% for PASI 75 for study \nsubjects who were responders at Week 16 and 73.1% for PGA clear or almost clear.  \n \n\n\n\n91 \n\nThese response rates were based on a logistic regression model where missing data were imputed over \n48 or 144 weeks using multiple imputation (MCMC method) combined with NRI for treatment \nfailures.  \n \nIn the CIMPACT study, among PASI 75 responders at Week 16 who received Cimzia 400 mg every 2 \nweeks and were re-randomized to either Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, Cimzia 200 mg every 2 \nweeks, or placebo, there was a higher percentage of PASI 75 responders at Week 48 in the Cimzia \ngroups as compared to placebo (98.0%, 80.0%, and 36.0%, respectively). Among PASI75 responders \nat Week 16 who received Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks and were re-randomized to either Cimzia 400 \nmg every 4 weeks, Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, or placebo, there was also a higher percentage of \nPASI 75 responders at Week 48 in the Cimzia groups as compared to placebo (88.6%, 79.5%, and \n45.5%, respectively). Non-responder imputation was used for missing data. \n \nQuality of life / Patient reported outcomes \n \nStatistically significant improvements at Week 16 (CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2) from baseline \ncompared to placebo were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). Mean \ndecreases (improvements) in DLQI from baseline ranged from -8.9 to -11.1 with Cimzia 200 mg every \n2 weeks, from -9.6 to -10.0 with Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, versus -2.9 to -3.3 for placebo at \nWeek 16.  \n \nIn addition, at Week 16, Cimzia treatment was associated with a greater proportion of patients \nachieving a DLQI score of  0 or 1 (Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks, 45.5% and 50.6% respectively; \nCimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks, 47.4% and 46.2% respectively, versus placebo, 5.9% and 8.2% \nrespectively).  \n \nImprovements in DLQI score were sustained or slightly decreased through Week 144. \n \nCimzia-treated patients reported greater improvements compared to placebo in the Hospital Anxiety \nand Depression Scale (HADS)-D. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nThe data below reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for \nantibodies to certolizumab pegol in an ELISA and later in a more sensitive method, and are highly \ndependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.  The observed incidence of antibody \n(including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors, \nincluding assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample \ncollection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the \nincidence of antibodies to certolizumab pegol in the studies described below with the incidence of \nantibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nThe overall percentage of patients with antibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least 1 occasion \nwas 9.6% in RA placebo-controlled trials. Approximately one-third of antibody-positive patients had \nantibodies with neutralising activity in vitro. Patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressants \n(MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients not taking immunosuppressants at \nbaseline. Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and in some \npatients, reduced efficacy. \n \nIn 2 long-term (up to 5 years of exposure) open-label studies, the overall percentage of patients with \nantibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion was 13% (8.4% of the overall patients had \ntransient formation of antibodies and an additional 4.7% had persistent formation of antibodies to \nCimzia). The overall percentage of patients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of \ndrug plasma concentration was estimated to be 9.1%. Similar to the placebo-controlled studies, \nantibody positivity was associated with reduced efficacy in some patients. \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \nA pharmacodynamic model based on the Phase III trial data predicts that around 15% of the patients \ndevelop antibodies in 6 months at the recommended dose regimen (200 mg every 2 weeks following a \nloading dose) without MTX co-treatment. This number decreases with increasing doses of \nconcomitant MTX treatment. These data are reasonably in agreement with observed data. \n \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nThe overall percentage of patients with antibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion up to \nWeek 24 was 11.7% in the Phase III placebo-controlled trial in patients with psoriatic arthritis. \nAntibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration.  \n \nOver the course of the entire study (up to 4 years of exposure), the overall percentage of patients with \nantibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion was 17.3% (8.7% had transient formation and \nan additional 8.7% had persistent formation of antibodies to Cimzia). The overall percentage of \npatients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of drug plasma concentration was \nestimated to be 11.5%. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nIn the Phase III placebo- and active-controlled studies, the percentages of patients who were positive \nfor antibodies to Cimzia on at least one occasion during treatment up to Week 48 were 8.3 % (22/265) \nand 19.2% (54/281) for the Cimzia 400 mg every 2 weeks and Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks \nrespectively. In CIMPASI-1 and CIMPASI-2, sixty patients were antibody positive, 27 of these \npatients were evaluable for neutralizing antibodies and tested positive. First occurrences of antibody \npositivity in the open-label treatment period were observed in 2.8% (19/668) of patients. Antibody \npositivity was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and in some patients with reduced \nefficacy. \n \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \nAS001 \nThe overall percentage of patients with antibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion up to \nWeek 24 was 4.4% in the AS001 phase III placebo-controlled trial in patients with axial \nspondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nsubpopulations). Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration. \n\nOver the course of the entire study (up to 192 weeks), the overall percentage of patients with \nantibodies to Cimzia detectable on at least one occasion was 9.6% (4.8% had transient formation and \nan additional 4.8% had persistent formation of antibodies to Cimzia). The overall percentage of \npatients that were antibody positive with a persistent reduction of drug plasma concentration was \nestimated to be 6.8%. \n \nAS0006 and C-OPTIMISE  \nA more sensitive and drug tolerant assay was used for the first time in the AS0006 study (and later \nalso in the C-OPTIMISE study), resulting in a greater proportion of samples having measurable \nantibodies to Cimzia and thus a greater incidence of patients being classed as antibody positive. In \nAS0006,  the overall incidence of patients who were antibody positive Cimzia was 97% \n(248/255 patients) after up to 52 weeks of treatment. Only the highest titers were associated with \nreduced Cimzia plasma levels, however, no impact on efficacy was observed. Similar results in \nrelation to antibodies to Cimzia were seen in C-OPTIMISE. Results from C-OPTIMISE also indicated \nthat a reduction of the dose to Cimzia 200 mg every 4 weeks did not change immunogenicity \noutcomes. \n\n \n\nAbout 22% (54/248) of the patients in AS0006 who were anti-Cimzia antibody positive at any time, \nhad antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. The neutralizing status of antibodies in C-\nOPTIMISE was not assessed. \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nCertolizumab pegol plasma concentrations were broadly dose-proportional. Pharmacokinetics \nobserved in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis were consistent with those seen in healthy \nsubjects. \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, peak plasma concentrations of certolizumab pegol were \nattained between 54 and 171 hours post-injection. Certolizumab pegol has a bioavailability (F) of \napproximately 80% (range 76% to 88%) following subcutaneous administration compared to \nintravenous administration. \n \nDistribution \nThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was estimated at 8.01 l in a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and at 4.71 l in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of \npatients with plaque psoriasis. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nPEGylation, the covalent attachment of PEG polymers to peptides, delays the elimination of these \nentities from the circulation by a variety of mechanisms, including decreased renal clearance, \ndecreased proteolysis, and decreased immunogenicity. Accordingly, certolizumab pegol is an antibody \nFab' fragment conjugated with PEG in order to extend the terminal plasma elimination half-life of the \nFab' to a value comparable with a whole antibody product. The terminal elimination phase half-life \n(t1/2) was approximately 14 days for all doses tested.  \n \nClearance following subcutaneous dosing was estimated to be 21.0 ml/h in a rheumatoid arthritis \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, with an inter-subject variability of 30.8% (CV) and an inter-\noccasion variability of 22.0%. When assessed using the previous ELISA method, the presence of \nantibodies to certolizumab pegol resulted in an approximately three-fold increase in clearance. \nCompared with a 70 kg person, clearance is 29% lower and 38% higher, respectively, in individual RA \npatients weighing 40 kg and 120 kg. The clearance following subcutaneous dosing in patients with \npsoriasis was 14 ml/h with an inter-subject variability of 22.2% (CV). \n \nThe Fab' fragment comprises protein compounds and is expected to be degraded to peptides and amino \nacids by proteolysis. The de-conjugated PEG component is rapidly eliminated from plasma and is to \nan unknown extent excreted renally. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nSpecific clinical trials have not been performed to assess the effect of renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol or its PEG fraction. However, population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis based on subjects with mild renal impairment showed no effect of creatinine clearance. There \nare insufficient data to provide a dosing recommendation in moderate and severe renal impairment. \nThe pharmacokinetics of the PEG fraction of certolizumab pegol are expected to be dependent on \nrenal function but have not been assessed in patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nSpecific clinical trials have not been performed to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) \nSpecific clinical trials have not been performed in elderly patients subjects. However, no effect of age \nwas observed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in \nwhich 78 subjects (13.2% of the population) were aged 65 or greater and the oldest subject was \naged 83 years. No effect of age was observed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in adult \npatients with plaque psoriasis. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \nGender \nThere was no effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol. As clearance decreases \nwith decreasing body weight, females may generally obtain somewhat higher systemic exposure of \ncertolizumab pegol. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nOn the basis of Phase II and Phase III clinical trial data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a \npopulation exposure-response relationship was established between average plasma concentration of \ncertolizumab pegol during a dosing interval (Cavg) and efficacy (ACR 20 responder definition). The \ntypical Cavg that produces half the maximum probability of ACR 20 response (EC50) was 17 \u00b5g/ml \n(95% CI: 10-23 \u00b5g/ml). Similarly, on the basis of Phase III clinical trial data in patients with psoriasis, \na population exposure-response relationship was established between plasma concentration of \ncertolizumab pegol and PASI with an EC90 of 11.1 \u00b5g/ml. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe pivotal non-clinical safety studies were conducted in the cynomolgus monkey. In rats and \nmonkeys, at doses higher than those given to humans, histopathology revealed cellular vacuolation, \npresent mainly in macrophages, in a number of organs (lymph nodes, injection sites, spleen, adrenal, \nuterine, cervix, choroid plexus of the brain, and in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus). It is likely \nthat this finding was caused by cellular uptake of the PEG moiety. In vitro functional studies of human \nvacuolated macrophages indicated all functions tested were retained. Studies in rats indicated that \n> 90% of the administered PEG was eliminated in 3 months following a single dose, with the urine \nbeing the main route of excretion. \n \nCertolizumab pegol does not cross-react with rodent TNF. Therefore, reproductive toxicology studies \nhave been performed with a homologous reagent recognising rat TNF. The value of these data to the \nevaluation of human risk may be limited. No adverse effects were seen on maternal well-being or \nfemale fertility, embryo-foetal and peri- and post-natal reproductive indices in rats using a rodent anti-\nrat TNF\u03b1 PEGylated Fab' (cTN3 PF) following sustained TNF\u03b1 suppression. In male rats, reduced \nsperm motility and a trend of reduced sperm count were observed. \n \nDistribution studies have demonstrated that placental and milk transfer of cTN3 PF to the foetal and \nneonatal circulation is negligible. Certolizumab pegol does not bind to the human neonatal Fc receptor \n(FcRn). Data from a human closed-circuit placental transfer model ex vivo suggest low or negligible \ntransfer to the foetal compartment. In addition, experiments of FcRn-mediated transcytosis in cells \ntransfected with human FcRn showed negligible transfer (see section 4.6).  \n \nNo mutagenic or clastogenic effects were demonstrated in preclinical studies. Carcinogenicity studies \nhave not been performed with certolizumab pegol. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n  \n\n\n\n137 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nCimzia 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \ncertolizumab pegol \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Cimzia is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Cimzia \n3. How to use Cimzia \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Cimzia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nYour physician will also give you a Patient Reminder Card, which contains important safety information \nof which you need to be aware before you are given Cimzia and during treatment with Cimzia. Keep \nthis Patient Reminder Card with you. \n \n \n1. What Cimzia is and what it is used for \n \nCimzia contains the active substance certolizumab pegol, a human antibody fragment. Antibodies are \nproteins that specifically recognise and bind to other proteins. Cimzia binds to a specific protein called \ntumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). Thereby this TNF\u03b1 is blocked by Cimzia and this decreases \ninflammation diseases such as in rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and \npsoriasis. Medicines that bind to TNF\u03b1 are also called TNF blockers. \n \nCimzia is used in adults for the following inflammatory diseases:  \n\uf0b7 rheumatoid arthritis, \n\uf0b7 axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \n\nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis), \n\uf0b7 psoriatic arthritis \n\uf0b7 plaque psoriasis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nCimzia is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the \njoints. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other \nmedicines usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. If your doctor \ndetermines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \n \nCimzia in combination with methotrexate can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive \nrheumatoid arthritis without previous use of methotrexate or other medicines. \n \nCimzia, which you will take in combination with methotrexate, is used to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \n \n\n\n\n138 \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \nCimzia is used to treat severe active ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis (sometimes referred to as non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis). These diseases are inflammatory diseases of the spine. If you have ankylosing \nspondylitis or non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you \ndo not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cimzia to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nCimzia is used to treat active psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the \njoints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given \nother medicines, usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will \nbe given Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \nIf your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory \ndisease of the skin, and can also affect your scalp and nails.  \nCimzia is used to reduce skin inflammation and other signs and symptoms of your disease.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Cimzia \n \nDo NOT use Cimzia \n- If you are ALLERGIC (hypersensitive) to certolizumab pegol or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6) \n- If you have a severe infection, including active TUBERCULOSIS (TB). \n- If you have moderate to severe HEART FAILURE. Tell your doctor if you have had or have a \n\nserious heart condition. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTell your doctor before treatment with Cimzia if any of the following applies to you: \n \nAllergic reactions \n- If you experience ALLERGIC REACTIONS such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, stop using Cimzia and contact your doctor IMMEDIATELY. Some of these \nreactions could occur after the first administration of Cimzia. \n\n-  If you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. \n \nInfections \n- If you have had RECURRENT or OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections (such as treatment with immunosuppressants, which are \nmedicines that could reduce your ability to fight infections). \n\n- If you have an infection or if you develop symptoms such as fever, wounds, tiredness or dental \nproblems. You might get an infection more easily while you are being treated with Cimzia, \nincluding serious, or in rare cases, life-threatening infections. \n\n- TUBERCULOSIS (TB) cases have been reported in patients treated with Cimzia, your doctor \nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Cimzia. This will include \na thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests \nshould be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. If latent (inactive) tuberculosis is diagnosed, \nyou might be required to receive appropriate anti-tuberculosis medicines before starting Cimzia. \nIn rare occasions tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventive \n\n\n\n139 \n\ntreatment for tuberculosis. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If \nsymptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other \ninfection appear during or after therapy with Cimzia tell your doctor immediately. \n\n- If you are at risk of or are a carrier of or have active HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) infection, \nCimzia may increase the risk of reactivation in people who carry this virus. If this occurs, you \nshould stop using Cimzia. Your doctor should test you for HBV before starting Cimzia. \n\n \nHeart failure \n- If you have mild HEART FAILURE and you are being treated with Cimzia, your heart failure \n\nstatus must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have \nhad or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart \nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n \nCancer \n- It is uncommon, but cases of certain types of CANCER have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith Cimzia or other TNF blockers. People with more severe rheumatoid arthritis that have had \nthe disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that \naffects the lymph system, called lymphoma. If you take Cimzia, your risk of getting lymphoma \nor other cancers may increase. In addition, uncommon cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have \nbeen observed in patients taking Cimzia. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy with \nCimzia or existing skin lesions change appearance, tell your doctor.  \n\n- There have been cases of cancers, including unusual types, in children and teenage patients \ntaking TNF-blocking agents, which sometimes resulted in death (see further down \u201cChildren \nand adolescents\u201d). \n\n \nOther disorders \n- Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or who are heavy smokers, may \n\nbe at increased risk for cancer with Cimzia treatment. If you have COPD or are a heavy smoker, \nyou should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for \nyou. \n\n- If you have a nervous system disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide \nwhether you should use Cimzia. \n\n- In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor immediately. Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n- It is uncommon, but symptoms of a disease called lupus (for example persistent rash, fever, joint \npain and tiredness) may occur. If you experience these symptoms, contact your doctor. Your \ndoctor may decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n \nVaccinations \n- Talk to your doctor if you have had, or are due to have a vaccine. You should not receive certain \n\n(live) vaccines while using Cimzia. \n- Certain vaccinations may cause infections. If you received Cimzia while you were pregnant, \n\nyour baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately five \nmonths after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your \nbaby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Cimza use so they can decide \nwhen your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nOperations or dental procedures \n- Talk to your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures. Tell your \n\nsurgeon or dentist performing the procedure that you are having treatment with Cimzia by \nshowing them your Patient Reminder Card. \n\n \n\n\n\n140 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nCimzia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Cimzia \nYou should NOT take Cimzia if you are using the following medicines used to treat rheumatoid \narthritis: \n- anakinra  \n- abatacept \nIf you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nCimzia can be taken together with: \n- methotrexate,  \n- corticosteroids, or  \n- pain medicines including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (also called NSAIDs). \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere is limited experience with Cimzia in pregnant women. \nCimzia should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If you are a woman of childbearing \npotential, discuss with your doctor regarding use of adequate contraception while using Cimzia. For \nwomen planning pregnancy, contraception may be considered for 5 months after the last Cimzia dose. \n \nIf you received Cimzia during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection. It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about \nyour Cimzia use before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section on \nvaccinations). \n \nCimzia can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCimzia may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness (including \nroom spinning sensation, blurred vision and tiredness) may occur after you take Cimzia. \n \nCimzia contains sodium acetate and sodium chloride \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 400 mg, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Cimzia \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n\uf0b7 The starting dose for adults with rheumatoid arthritis is 400 mg given at weeks 0, 2 and 4.  \n\uf0b7 This is followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks.

The following instructions explain how to inject Cimzia. Please read the \ninstructions carefully and follow them step by step. You will be instructed by your doctor or healthcare \ngiver on the technique of self-injection. Do not attempt to self-inject until you are sure that you \nunderstand how to prepare and give the injection.  \n \nThis injection should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other medicine. \n \n1. Setting up \n\u2022 Remove the Cimzia pack from the refrigerator. \n\n\uf02d If the seal(s) is missing or broken \u2013 do not use and contact your pharmacist.  \n\u2022 Remove the following items from the Cimzia pack and set them up on a clean flat surface: \n\n\u2013 One or two pre-filled syringe(s), depending on your prescribed dose \n\u2013 One or two alcohol wipe(s) \n\n\u2022 Look at the expiry date on the syringe and pack. Do not use Cimzia after the expiry date which \nis stated on the pack and syringe after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of the month \nshown. \n\n\u2022 Allow the pre-filled syringe to reach room temperature. This will take 30 minutes. This will \nhelp reduce discomfort when injecting. \n\uf02d Do not heat the pre-filled syringe \u2013 let it warm on its own. \n\n\u2022 Do not remove the cap until you are ready to inject. \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n2. Choosing and preparing an injection site \n\u2022 Choose a site on your thigh or tummy. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Each new injection should be given on a separate site from the last injection site. \n\uf02d Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard.  \n\uf02d Wipe the injection site with the enclosed alcohol wipe, using a circular motion moving \n\nfrom the inside out. \n\uf02d Do not touch the area again before injecting. \n \n\n3. Injection \n\u2022 Do not shake the syringe. \n\nCheck the medicine in the body of the syringe.  \n\uf02d Do not use if the solution is discoloured, cloudy or if you can see particles in it.  \n\uf02d You may see air bubbles - this is normal. Injecting a solution subcutaneously which \n\ncontains air bubbles is harmless. \n\n\n\n148 \n\n\u2022 Remove the cap from the needle in a straight direction, being careful not to touch the needle or \nlet the needle touch any surface. Do not bend the needle. \n\n\u2022 Inject within 5 minutes of removing the needle cap. \n\u2022 Gently grasp the cleaned area of skin with one hand and hold firmly. \n \n\n \n\u2022 With the other hand, hold the syringe at a 45-degree angle to the skin. \n\u2022 With one quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into the skin. \n\u2022 Push the plunger to inject solution. It can take up to 10 seconds to empty the syringe. \n\u2022 When the syringe is empty, carefully remove the needle from the skin at the same angle at \n\nwhich it was inserted. \n\u2022 Release the skin with the first hand. \n\u2022 Use a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for a few seconds: \n\n\uf02d Do not rub the injection site.  \n\uf02d You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. \n\n \n4. After Use \n\u2022 Do not re-use the syringe or re-cap the needle. \n\u2022 After injection, immediately throw away the used syringe(s) in a special container as instructed \n\nby your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.  \n\n \n\u2022 Keep the container out of the sight and reach of children. \n\uf0b7 If you need to have a second injection as prescribed by your doctor repeat the injection process \n\nstarting at Step 2. \n\n\n\n149 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nCimzia 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nPre-filled syringe with needle guard \n\ncertolizumab pegol \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Cimzia is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Cimzia \n3. How Cimzia will be given \n4. Possible side effects \n5.  How to store Cimzia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nYour physician will also give you a Patient Reminder Card, which contains important safety information \nof which you need to be aware before you are given Cimzia and during treatment with Cimzia. Keep \nthis Patient Reminder Card with you. \n \n \n1. What Cimzia is and what it is used for \n \nCimzia contains the active substance certolizumab pegol, a human antibody fragment. Antibodies are \nproteins that specifically recognise and bind to other proteins. Cimzia binds to a specific protein called \ntumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). Thereby this TNF\u03b1 is blocked by Cimzia and this decreases \ninflammation diseases such as in rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and \npsoriasis. Medicines that bind to TNF\u03b1 are also called TNF blockers. \n \nCimzia is used in adults for the following inflammatory diseases:  \n\uf0b7 rheumatoid arthritis, \n\uf0b7 axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \n\nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis )  \n\uf0b7 psoriatic arthritis.  \n\uf0b7 plaque psoriasis \n\n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \nCimzia is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the \njoints. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other \nmedicines usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. If your doctor \ndetermines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \nCimzia in combination with methotrexate can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive \nrheumatoid arthritis without previous use of methotrexate or other medicines. \n \nCimzia, which you will take in combination with methotrexate, is used to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \n  \n\n\n\n150 \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \nCimzia is used to treat severe active ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis (sometimes referred to as non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis). These diseases are inflammatory diseases of the spine. If you have ankylosing \nspondylitis or non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you \ndo not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cimzia to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nCimzia is used to treat active psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the \njoints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given \nother medicines, usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will \nbe given Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \nIf your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory \ndisease of the skin, and can also affect your scalp and nails.  \nCimzia is used to reduce skin inflammation and other signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Cimzia \n \nDo NOT use Cimzia \n- If you are ALLERGIC (hypersensitive) to certolizumab pegol or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6) \n- If you have a severe infection, including active TUBERCULOSIS (TB). \n- If you have moderate to severe HEART FAILURE. Tell your doctor if you have had or have a \n\nserious heart condition. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTell your doctor before treatment with Cimzia if any of the following applies to you: \n \nAllergic reactions \n- If you experience ALLERGIC REACTIONS such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, stop using Cimzia and contact your doctor IMMEDIATELY. Some of these \nreactions could occur after the first administration of Cimzia. \n\n-  If you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. \n \nInfections \n- If you have had RECURRENT or OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections (such as treatment with immunosuppressants, which are \nmedicines that could reduce your ability to fight infections). \n\n- If you have an infection or if you develop symptoms such as fever, wounds, tiredness or dental \nproblems. You might get an infection more easily while you are being treated with Cimzia, \nincluding serious, or in rare cases, life-threatening infections. \n\n- TUBERCULOSIS (TB) cases have been reported in patients treated with Cimzia, your doctor \nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Cimzia. This will include \na thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests \nshould be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. If latent (inactive) tuberculosis is diagnosed, \nyou might be required to receive appropriate anti-tuberculosis medicines before starting Cimzia. \nIn rare occasions tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventive \n\n\n\n151 \n\ntreatment for tuberculosis. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If \nsymptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other \ninfection appear during or after therapy with Cimzia tell your doctor immediately. \n\n- If you are at risk of or are a carrier of or have active HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) infection, \nCimzia may increase the risk of reactivation in people who carry this virus. If this occurs, you \nshould stop using Cimzia. Your doctor should test you for HBV before starting Cimzia. \n\n \nHeart failure \n- If you have mild HEART FAILURE and you are being treated with Cimzia, your heart failure \n\nstatus must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have \nhad or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart \nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n \nCancer \n- It is uncommon, but cases of certain types of CANCER have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith Cimzia or other TNF blockers. People with more severe rheumatoid arthritis that have had \nthe disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that \naffects the lymph system, called lymphoma. If you take Cimzia, your risk of getting lymphoma \nor other cancers may increase. In addition, uncommon cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have \nbeen observed in patients taking Cimzia. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy with \nCimzia or existing skin lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n- There have been cases of cancers, including unusual types, in children and teenage patients \ntaking TNF-blocking agents, which sometimes resulted in death (see further down \u201cChildren \nand adolescents\u201d). \n\n \nOther disorders \n- Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or who are heavy smokers, may \n\nbe at increased risk for cancer with Cimzia treatment. If you have COPD or are a heavy smoker, \nyou should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for \nyou. \n\n- If you have a nervous system disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide \nwhether you should use Cimzia. \n\n- In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor immediately. Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n- It is uncommon, but symptoms of a disease called lupus (for example persistent rash, fever, joint \npain and tiredness) may occur. If you experience these symptoms, contact your doctor. Your \ndoctor may decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n \nVaccinations \n- Talk to your doctor if you have had, or are due to have a vaccine. You should not receive certain \n\n(live) vaccines while using Cimzia. \n- Certain vaccinations may cause infections. If you received Cimzia while you were pregnant, \n\nyour baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately five \nmonths after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your \nbaby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Cimza use so they can decide \nwhen your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nOperations or dental procedures \n- Talk to your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures. Tell your \n\nsurgeon or dentist performing the procedure that you are having treatment with Cimzia by \nshowing them your Patient Reminder Card. \n\n \n\n\n\n152 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nCimzia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Cimzia \nYou should NOT take Cimzia if you are using the following medicines used to treat rheumatoid \narthritis: \n- anakinra  \n- abatacept \nIf you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nCimzia can be taken together with: \n- methotrexate,  \n- corticosteroids, or  \n- pain medicines including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (also called NSAIDs). \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere is limited experience with Cimzia in pregnant women.  \nCimzia should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If you are a woman of childbearing \npotential discuss with your doctor regarding use of adequate contraception while using Cimzia. For \nwomen planning pregnancy, contraception may be considered for 5 months after the last Cimzia dose. \n \nIf you received Cimzia during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection. It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about \nyour Cimzia use before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section on \nvaccinations). \n \nCimzia can be used during breastfeeding.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nCimzia may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness (including \nroom spinning sensation, blurred vision and tiredness) may occur after you take Cimzia. \n \nCimzia contains sodium acetate and sodium chloride \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 400 mg, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How Cimzia will be given \n \nCimzia will be given to you by your doctor or nurse, in hospital or clinic. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n\uf0b7 The starting dose for adults with rheumatoid arthritis is 400 mg given at weeks 0, 2 and 4.  \n\uf0b7 This is followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks. If you respond to the \n\nmedicine, your doctor may prescribe an alternative maintenance dosing of 400 mg \nevery 4 weeks.  \n\n\uf0b7 Methotrexate is continued while using Cimzia. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \n\n \n\n\n\n153 \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis \n\uf0b7 The starting dose for adults with axial spondyloarthritis is 400 mg given at weeks 0, 2 and 4.  \n\uf0b7 This is followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks (from week 6) or 400 mg \n\nevery 4 weeks (from week 8) as instructed by your physician. If you have received Cimzia for at \nleast 1 year and respond to the medicine, your physician may prescribe a reduced maintenance \ndose of 200 mg every 4 weeks. \n\n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n\uf0b7 The starting dose for adults with psoriatic arthritis is 400 mg given at weeks 0, 2 and 4.  \n\uf0b7 This is followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks. If you respond to the \n\nmedicine, your doctor may prescribe an alternative maintenance dosing of 400 mg \nevery 4 weeks.  \n\n\uf0b7 Methotrexate is continued while using Cimzia. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \n\n \nPlaque psoriasis \n\uf0b7 The starting dose for adults with plaque psoriasis is 400 mg every 2 weeks given at \n\nweeks 0, 2 and 4.  \n\uf0b7 This is followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks, or 400 mg every 2 weeks as \n\ninstructed by your physician.  \n \nHow Cimzia is given \nCimzia will be given to you by a specialist doctor or healthcare professional. You will be given \nCimzia as either one (200 mg dose) or two injections (400 mg dose) under the skin (subcutaneous use, \nabbreviation: SC). It is usually injected into the thigh or tummy. However, do not inject in an area \nwhere the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard. \n \nIf you are given too much Cimzia  \nAs this medecine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. \nAlways take the Patient Reminder Card with you.  \n \nIf you forget to use Cimzia \nIf you forget or miss an appointment to receive Cimzia, make another appointment as soon as possible.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor IMMEDIATELY if you notice any of the following side effects: \n\uf0b7 severe rash, hives or other signs of allergic reaction (urticaria) \n\uf0b7 swollen face, hands, feet (angioedema) \n\uf0b7 trouble breathing, swallowing (multiple causes for these symptoms) \n\uf0b7 shortness of breath with exertion or upon lying down or swelling of the feet (heart failure) \n\uf0b7 symptoms of blood disorders such as persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, paleness \n\n(pancytopaenia, anaemia, low platelet count, low white blood cell count) \n\uf0b7 serious skin rashes.

Please read the instructions carefully and \nfollow them step by step.  \n \nThis injection should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other medicine. \n \nBelow is a diagram of the pre-filled syringe with needle guard. \n \n \n\n\n\n159 \n\n \nFigure 1  \n\n \n1: Needle cap \n\n2: Plunger head \n3: Needle guard activation clips \n\n \nFor each injection you will need: \n\u2022 1 pre-filled syringe with needle guard \n\u2022 1 alcohol wipe \n \n1. Setting up \n\u2022 Remove the Cimzia pack from the refrigerator. \n\n\u2013 If the seal(s) is missing or broken \u2013 do not use and contact your pharmacist. \n\u2022 Remove the following items from the Cimzia pack and set them up on a clean flat surface: \n\n\u2013 One or two pre-filled syringe(s), depending on your prescriber dose \n\u2013 One or two alcohol wipe(s) \n\n\u2022 Look at the expiry date on the pack and dose tray. Do not use Cimzia after the expiry date which \nis stated on the pack and dose tray after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of the month \nshown. \n\n\u2022 Allow the pre-filled syringe to reach room temperature. This will take 30 minutes. This will \nhelp reduce discomfort when injecting. \n\u2013 Do not heat the medication - let it warm up on its own. \n\n\u2022 Remove the prefilled syringe from the dose tray by grasping the syringe body as shown in \nFigure 2. Do NOT touch the needle guard activation clips (labelled as 3 in Figure 1) during \nremoval (as shown in Figure 3) in order to prevent prematurely covering the needle with \nthe needle guard. \n\n \n\n  \n Figure 2  Figure 3 \n\n \n \n\u2022 Do not use the syringe if it has been dropped without its packaging. \n\u2022 Do not remove the cap until you are ready to inject. \n\n\n\n160 \n\n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n2. Choosing and preparing an injection site \n\u2022 Choose a site on the thigh or abdomen. \n\u2022 Each new injection should be given on a separate site from the last injection site. \n\n\uf02d Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard. \n\uf02d Wipe the injection site with the enclosed alcohol wipe, using a circular motion moving \n\nfrom the inside out. \n\uf02d Do not touch this area again before injection. \n\uf02d Do not inject until the skin is dry. \n\n \n3. Injection \n\u2022 Do not shake the syringe. \n\nCheck the medicine in the body of the syringe.  \n\uf02d Do not use if the solution is discoloured, cloudy or if you can see particles in it. \n\uf02d  You may see some air bubbles - this is normal. Injecting the solution subcutaneously \n\nwith air bubbles is harmless. \n\u2022 Remove the needle cap from the needle by pulling off in a straight line. Take care not to touch \n\nthe needle or let the needle touch any surface. Do NOT touch the needle guard activation \nclips (labelled as 3 in Figure 1) during removal in order to prevent prematurely covering \nthe needle with the needle guard. Inject within 5 minutes of removing the needle cap. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 Gently grasp the cleaned area of skin with one hand and hold firmly. \n\u2022 With the other hand, hold syringe at a 45-degree angle to skin. \n\u2022 With one quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into the skin. \n \n\n \n\u2022 Release the skin with the first hand. \n\u2022 Push plunger head all the way down until the entire dose has been given and the plunger head is \n\nbetween the needle guard activation clips. It can take up to 10 seconds to empty the syringe. \n\n\n\n161 \n\n \n\n \n     \n\n\u2022 When the syringe is empty, carefully remove the needle from the skin at the same angle at \nwhich it was inserted. \n\n\u2022 Take your thumb off the plunger head. The empty syringe and needle will automatically move \nback into the barrel and lock in place. \n\n\u2022 The needle safety device will not activate unless the entire dose is given. \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 Use a piece of gauze to apply pressure over the injection site for a few seconds: \n\uf02d Do not rub the injection site. \n\uf02d You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. \n\n \n4. After Use \n\u2022 Do not re-use the syringe.  \n\u2022 Any unused product(s) or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\u2022 If a second injection is needed as prescribed by the doctor repeat the injection process starting at \n\nStep 2. \n\n\n\n162 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nCimzia 200 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \ncertolizumab pegol \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Cimzia is and for what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Cimzia \n3. How to use Cimzia \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Cimzia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nYour physician will also give you a Patient Reminder Card, which contains important safety information \nof which you need to be aware before you are given Cimzia and during treatment with Cimzia. Keep \nthis Patient Reminder Card with you. \n \n \n1. What Cimzia is and what it is used for \n \nCimzia contains the active substance certolizumab pegol, a human antibody fragment. Antibodies are \nproteins that specifically recognise and bind to other proteins. Cimzia binds to a specific protein called \ntumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). Thereby this TNF\u03b1 is blocked by Cimzia and this decreases \ninflammation diseases such as in rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and \npsoriasis. Medicines that bind to TNF\u03b1 are also called TNF blockers. \n \nCimzia is used in adults for the following inflammatory diseases:  \n\uf0b7 rheumatoid arthritis, \n\uf0b7 axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \n\nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis), \n\uf0b7 psoriatic arthritis, \n\uf0b7 plaque psoriasis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nCimzia is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the \njoints. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other \nmedicines usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. If your doctor \ndetermines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \n \nCimzia in combination with methotrexate can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive \nrheumatoid arthritis without previous use of methotrexate or other medicines. \n \nCimzia, which you will take in combination with methotrexate, is used to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \n\n\n\n163 \n\n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \nCimzia is used to treat severe active ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis (sometimes referred to as non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis). These diseases are inflammatory diseases of the spine. If you have ankylosing \nspondylitis or non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you \ndo not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cimzia to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nCimzia is used to treat active psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the \njoints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given \nother medicines, usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will \nbe given Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to: \n\n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \n\nIf your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory \ndisease of the skin, and can also affect your scalp and nails.  \nCimzia is used to reduce skin inflammation and other signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Cimzia \n \nDo NOT use Cimzia \n- If you are ALLERGIC (hypersensitive) to certolizumab pegol or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6) \n- If you have a severe infection, including active TUBERCULOSIS (TB). \n- If you have moderate to severe HEART FAILURE. Tell your doctor if you have had or have a \n\nserious heart condition. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTell your doctor before treatment with Cimzia if any of the following applies to you: \n \nAllergic reactions \n- If you experience ALLERGIC REACTIONS such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, stop using Cimzia and contact your doctor IMMEDIATELY. Some of these \nreactions could occur after the first administration of Cimzia. \n\n-  If you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. \n \nInfections \n- If you have had RECURRENT or OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections (such as treatment with immunosuppressants, which are \nmedicines that could reduce your ability to fight infections). \n\n- If you have an infection or if you develop symptoms such as fever, wounds, tiredness or dental \nproblems. You might get an infection more easily while you are being treated with Cimzia, \nincluding serious, or in rare cases, life-threatening infections. \n\n- TUBERCULOSIS (TB) cases have been reported in patients treated with Cimzia, your doctor \nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Cimzia. This will include \na thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests \nshould be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. If latent (inactive) tuberculosis is diagnosed, \nyou might be required to receive appropriate anti-tuberculosis medicines before starting Cimzia. \n\n\n\n164 \n\nIn rare occasions tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventive \ntreatment for tuberculosis. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If \nsymptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other \ninfection appear during or after therapy with Cimzia tell your doctor immediately. \n\n- If you are at risk of or are a carrier of or have active HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) infection, \nCimzia may increase the risk of reactivation in people who carry this virus. If this occurs, you \nshould stop using Cimzia. Your doctor should test you for HBV before starting Cimzia. \n\n \nHeart failure \n- If you have mild HEART FAILURE and you are being treated with Cimzia, your heart failure \n\nstatus must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have \nhad or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart \nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n \nCancer \n- It is uncommon, but cases of certain types of CANCER have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith Cimzia or other TNF blockers. People with more severe rheumatoid arthritis that have had \nthe disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that \naffects the lymph system, called lymphoma. If you take Cimzia, your risk of getting lymphoma \nor other cancers may increase. In addition, uncommon cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have \nbeen observed in patients taking Cimzia. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy with \nCimzia or existing skin lesions change appearance, tell your doctor.  \n\n- There have been cases of cancers, including unusual types, in children and teenage patients \ntaking TNF-blocking agents, which sometimes resulted in death (see further down \u201cChildren \nand adolescents\u201d). \n\n \nOther disorders \n- Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or who are heavy smokers, may \n\nbe at increased risk for cancer with Cimzia treatment. If you have COPD or are a heavy smoker, \nyou should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for \nyou. \n\n- If you have a nervous system disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide \nwhether you should use Cimzia. \n\n- In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor immediately. Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n- It is uncommon, but symptoms of a disease called lupus (for example persistent rash, fever, joint \npain and tiredness) may occur. If you experience these symptoms, contact your doctor.

The following instructions explain how to use the pre-filled pen \n(AutoClicks) to inject Cimzia. Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. You \nwill be instructed by your doctor or healthcare giver on the technique of self-injection. Do not attempt \nto self-inject until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection.  \n \nBelow is a diagram of the AutoClicks pre-filled pen. \n \n\n \n \n\n1: Orange band \n2: Viewing window \n\n3: Black handle \n4: Clear cap \n\n \n1. Setting up \n\uf0b7 Remove the Cimzia pack from the refrigerator. \n\n\u2013 If the seal(s) is missing or broken \u2013 do not use and contact your pharmacist. \n\uf0b7 Remove the following items from the Cimzia pack and set them up on a clean flat surface: \n\n\u25e6 One or two AutoClicks pre-filled pen(s), depending on your prescribed dose \n\u25e6 One or two alcohol wipe(s) \n\n\uf0b7 Look at the expiry date on the pre-filled pen and pack. Do not use Cimzia after the expiry date \nwhich is stated on the pack and pre-filled pen after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of \nthe month shown. \n\n\uf0b7 Allow the AutoClicks pre filled pen(s) to reach room temperature. This will \ntake 30 to 45 minutes. This will help to reduce discomfort when injecting. \n\uf02d Do not heat the medication - let it warm up on its own \n\uf02d Do not remove the cap until you are ready to inject. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n2. Choosing and preparing an injection site \n\uf0b7 Choose a site on your thigh or tummy. \n\n\n\n173 \n\n \n\uf0b7 Each new injection should be given on a separate site from the last injection site. \n\n\uf02d Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard.  \n\uf02d Wipe the injection site with the enclosed alcohol wipe, using a circular motion moving \n\nfrom the inside out. \n\uf02d Do not touch the area again before injecting. \n\n \n3. Injection \n\uf0b7 AutoClicks pre-filled pen is designed to work accurately and safely. However, if any of the \n\nfollowing steps go wrong and/or if you feel unsure about the injection process, contact your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not shake the pre-filled pen.  \n\nCheck the medicine through the viewing window.  \n\uf02d Do not use the pre-filled pen if the solution is discoloured, cloudy or if you can see \n\nparticles in it. \n\uf02d You may see air bubbles - this is normal. Injecting the solution subcutaneously which \n\ncontains air bubbles is harmless. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Hold the pre-filled pen firmly with one hand around the black handle. \n\uf0b7 Grasp the clear cap with the other hand and pull it straight off. Do not twist the cap while \n\nremoving it, this could jam the internal mechanism. \n \n\n  \n\n \n\u2022 Inject within 5 minutes of removing the cap. Do not replace the cap. \n\n\n\n174 \n\n\u2022 Although hidden from view the needle tip is now uncovered. Do not try to touch the needle as it \ncould activate the pre-filled pen. Hold the pre-filled pen straight (at a 90\u00b0 degree angle) against \nthe skin, that previously has been cleaned (the \u201cinjection site\u201d). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 Press the pre-filled pen firmly against the skin. The injection begins when a first \u201cclick\u201d is heard \nand the orange band at the bottom of the pre-filled pen disappears. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Continue to hold the pre-filled pen in place firmly against the skin until a second \u201cclick\u201d is \n\nheard and the viewing window turns orange. This can take up to 15 seconds. At this time, the \ninjection will be complete. If the viewing window turns orange and you hear a second click this \nmeans the injection has been completed. If you feel unsure about the injection process, please \ncontact your doctor or pharmacist. Do not try to repeat the injection process without speaking to \nyour doctor or your pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\u2022 The needle will automatically move back into the empty pen. Do not try to touch the needle. \n\u2022 You can now remove the used pen by pulling the pen straight up carefully from the skin. \n\u2022 Use a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for a few seconds: \n\n\uf02d Do not rub the injection site.  \n\uf02d You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. \n\n \n4. After Use \n\u2022 Do not re-use the pen. There is no need to replace the cap. \n\n\n\n175 \n\n\u2022 After injection, immediately throw away the used pen(s) in a special container as instructed by \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n \n\n\u2022 Keep the container out of the sight and reach of children. \n\u2022 If you need to have a second injection as prescribed by your doctor repeat the injection process \n\nstarting at Step 2. \n\n\n\n176 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nCimzia 200 mg solution for injection in dose-dispenser cartridge \ncertolizumab pegol \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nYour physician will also give you a Patient Reminder Card, which contains important safety information \nof which you need to be aware before you are given Cimzia and during treatment with Cimzia. Keep \nthis Patient Reminder Card with you. \n \n \n1. What Cimzia is and what it is used for \n \nCimzia contains the active substance certolizumab pegol, a human antibody fragment. Antibodies are \nproteins that specifically recognise and bind to other proteins. Cimzia binds to a specific protein called \ntumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). Thereby this TNF\u03b1 is blocked by Cimzia and this decreases \ninflammation diseases such as in rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and \npsoriasis. Medicines that bind to TNF\u03b1 are also called TNF blockers. \n \nCimzia is used in adults for the following inflammatory diseases:  \n\uf0b7 rheumatoid arthritis, \n\uf0b7 axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \n\nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis), \n\uf0b7 psoriatic arthritis, \n\uf0b7 plaque psoriasis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nCimzia is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the \njoints. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other \nmedicines usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. If your doctor \ndetermines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \n \nCimzia in combination with methotrexate can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive \nrheumatoid arthritis without previous use of methotrexate or other medicines treatment. \n \nCimzia, which you will take in combination with methotrexate, is used to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \n \n\n\n\n177 \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \nCimzia is used to treat severe active ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis (sometimes referred to as non-radiographic axial \nspondyloarthritis). These diseases are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  \n \nIf you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given \nother medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Cimzia to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nCimzia is used to treat active psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the \njoints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given \nother medicines, usually methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will \nbe given Cimzia in combination with methotrexate to: \n\uf0b7 reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n\uf0b7 improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. \nIf your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, Cimzia can be given alone. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nCimzia is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory \ndisease of the skin, and can also affect your scalp and nails.  \nCimzia is used to reduce skin inflammation and other signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Cimzia \n \nDo NOT use Cimzia:  \n- If you are ALLERGIC (hypersensitive) to certolizumab pegol or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6) \n- If you have a severe infection, including active TUBERCULOSIS (TB). \n- If you have moderate to severe HEART FAILURE. Tell your doctor if you have had or have a \n\nserious heart condition. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Cimzia if any of the following applies to you: \n \nAllergic reactions \n- If you experience ALLERGIC REACTIONS such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, stop using Cimzia and contact your doctor IMMEDIATELY. Some of these \nreactions could occur after the first administration of Cimzia. \n\n-  If you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. \n \nInfections \n- If you have had RECURRENT or OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections (such as treatment with immunosuppressants, which are \nmedicines that could reduce your ability to fight infections). \n\n- If you have an infection or if you develop symptoms such as fever, wounds, tiredness or dental \nproblems. You might get an infection more easily while you are being treated with Cimzia, \nincluding serious, or in rare cases, life-threatening infections. \n\n- TUBERCULOSIS (TB) cases have been reported in patients treated with Cimzia, your doctor \nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Cimzia. This will include \na thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests \nshould be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. If latent (inactive) tuberculosis is diagnosed, \nyou might be required to receive appropriate anti tuberculosis medicines before starting Cimzia. \nIn rare occasions tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventive \n\n\n\n178 \n\ntreatment for tuberculosis. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. If \nsymptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other \ninfection appear during or after therapy with Cimzia tell your doctor immediately. \n\n- If you are at risk of or are a carrier of or have active HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) infection, \nCimzia may increase the risk of reactivation in people who carry this virus. If this occurs, you \nshould stop using Cimzia. Your doctor should test you for HBV before starting Cimzia. \n\n \nHeart failure \n- If you have mild HEART FAILURE and you are being treated with Cimzia, your heart failure \n\nstatus must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have \nhad or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart \nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n \nCancer \n- It is uncommon, but cases of certain types of CANCER have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith Cimzia or other TNF blockers. People with more severe rheumatoid arthritis that have had \nthe disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting a kind of cancer that \naffects the lymph system, called lymphoma. If you take Cimzia, your risk of getting lymphoma \nor other cancers may increase. In addition, uncommon cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have \nbeen observed in patients taking Cimzia. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy with \nCimzia or existing skin lesions change appearance, tell your doctor.  \n\n- There have been cases of cancers, including unusual types, in children and teenage patients \ntaking TNF blocking agents, which sometimes resulted in death (see further down \u201cChildren \nand adolescents\u201d). \n\n \nOther disorders \n- Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or who are heavy smokers, may \n\nbe at increased risk for cancer with Cimzia treatment. If you have COPD or are a heavy smoker, \nyou should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for \nyou. \n\n- If you have a nervous system disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide \nwhether you should use Cimzia. \n\n- In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor immediately. Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n- It is uncommon, but symptoms of a disease called lupus (for example persistent rash, fever, joint \npain and tiredness) may occur. If you experience these symptoms, contact your doctor. Your \ndoctor may decide to stop treatment with Cimzia. \n\n \nVaccinations \n- Talk to your doctor if you have had, or are due to have a vaccine. You should not receive certain \n\n(live) vaccines while using Cimzia. \n- Certain vaccinations may cause infections. If you received Cimzia while you were pregnant, \n\nyour baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately five \nmonths after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your \nbaby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Cimza use so they can decide \nwhen your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \nOperations or dental procedures \n- Talk to your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures. Tell your \n\nsurgeon or dentist performing the procedure that you are having treatment with Cimzia by \nshowing them your Patient Reminder Card. \n\n \n\n\n\n179 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nCimzia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Cimzia \nYou should NOT take Cimzia if you are using the following medicines used to treat rheumatoid \narthritis: \n- anakinra  \n- abatacept \nIf you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nCimzia can be taken together with: \n- methotrexate,  \n- corticosteroids, or  \n- pain medicines including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (also called NSAIDs). \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere is limited experience with Cimzia in pregnant women.  \nCimzia should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. If you are a woman of childbearing \npotential discuss with your doctor regarding use of adequate contraception while using Cimzia. For \nwomen planning pregnancy, contraception may be considered for 5 months after the last Cimzia dose. \n \nIf you received Cimzia during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection. It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about \nyour Cimzia use before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section on \nvaccinations). \n \nCimzia can be used during breastfeeding.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nCimzia may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness (including \nroom spinning sensation, blurred vision and tiredness) may occur after you take Cimzia. \n \nCimzia contains sodium acetate and sodium chloride \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 400 mg, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3.

The dose-dispenser cartridge is also referred to as \u201cmedication\u201d. \n\uf0b7 The medication is to be used with the electromechanical injection device called \u201cava\u201d which is \n\nprovided separately. \n\uf0b7 You must also carefully read the full instructions in the ava User Manual. \nYou can inject yourself or the injection can be given by someone else (caregiver).  \nIf your doctor says you can inject yourself, you need to be fully trained first.  \n\uf0b7 You will be instructed by your doctor or healthcare giver how to inject the medicine.  \n\uf0b7 If something is not clear \u2013 please ask your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nMedication: dose-dispenser cartridge \n\n \n \n\n1.

Medication body \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n187 \n\nInjection device: ava \n \n\n \n\n1. On/Off Button  \n\n2. Start/Pause button  \n3. Cartridge/Injection port  \n4. Skin sensor (the skin sensor detects when the injection port is fully in contact with your skin).  \n5. Scroll wheel (to adjust the speed of injection) \n6. Information screen  \n7. Micro-USB Port  \n \n1. Setting up \n\uf0b7 Remove the Cimzia carton from the refrigerator. \n\n\u2013 If the seal(s) is missing or broken \u2013 do not use and contact your pharmacist. \n\u2022 Remove the following items from the Cimzia pack and set them up on a clean flat surface: \n\n\u2013 One or two medication cartridge(s), depending on your prescribed dose \n\u2013 One or two alcohol wipe(s) \n\n\uf0b7 Look at the expiry date on the medication and pack. Do not use Cimzia after the expiry date \nwhich is stated on the pack and medication after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of \nthe month shown. \n\n\uf0b7 Allow the medication to reach room temperature. This will take from 30 to 45 minutes. This \nwill help reduce discomfort when injecting.  \n\u2013 Do not heat the medication - let it warm up on its own. \n\u2013 Use a clean dry cloth to wipe off any condensation on the outside of the cartridge. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not remove the needle cap until ava instructs you to do so. \n\uf0b7 Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n \n\n\n\n188 \n\n2. Choosing and preparing an injection site \n\u2022 Choose a site on your thighs or tummy. \n\n \n\n \n\u2022 Each new injection should be given on a site separate from the last injection site. \n\n\u2013  Do not inject in an area where the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard.  \n\u2013 Wipe the injection site with an alcohol wipe, using a circular motion moving from the \n\ninside  \nout. \n\u2013 Do not touch the area again before injecting.  \n\n \n3. Injection \n\u2022 If you feel unsure about the injection process, contact your doctor or pharmacist.  \n\u2022 Do not shake the medication. \n\u2022 Do not use the medication if it has been dropped after taking it out of the pack. \n\u2022 Turn on ava: \n\n\u2013 Press the  (On/Off button) for 1 second, or until the screen lights up and you hear \nsound \n\n\u2013 \u201cHello\u201d is displayed for 2 seconds - this means ava is switched on.  \n\uf0b7 ava then shows: \n\n\u2013 Your current dose and how often you need to inject it, \n\u2013 This is then followed by the message, \u201cInspect and then insert medication\u201d. \n\nCheck the medicine through the medication body.  \n\u2013 Do not use if the solution is discoloured, cloudy or there are particles in it. \n\u2013 You may see air bubbles - this is normal. Injecting a solution subcutaneously which \n\ncontains air bubbles is harmless. \n\nCheck that the red \u201cmedication level indicator\u201d is at the top of the cartridge.  \n\u2013 The medication contains 1ml of Cimzia and is not completely full - this is normal. \n\u2013 Do not remove the needle cap from the medication yet.  \n\n\n\n189 \n\n \n\uf0b7 Firmly push the flat end cap into the medication/injection port at the bottom of ava \u2013 push until \n\nyou hear a click.  \n\u2013 Do not twist the dose-dispenser cartridge - it is a special shape so that it fits correctly. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Let go of the needle cap \u2013 this allows ava to check if the medication is usable. Do not remove \n\nthe needle cap. \n\u2013 \u201cMedication accepted\u201d is shown if it is correct. \n\u2013 After a short pause, ava will automatically pull the cartridge in further. \n\n\uf0b7 The current injection speed (medication flow rate) is shown.  \n\u2013 You can change this speed using the \u201cscroll wheel\u201d on the side of your ava. \n\u2013 You can choose \u201cslowest\u201d, \u201cslow\u201d, \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cfastest\u201d - this controls how fast the \n\nmedicine will be injected and should be selected (and adjusted) as per your personal \ncomfort preference. Your doctor can provide advice. \n\n\uf0b7 \u201cRemove and save needle cap\u201d is shown.  \n\n\n\n190 \n\n\u2013 Only remove the needle cap when you are ready to inject.  \n\uf0b7 When ready, remove the needle cap by pulling it firmly downwards. \n\n\u2013 Once the needle cap has been removed, you must give the injection within 5 minutes. \nThere is no need to rush your injection - 5 minutes gives you enough time. The time left \nis shown on screen. \n\n\u2013 Keep the needle cap - you will need it to remove the used medication from ava later. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Find a comfortable position and sit down for your injection.  \n\n\u2013 Try to relax as this will make the injection more comfortable. \n\uf0b7 Place the orange skin sensor against the injection site where you are going to inject.  \n\n\u2013 Position ava at a right angle on your skin with the screen facing you. This will make sure \nyou are giving the injection correctly. \n\n\u2013 Position ava as shown so that you can comfortably reach the  (Start/Pause button) \nwithout moving ava.  \n\n \n\uf0b7 Once ava is placed firmly against your skin \u201cWhen ready press > once\u201d is shown. \n\n\uf0b7 Press the (Start/Pause button).  \n\u2013 As the injection is being given, keep holding ava firmly against your skin. \n\n\u2013 Avoid removing ava from the skin during the injection to ensure that you receive the full \ndose. \n\n\u2013 If ava is accidentally removed from your skin during the injection, the injection will \nautomatically stop and the needle will go back into ava. To complete your injection: \no Repeat Step 2 (Choosing and preparing an injection site), using a different injection \n\nsite  \no Press ava firmly against the skin to begin the injection again, then  \n\n\n\n191 \n\no Press the  (Start/Pause button). \n\uf0b7 If you feel unsure about the injection process, please contact your doctor or pharmacist. Do not \n\ntry to repeat the injection process without speaking to your doctor or your pharmacist. \n\uf0b7 When the injection is complete, a message is shown on ava's screen saying \"Injection complete. \n\nPlease remove from skin\" - you can then remove ava from you skin. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Use a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for a few seconds: \n\n\u2013 Do not rub the injection site. \n\u2013 You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if necessary. \n\n\uf0b7 The messages \u201cNeedle uncapped! Handle with care!\u201d and \u201cPlease replace needle cap\u201d are \nshown until the needle cap is put back on. \n\n\uf0b7 Replace the needle cap. \n\uf0b7 Let go of the needle cap so that ava can push out the used medication. \n\uf0b7 When \u201cRemove and discard used medication\u201d is shown, pull out the medication using the \n\nneedle cap. \n Check the red medication level indicator is at the bottom of the cartridge - this shows you have \n\nhad all of your injection. If the indicator is not at the bottom, contact your pharmacist. \n\n \n \n \n4. After Use \n\uf0b7 Do not re-use the cartridge \n\u2022 After injection, immediately throw away the used cartridge(s) in a special container as instructed \n\nby your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\u2022 Keep the container out of the sight and reach of children. \n\u2022 If you need to have a second injection as prescribed by your doctor: \n\n\u2013 The message \u201cYou have 1 injection left\u201d will be shown on screen. \n\n\n\n192 \n\n\u2013 Repeat the injection process starting at Step 2. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Store ava in the storage case after use. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what cimzia is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "cimzia contains the active substance certolizumab pegol, a human antibody fragment. antibodies are proteins that specifically recognise and bind to other proteins. cimzia binds to a specific protein called tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (tnf\u03b1). thereby this tnf\u03b1 is blocked by cimzia and this decreases inflammation diseases such as in rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. medicines that bind to tnf\u03b1 are also called tnf blockers. cimzia is used in adults for the following inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis), psoriatic arthritis plaque psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis cimzia is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. if you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other medicines usually methotrexate. if you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given cimzia in combination with methotrexate to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. if your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, cimzia can be given alone. cimzia in combination with methotrexate can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous use of methotrexate or other medicines. cimzia, which you will take in combination with methotrexate, is used to: reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease, improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis cimzia is used to treat severe active ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis (sometimes referred to as non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis). these diseases are inflammatory diseases of the spine. if you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. if you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given cimzia to: reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. psoriatic arthritis cimzia is used to treat active psoriatic arthritis. psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. if you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines, usually methotrexate. if you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given cimzia in combination with methotrexate to: reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, improve your physical function and performance of daily tasks. if your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate, cimzia can be given alone. plaque psoriasis cimzia is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin, and can also affect your scalp and nails. cimzia is used to reduce skin inflammation and other signs and symptoms of your disease.",

had or have a serious heart condition. warnings and precautions tell your doctor before treatment with cimzia if any of the following applies to you: allergic reactions - if you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash, stop using cimzia and contact your doctor immediately. some of these reactions could occur after the first administration of cimzia. - if you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. infections - if you have had recurrent or opportunistic infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections (such as treatment with immunosuppressants, which are medicines that could reduce your ability to fight infections). - if you have an infection or if you develop symptoms such as fever, wounds, tiredness or dental problems. you might get an infection more easily while you are being treated with cimzia, including serious, or in rare cases, life-threatening infections. - tuberculosis (tb) cases have been reported in patients treated with cimzia, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting cimzia. this will include a thorough medical history, a chest x-ray and a tuberculin test. the conduct of these tests should be recorded on your patient reminder card. if latent (inactive) tuberculosis is diagnosed, you might be required to receive appropriate anti-tuberculosis medicines before starting cimzia. in rare occasions tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventive 139 treatment for tuberculosis. it is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. if symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy with cimzia tell your doctor immediately. - if you are at risk of or are a carrier of or have active hepatitis b virus

appear during or after therapy with cimzia or existing skin lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. - there have been cases of cancers, including unusual types, in children and teenage patients taking tnf-blocking agents, which sometimes resulted in death (see further down \"children and adolescents\"). other disorders - patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), or who are heavy smokers, may be at increased risk for cancer with cimzia treatment. if you have copd or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a tnf blocker is appropriate for you. - if you have a nervous system disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide whether you should use cimzia. - in some patients the body may fail to produce enough

the skin is reddened, bruised, or hard. instructions for self-injecting cimzia after suitable training, your doctor may also allow you to inject cimzia yourself. please read the instructions at the end of this leaflet on how to inject cimzia. if your doctor has allowed you to self-inject, you should follow up with your doctor before you continue to self-inject: after 12 weeks if you have rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis or psoriatic arthritis, or after 16 weeks if you have plaque psoriasis. this is so that the doctor can determine if cimzia is working for you or if another treatment needs to be considered. if you use more cimzia than you should if your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you accidentally inject cimzia more frequently than prescribed, you should tell your doctor. always take the patient reminder card and the outer carton from the cimzia package with you, even if it is empty. if you forget to use cimzia if your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you forget to give yourself an injection, you should inject the next dose of cimzia as soon as you remember. then, talk to your doctor and inject the following doses as instructed. if you stop using cimzia do not stop using cimzia without talking to your doctor first. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.",
