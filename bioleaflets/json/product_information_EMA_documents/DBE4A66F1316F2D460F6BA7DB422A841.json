PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nTablet \n \nPioglitazone Accord 15 mg tablets \nThe tablets are white to off white, round, biconvex, uncoated tablets debossed with ‘P’ on one side and \n‘15’ on other side. \n \nPioglitazone Accord 30 mg tablets \nThe tablets are white to off white, flat, round uncoated tablets with beveled edges debossed with ‘PIO’ \non one side and ‘30’ on the other side. \n \nPioglitazone Accord 45 mg tablets \nThe tablets are white to off white, flat, round uncoated tablets with beveled edges debossed with ‘PIO’ \non one side and ‘45’ on the other side. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPioglitazone is indicated as second or third line  treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as described \nbelow: \n\n \nas monotherapy \n- in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and \n\nexercise for whom metformin is in appropriate because of contraindications or \nintolerance \n\n \nas dual oral therapy in combination with  \n\n - metformin, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic control \ndespite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin  \n\n \n - a sulphonylurea, only in adult patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is \n\ncontraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy \nwith a sulphonylurea.  \n\n \nas triple oral therapy in combination with  \n\n - metformin and a sulphonylurea, in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient \nglycaemic control despite dual oral therapy.  \n\n \nPioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus adult \npatients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate \nbecause of contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4). \n \nAfter initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess \nadequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an adequate \nresponse, pioglitazone should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged therapy, \nprescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of pioglitazone is maintained \n(see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPioglitazone treatment may be initiated at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The dose may be increased in \nincrements up to 45 mg once daily. \n \nIn combination with insulin, the current insulin dose can be continued upon initiation of pioglitazone \ntherapy. If patients report hypoglycaemia, the dose of insulin should be decreased. \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Physicians should start treatment \nwith the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually, particularly when pioglitazone is used \nin combination with insulin (see section 4.4 Fluid retention and cardiac failure). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine \nclearance > 4 ml/min) (see section 5.2). No information is available from dialysed patients therefore \npioglitazone should not be used in such patients. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Pioglitazone Accord in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have \nnot been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPioglitazone tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food. Tablets should be swallowed \nwith a glass of water. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nPioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with: \n \n- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in 6.1 \n- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA stages I to IV) \n- hepatic impairment \n- diabetic ketoacidosis \n- current bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer  \n- uninvestigated macroscopic haematuria \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFluid retention and cardiac failure \n \nPioglitazone can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure. When \ntreating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure (e.g. \nprior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease or the elderly), physicians should \nstart with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually. Patients should be observed for \nsigns and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema; particularly those with reduced cardiac \nreserve. There have been post-marketing cases of cardiac failure reported when pioglitazone was used \nin combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure. Patients should be observed \nfor signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in \ncombination with insulin. Since insulin and pioglitazone are both associated with fluid retention, \nconcomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. Post marketing cases of peripheral \noedema and cardiac failure have also been reported in patients with concomitant use of pioglitazone \nand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Pioglitazone should \nbe discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs. \n \nA cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease. Pioglitazone or placebo was \nadded to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years. This study showed an \nincrease in reports of heart failure, however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.  \n \nElderly \n \nCombination use with insulin should be considered with caution in the elderly because of increased \nrisk of serious heart failure. \n \nIn light of age- related risks (especially bladder cancer, fractures and heart failure), the balance of \nbenefits and risks should be considered carefully both before and during treatment in the elderly. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nBladder cancer \n \nCases of bladder cancer were reported more frequently in a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials \nwith pioglitazone (19 cases from 12506 patients, 0.15%) than in control groups (7 cases from \n10212 patients, 0.07%) HR=2.64 (95% CI 1.11-6.31, P=0.029). After excluding patients in whom \nexposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 7 \ncases (0.06%) on pioglitazone and 2 cases (0.02%) in control groups. Epidemiological studies have \nalso suggested a small increased risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone, \nalthough not all studies identified a statistically significant increased risk. \n \nRisk factors for bladder cancer should be assessed before initiating pioglitazone treatment (risks \ninclude age, smoking history, exposure to some occupational or chemotherapy agents \ne.g. cyclophosphamide or prior radiation treatment in the pelvic region). Any macroscopic haematuria \nshould be investigated before starting pioglitazone therapy.  \n \nPatients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if macroscopic haematuria \nor other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment. \n \nMonitoring of liver function \n \nThere have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience (see \nsection 4.8). It is recommended, therefore, that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic \nmonitoring of liver enzymes. Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with \npioglitazone in all patients. Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased \nbaseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver \ndisease.  \n \nFollowing initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored \nperiodically based on clinical judgement. If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal \nduring pioglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT \nlevels remain > 3 X the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued. If any patient develops \nsymptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision \nwhether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement \npending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, the medicinal product should be discontinued. \n \nWeight gain \n \nIn clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due to \nfat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention. In some cases weight increase may \nbe a symptom of cardiac failure, therefore weight should be closely monitored. Part of the treatment of \ndiabetes is dietary control. Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie-controlled diet. \n \nHaematology \n \nThere was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin (4% relative reduction) and haematocrit (4.1% \nrelative reduction) during therapy with pioglitazone, consistent with haemodilution. Similar changes \nwere seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3-4% and haematocrit 3.6–4.1% relative reductions) and to a \nlesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin (haemoglobin 1–2% and haematocrit 1–3.2% relative \nreductions) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone. \n \nHypoglycaemia  \n \nAs a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral \ntherapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related \nhypoglycaemia, and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nEye disorders  \n \nPost-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual \nacuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone. Many of these patients \nreported concurrent peripheral oedema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association \nbetween pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular \noedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should \nbe considered. \n \nOthers \n \nAn increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse reactions \nof bone fracture from randomised, controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and \n7400 comparator treated patients, on treatment for up to 3.5 years. \n \nFractures were observed in 2.6% of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7% of women treated \nwith a comparator. No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) \nversus comparator (1.5%). \n \nThe fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with \npioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator. The observed \nexcess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per \n100 patient years of use. \n \nIn the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) \nof pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures \nper 100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator. No increase in fracture rates was \nobserved in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). \n \nSome epidemiological studies have suggested a similarly increased risk of fracture in both men and \nwomen. \n \nThe risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of patients treated with pioglitazone \n(see section 4.8). \n \nAs a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic \novarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation. These patients may be at risk of pregnancy. \nPatients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if \npregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6). \n \nPioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 \ninhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Glycaemic control should be monitored \nclosely. Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nPioglitazone Accord tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to \npatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics \nor pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Co-administration of \npioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea. \nStudies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450, 1A, 2C8/9 and 3A4. In \nvitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450. Interactions with \n\n\n\n7 \n\nsubstances metabolised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel \nblockers, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.  \n \nCo-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported \nto result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone. Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-\nrelated adverse events, a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is \nconcomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section \n4.4). Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is \nreported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone. The pioglitazone dose may need to be \nincreased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control \nshould be considered (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate human data to determine the safety of pioglitazone during pregnancy. Foetal \ngrowth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone. This was attributable to the action \nof pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that \noccurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth. \nThe relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used in \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nPioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether \npioglitazone is secreted in human milk. Therefore, pioglitazone should not be administered to breast-\nfeeding women. \n \nFertility \n \nIn animal fertility studies there was no effect on copulation, impregnation or fertility index. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nPioglitazone Accord has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria.  \n \n2 Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood \nglucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other \nhypoglycaemic treatments. \n \n \n3 In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was \nthe same as in placebo, metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups, but was increased when used \nin combination therapy with insulin. In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major \nmacrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than \nwith placebo, when added to therapy that included insulin. However, this did not lead to an increase in \nmortality in this study. In this study in patients receiving pioglitazone and insulin, a higher percentage \nof patients with heart failure was observed in patients  aged ≥65 years compared with those less than \n65 years (9.7% compared to 4.0%). In patients on insulin with no pioglitazone the incidence of heart \nfailure was 8.2% in those ≥65 years compared to 4.0% in patients less than 65 years. Heart failure has \nbeen reported with marketing use of pioglitazone, and more frequently when pioglitazone was used in \ncombination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure. \n \n4 A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse reactions of bone fractures from randomised, comparator \ncontrolled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and \n7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration. A higher rate of fractures was \nobserved in women taking pioglitazone (2.6%) versus comparator (1.7%). No increase in fracture rates \nwas observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) versus comparator (1.5%). \nIn the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced \nfractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%) of female patients treated with comparator. No increase in \nfracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). Post-\nmarketing, bone fractures have been reported in both male and female patients (see section 4.4). \n \n5 Oedema was reported in 6-9% of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled \nclinical trials. The oedema rates for comparator groups (sulphonylurea, metformin) were 2-5%. The \n\n\n\n10 \n\nreports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of \ntreatment. \n \n6 In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy \nwas 2–3 kg over one year. This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group. In \ncombination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of \n1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg. In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to \nmetformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a \nmean weight loss of 1.0 kg. \n \n7 In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the \nupper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea \ncomparator groups. Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone. Rare \ncases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing \nexperience. Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported, causal relationship has not \nbeen established. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical studies, patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of \n45 mg daily. The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/day for four days, then 180 mg/day for seven \ndays was not associated with any symptoms. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin. Symptomatic and general \nsupportive measures should be taken in case of overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins; \nATC code: A10BG03. \n \nPioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance. Pioglitazone appears to act \nvia activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) leading \nto increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals. Treatment with \npioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose \ndisposal in the case of insulin resistance. \n \nFasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The \nimproved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma \ninsulin concentrations. A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to \ntwo years in order to assess time to treatment failure (defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the \nfirst six months of therapy). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients \ntreated with gliclazide, compared with pioglitazone. At two years, glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c \n< 8.0%) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 50% of patients on \ngliclazide. In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when \nadded to metformin, glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar \nbetween treatment groups after one year. The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during the second year \nwas less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide.  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nIn a placebo controlled trial, patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin \noptimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months. Patients receiving \npioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45% compared with those continuing on insulin \nalone, and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group. \n \nHOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin \nsensitivity. Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect. \n \nIn one year clinical trials, pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the \nalbumin/creatinine ratio compared to baseline. \n \nThe effect of pioglitazone (45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was studied in a small 18-week trial in \ntype 2 diabetics. Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain. Visceral fat was \nsignificantly decreased, while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass. Similar changes in \nbody fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity. \nIn most clinical trials, reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL-\ncholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small, but not clinically significant \nincreases in LDL-cholesterol levels.   \n \nIn clinical trials of up to two years duration, pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free \nfatty acids, and increased HDL cholesterol levels, compared with placebo, metformin or gliclazide. \nPioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with \nplacebo, whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide. In a 20-week study, as well \nas reducing fasting triglycerides, pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an \neffect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides. These effects were independent of \npioglitazone’s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significantly different to glibenclamide. \n \nIn PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-\nexisting major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to \nexisting antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years. The study population had an \naverage age of 62 years; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years. Approximately one third of \npatients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea. To be eligible \npatients had to have had one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous \ncardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, \nor peripheral arterial obstructive disease. Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial \ninfarction and approximately 20% had had a stroke. Approximately half of the study population had at \nleast two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria. Almost all subjects (95%) were receiving \ncardiovascular medicinal products (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium \nchannel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, fibrates). \n \nAlthough the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause \nmortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, \ncoronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term \ncardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone. However, the incidences of oedema, weight \ngain and heart failure were increased. No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nPioglitazone  in all subsets of the paediatric population in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. See section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of \nunchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration. Proportional increases of the \nplasma concentration were observed for doses from 2–60 mg. Steady state is achieved after  \n4–7 days of dosing. Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites. \nAbsorption is not influenced by food intake. Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80%. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l/kg. \n \nPioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein (> 99%). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups. \nThis is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser \ndegree. Three of the six identified metabolites are active (M-II, M-III, and M-IV). When activity, \nconcentrations and protein binding are taken into account, pioglitazone and metabolite M-III \ncontribute equally to efficacy. On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold \nthat of pioglitazone, whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450. \nThere is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A, 2C8/9, and 3A4 in man. \n \nInteraction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics \nor pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin. Concomitant \nadministration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with \nrifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the \nplasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man, recovered label was mainly in \nfaeces (55%) and a lesser amount in urine (45%). In animals, only a small amount of unchanged \npioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces. The mean plasma elimination half-life of \nunchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours.  \n \nElderly \n \nSteady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment, plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower \nthan those seen in subjects with normal renal function, but oral clearance of parent substance is similar. \nThus free (unbound) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n \nTotal plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged, but with an increased volume of distribution. \nIntrinsic clearance is therefore reduced, coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn toxicology studies, plasma volume expansion with haemodilution, anaemia, and reversible eccentric \ncardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. \nIn addition, increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed. These findings were observed across \nspecies at plasma concentrations  4 times the clinical exposure. Foetal growth restriction was apparent \nin animal studies with pioglitazone. This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing \nthe maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby \nreducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.  \n \nPioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro \ngenotoxicity assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and females) and tumours (males) \nof the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years.  \n \nThe formation and presence of urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was \npostulated as the mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response in the male rat. A \n24-month mechanistic study in male rats demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted in \nan increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder. Dietary acidification significantly \ndecreased but did not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of microcrystals exacerbated the \nhyperplastic response but was not considered to be the primary cause of hyperplastic changes. The \nrelevance to humans of the tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded. \n \nThere was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex. Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not \nseen in dogs or monkeys treated with pioglitazone for up to 12 months. \n \nIn an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other \nthiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon. The relevance of this finding is \nunknown. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA):  \nNo environmental impact is anticipated from the clinical use of pioglitazone. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Pioglitazone Accord is and what it is used for \n \nPioglitazone Accord contains pioglitazone. It is an anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 (non-\ninsulin dependent) diabetes mellitus in adults, when metformin is not suitable or has failed to work \nadequately. This is the diabetes that usually develops in adulthood. \n \nPioglitazone Accord helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by \nhelping your body make better use of the insulin it produces. Your doctor will check whether \nPioglitazone Accord is working 3 to 6 months after you start taking it. \n \nPioglitazone Accord may be used on its own in patients who are unable to take metformin, and where \ntreatment with diet and exercise has failed to control blood sugar or may be added to other therapies \n(such as metformin, sulfonylurea or insulin) which have failed to provide sufficient control of blood \nsugar. \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Pioglitazone Accord \n \nDo not take Pioglitazone Accord:  \n if you are allergic to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in Section \n\n6). \n if you have heart failure or have had heart failure in the past.  \n if you have liver disease.  \n if you have had diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes causing rapid weight loss, nausea   \n\n   or vomiting). \n if you have or have ever had bladder cancer. \n if you have blood in your urine that your doctor has not checked. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Pioglitazone Accord (also see Section 4) \n\n\n\n34 \n\n if you retain water (fluid retention) or have heart failure problems, in particular if you are over \n75 years old. If you take anti-inflammatory medicines which can also cause fluid retention and \nswelling, you must also tell your doctor. \n\n if you have a special type of diabetic eye disease called macular oedema (swelling of the back of  \n the eye). \n if you have cysts on your ovaries (polycystic ovary syndrome). There may be an increased \n\npossibility of becoming pregnant because you may ovulate again when you take Pioglitazone \nAccord. If this applies to you, use appropriate contraception to avoid the possibility of an \nunplanned pregnancy.  \n\n If you have a problem with your liver or heart. Before you start taking Pioglitazone Accord you \nwill have a blood sample taken to check your liver function. This check may be repeated at \nintervals. Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or \nprevious stroke who were treated with Pioglitazone Accord and insulin experienced the \ndevelopment of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of \nheart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling \n(oedema). \n\n \nIf you take Pioglitazone Accord with other medicines for diabetes, it is more likely that your blood \nsugar could fall below the normal level (hypoglycaemia).  \n \nYou may also experience a reduction in blood count (anaemia).  \n \nBroken bones \nA higher number of bone fractures was seen in patients, particularly women taking pioglitazone. Your \ndoctor will take this into account when treating your diabetes. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Pioglitazone Accord \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking,have recently taken or might take any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nYou can usually continue to take other medicines whilst you are being treated with Pioglitazone \nAccord. However, certain medicines are especially likely to affect the amount of sugar in your blood:  \n- gemfibrozil (used to lower cholesterol)  \n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis and other infections)  \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your blood sugar will be checked, and  \nyour dose of Pioglitazone Accord may need to be changed. \n \nPioglitazone Accord with food and drink \nYou may take your tablets with or without food. You should swallow the tablets with a glass of water. \n \nPregnancy and breastfeeding \nTell your doctor if  \n- you are, you think you might be or are planning to become pregnant.  \n- you are breast-feeding or if you are planning to breast-feed your baby.  \nYour doctor will advise you to discontinue this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine will not affect your ability to drive or use machines but take care if you experience \nabnormal vision. \n \nPioglitazone Accord contains lactose monohydrate   \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking Pioglitazone Accord. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n   \n \n3.
