PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection).\nClear, colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRetacrit is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure \n(CRF):\no in adults and paediatrics aged 1 to 18 years on haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal \n\ndialysis (see section 4.4).  \no in adults with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis for the treatment of severe anaemia \n\nof renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in patients (see section 4.4).  \n\nRetacrit is indicated in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or \nmultiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e.g. \ncardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy) for the treatment of anaemia \nand reduction of transfusion requirements. \n\nRetacrit is indicated in adults in a predonation programme to increase the yield of autologous blood. \nTreatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] concentration \nrange between 10 to 13 g/dL [6.2 to 8.1 mmol/L], no iron deficiency) if blood saving procedures are \nnot available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of \nblood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males). \n\nRetacrit is indicated for non-iron deficient adults prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery having a \nhigh perceived risk for transfusion complications to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions. \nUse should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin concentration range \nbetween 10 to 13 g/dL or 6.2 to 8.1 mmol/L) who do not have an autologous predonation programme \navailable and with expected moderate blood loss (900 to 1 800 mL). \n\nRetacrit is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia (haemoglobin concentration of \u226410 \ng/dL) in adults with low- or intermediate-1-risk primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who have \nlow serum erythropoietin (<200 mU/mL).\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Retacrit has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the \nmanagement of patients with above indications.\n\nPosology\n\nAll other causes of anaemia (iron, folate or Vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection \nor inflammation, blood loss, haemolysis and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin) should be evaluated \nand treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin zeta, and when deciding to increase the dose. In \norder to ensure optimum response to epoetin zeta, adequate iron stores should be assured and iron \nsupplementation should be administered if necessary (see section 4.4).\n\nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult chronic renal failure patients\n\nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender and co-morbid medical conditions; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary. \n\nThe recommended desired haemoglobin concentration range is between 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL (6.2 to \n7.5 mmol/L). Retacrit should be administered in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than \n12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L). A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) over a four week \nperiod should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.\n\nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin concentration range may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should \nbe addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin concentration range \nof 10 g/dL (6.2 mmol/L) to 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L). \n\nA sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) should be avoided. If the\nhaemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin \nexceeds 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) reduce the Retacrit dose by 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/dL \n(8.1 mmol/L), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) and then reinstitute \nRetacrit therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.\n\nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved effective dose of Retacrit is \nused to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia whilst maintaining a \nhaemoglobin concentration below or at 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L).\n\nCaution should be exercised with escalation of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) doses in \npatients with chronic renal failure. In patients with a poor haemoglobin response to ESA, alternative \nexplanations for the poor response should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nTreatment with Retacrit is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase.\n\nAdult haemodialysis patients\n\nIn patients on haemodialysis where intravenous access is readily available, administration by the \nintravenous route is preferable.\n\nCorrection phase\n\nThe starting dose is 50 IU/kg, 3 times per week.\n\nIf necessary, increase or decrease the dose by 25 IU/kg (3 times per week) until the desired \nhaemoglobin concentration range between 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL (6.2 to 7.5 mmol/L) is achieved (this \nshould be done in steps of at least four weeks). \n\n\n\n6\n\nMaintenance phase\n\nThe recommended total weekly dose is between 75 IU/kg and 300 IU/kg.\n\nAppropriate adjustment of the dose should be made in order to maintain haemoglobin values within\nthe desired concentration range between 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL (6.2 to 7.5 mmol/L). \n\nPatients with very low initial haemoglobin (<6 g/dL or <3.75 mmol/L) may require higher \nmaintenance doses than patients whose initial anaemia is less severe (>8 g/dL or >5 mmol/L). \n\nAdult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis\n\nWhere intravenous access is not readily available Retacrit may be administered subcutaneously.\n\nCorrection phase\n\nStarting dose of 50 IU/kg, 3 times per week, followed if necessary by a dosage increase with 25 IU/kg \nincrements (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at \nleast four weeks).\n\nMaintenance phase\n\nDuring the maintenance phase, Retacrit can be administered either 3 times per week, and in the case of \nsubcutaneous administration, once weekly or once every 2 weeks. \n\nAppropriate adjustment of dose and dose intervals should be made in order to maintain haemoglobin \nvalues at the desired level: haemoglobin between 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL (6.2 to 7.5 mmol/L). Extending \ndose intervals may require an increase in dose.\n\nThe maximum dosage should not exceed 150 IU/kg 3 times per week, 240 IU/kg (up to a maximum of \n20 000 IU) once weekly, or 480 IU/kg (up to a maximum of 40 000 IU) once every 2 weeks.\n\nAdult peritoneal dialysis patients\n\nWhere intravenous access is not readily available Retacrit may be administered subcutaneously.\n\nCorrection phase\n\nThe starting dose is 50 IU/kg, 2 times per week. \n\nMaintenance phase\n\nThe recommended maintenance dose is between 25 IU/kg and 50 IU/kg, 2 times per week in 2 equal \ninjections. \n\nAppropriate adjustment of the dose should be made in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the \ndesired level between 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL (6.2 to 7.5 mmol/L).\n\nTreatment of adult patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia \n\nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u00b4s evaluation of the individual patient\u00b4s clinical course and condition is necessary.\n\nRetacrit should be administered to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin concentration \u2264 10 g/dL\n[6.2 mmol/L]).\n\nThe initial dose is 150 IU/kg subcutaneously, 3 times per week.\n\n\n\n7\n\nAlternatively, Retacrit can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/kg subcutaneously once \nweekly.\n\nAppropriate adjustment of the dose should be made in order to maintain haemoglobin concentrations \nwithin the desired concentration range between 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL (6.2 to 7.5 mmol/L).\n\nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin concentrations for a patient above \nand below the desired haemoglobin concentration range may be observed. Haemoglobin variability \nshould be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the desired haemoglobin \nconcentration range between 10 g/dL (6.2 mmol/L) to 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L). A sustained \nhaemoglobin concentration of greater than 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) should be avoided; guidance for \nappropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin concentrations exceed 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) are \ndescribed below.\n\uf02d If the haemoglobin concentration has increased by at least 1 g/dL (0.62 mmol/L) or the \n\nreticulocyte count has increased \u2265 40 000 cells/\u00b5L above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, \nthe dose should remain at 150 IU/kg 3 times per week or 450 IU/kg once weekly. \n\n\uf02d If the haemoglobin concentration increase is <1 g/dL (<0.62 mmol/L) and the reticulocyte count \nhas increased <40 000 cells/\u00b5l above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/kg 3 times per week. \nIf after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin\nconcentration has increased \u2265 1 g/dL (\u22650.62 mmol/L) or the reticulocyte count has increased \n\u226540 000 cells/\u00b5l, the dose should remain at 300 IU/kg 3 times per week. \n\n\uf02d If the haemoglobin concentration has increased <1 g/dL (<0.62 mmol/L) and the reticulocyte \ncount has increased <40 000 cells/\u00b5L above baseline, response is unlikely and treatment should \nbe discontinued. \n\nDose adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentrations between 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL (6.2 to \n7.5 mmol/L)\n\nIf the haemoglobin concentration is increasing by more than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) per month, or if the \nhaemoglobin concentration level exceeds 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L), reduce the Retacrit dose by about \n25 to 50%.\n\nIf the haemoglobin concentration level exceeds 13 g/dL (8.1 mmol/L), discontinue therapy until it falls \nbelow 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) and then reinitiate Retacrit therapy at a dose 25% below the previous \ndose.\n\n\n\n8\n\nThe recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram*:\n\n*1 g/dL = 0.62 mmol/L; 12 g/dL = 7.5 mmol/L\n\nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of ESA is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.\n\nRetacrit therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.\n\nTreatment of adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme \n\nMildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 to 39%) requiring predeposit of \u2265 4 units of blood should \nbe treated with Retacrit 600 IU/kg intravenously, 2 times per week for 3 weeks prior to surgery. \nRetacrit should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.\n\nTreatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery\n\nThe recommended dose is Retacrit 600 IU/kg administered subcutaneously weekly for three weeks \n(days -21, -14 and -7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery. \n\nIn cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, \nRetacrit 300 IU/kg should be administered subcutaneously daily for 10 consecutive days prior to \nsurgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter. \n\nIf the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/dL (9.38 mmol/L), or higher, during the preoperative period, \nadministration of Retacrit should be stopped and further dosages should not be administered. \n\nTreatment of adult patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS\n\nRetacrit should be administered to patients with symptomatic anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u226410 g/dL (6.2 mmol/L)).\n\nThe recommended starting dose is Retacrit 450 IU/kg (maximum total dose is 40 000 IU) administered\nsubcutaneously once every week, with not less than 5 days between doses.\n\nAppropriate dose adjustments should be made to maintain haemoglobin concentrations within the \ntarget range of 10 g/dL to 12 g/dL (6.2 to 7.5 mmol/L). It is recommended that initial erythroid \n\n\n\n9\n\nresponse be assessed 8 to 12 weeks following initiation of treatment. Dose increases and decreases \nshould be done one dosing step at a time (see diagram below). A haemoglobin concentration of greater \nthan 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) should be avoided.\n\nDose increase\n\nDose should not be increased over the maximum of 1 050 IU/kg (total dose 80 000 IU) per week. If \nthe patient loses response or haemoglobin concentration drops by \u22651 g/dL upon dose reduction the \ndose should be increased by one dosing step. A minimum of 4 weeks should elapse between dose \nincreases.\n\nDose hold and decrease\n\nEpoetin zeta should be withheld when the haemoglobin concentration exceeds 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L). \nOnce the haemoglobin level is <11 g/dL the dose can be restarted on the same dosing step or one \ndosing step down based on physician judgement. Decreasing the dose by one dosing step should be \nconsidered if there is a rapid increase in haemoglobin (>2 g/dL over 4 weeks).\n\nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and co-morbid medical conditions; a \nphysician's evaluation of the individual patient's clinical course and condition is necessary.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in chronic renal failure patients on haemodialysis\n\nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and co-morbid medical conditions; a \nphysician's evaluation of the individual patient's clinical course and condition is necessary.\n\nIn paediatric patients the recommended haemoglobin concentration range is between 9.5 g/dL to \n11 g/dL (5.9 to 6.8 mmol/L). Retacrit should be administered in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 11 g/dL (6.8 mmol/L). A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) over a \nfour week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as \nprovided.\n\nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Retacrit is used to \nprovide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.\n\nTreatment with Retacrit is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase.\n\nIn paediatric patients on haemodialysis where intravenous access is readily available, administration \nby the intravenous route is preferable.\n\nCorrection phase\n\nThe starting dose is 50 IU/kg intravenously, 3 times per week.\n\n\n\n10\n\nIf necessary, increase or decrease the dose by 25 IU/kg (3 times per week) until the desired \nhaemoglobin concentration range of between 9.5 g/dL to 11 g/dL (5.9 to 6.8 mmol/L) is achieved (this \nshould be done in steps of at least four weeks).\n\nMaintenance phase \n\nAppropriate adjustment of the dose should be made in order to maintain haemoglobin levels within the \ndesired concentration range between 9.5 g/dL to 11 g/dL (5.9 to 6.8 mmol/L).\n\nGenerally, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults. \nThe following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment.\n\nDose (IU/kg given 3 times per week)\n\nWeight (kg) Median Usual maintenance dose\n\n<10 100 75-150\n\n10-30 75 60-150\n\n>30 33 30-100\n\nPaediatric patients with very low initial haemoglobin (<6.8 g/dL or <4.25 mmol/L) may require higher \nmaintenance doses than patients whose initial haemoglobin is higher (>6.8 g/dL or >4.25 mmol/L).\n\nAnaemia in chronic renal failure patients before initiation of dialysis or on peritoneal dialysis\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Retacrit in chronic renal failure patients with anaemia before initiation of \ndialysis or on peritoneal dialysis have not been established. Currently available data for subcutaneous \nuse of epoetin alfa in these populations are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on \nposology can be made.\n\nTreatment of paediatric patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of epoetin alfa in paediatric patients receiving chemotherapy have not been \nestablished (see section 5.1).\n\nTreatment of paediatric surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of epoetin alfa in paediatrics have not been established. No data are available.\n\nTreatment of paediatric patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of epoetin alfa in paediatrics have not been established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product.\n\nBefore use, leave the Retacrit syringe to stand until it reaches room temperature. This usually takes \nbetween 15 and 30 minutes.\n\nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult chronic renal failure patients  \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure where intravenous access is routinely available (haemodialysis \npatients) administration of Retacrit by the intravenous route is preferable.\n\nWhere intravenous access is not readily available (patients not yet undergoing dialysis and peritoneal \ndialysis patients) Retacrit may be administered as a subcutaneous injection.\n\n\n\n11\n\nTreatment of adult patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia  \n\nRetacrit should be administered as a subcutaneous injection.\n\nTreatment of adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme  \n\nRetacrit should be administered by the intravenous route.\n\nTreatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery  \n\nRetacrit should be administered as a subcutaneous injection. \n\nTreatment of adult patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS\n\nRetacrit should be administered as a subcutaneous injection.\n\nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in paediatric chronic renal failure patients on haemodialysis  \n\nIn paediatric patients with chronic renal failure where intravenous access is routinely available \n(haemodialysis patients) administration of Retacrit by the intravenous route is preferable.\n\nIntravenous administration\n\nAdminister over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose. In haemodialysed patients, a \nbolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis \nline. Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle \ntubing, followed by 10 mL of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the \nproduct into the circulation (see Posology, Adult haemodialysis patients).\n\nA slower administration is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms \n(see section 4.8).\n\nDo not administer Retacrit by intravenous infusion or in conjunction with other medicinal product\nsolutions (please refer to section 6.6 for further information).\n\nSubcutaneous administration  \n\nA maximum volume of 1 mL at one injection site should generally not be exceeded. In case of larger \nvolumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.\n\nThe injections should be given in the limbs or the anterior abdominal wall.\n\nIn those situations in which the physician determines that a patient or caregiver can safely and \neffectively administer Retacrit subcutaneously themselves, instruction as to the proper dosage and \nadministration should be provided.\n\nAs with any other injectable product, check that there are no particles in the solution or change in \ncolour. \n\n\u201cInstructions on how to inject Retacrit yourself\u201d can be found at the end of the package leaflet.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n\n\n12\n\nPatients who develop pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should\nnot receive Retacrit or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4).\n\nUncontrolled hypertension.\n\nAll contraindications associated with autologous blood predonation programmes should be respected \nin patients being supplemented with Retacrit.\n\nThe use of Retacrit in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating \nin an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, \nperipheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial \ninfarction or cerebral vascular accident.\n\nSurgery patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nGeneral\n\nIn all patients receiving epoetin zeta, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as \nnecessary. Epoetin zeta should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated \nor poorly controllable hypertension. It may be necessary to add or increase anti-hypertensive \ntreatment. If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin zeta treatment should be discontinued. \n\nHypertensive crisis with encephalopathy and seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician \nand intensive medical care, have occurred also during epoetin zeta treatment in patients with \npreviously normal or low blood pressure. Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing \nmigraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal (see section 4.8).\n\nEpoetin zeta should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy, history of seizures, or medical \nconditions associated with a predisposition to seizure activity such as CNS infections and brain \nmetastases. \n\nEpoetin zeta should be used with caution in patients with chronic liver failure. The safety of epoetin \nzeta has not been established in patients with hepatic dysfunction.\n\nAn increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in patients receiving \nESAs (see section 4.8). These include venous and arterial thrombosis and embolism (including some \nwith fatal outcomes), such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, retinal thrombosis, and \nmyocardial infarction. Additionally, cerebrovascular accidents (including cerebral infarction, cerebral \nhaemorrhage and transient ischaemic attacks) have been reported.\n\nThe reported risk of these TVEs should be carefully weighed against the benefits to be derived from \ntreatment with epoetin zeta particularly in patients with pre-existing risk factors for TVE, including \nobesity and prior history of TVEs (e.g., deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and cerebral \nvascular accident).\n\nIn all patients, haemoglobin levels should be closely monitored due to a potential increased risk of \nthromboembolic events and fatal outcomes when patients are treated at haemoglobin levels above the \nconcentration range for the indication of use.\n\n\n\n13\n\nThere may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during \ntreatment with epoetin zeta. This regresses during the course of continued therapy. In addition, \nthrombocythaemia above the normal range has been reported. It is recommended that the platelet \ncount is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy. \n\nAll other causes of anaemia (iron, folate or Vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection \nor inflammation, blood loss, haemolysis and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin) should be evaluated\nand treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin zeta, and when deciding to increase the dose. In \nmost cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume. In \norder to ensure optimum response to epoetin zeta, adequate iron stores should be assured and iron \nsupplementation should be administered if necessary (see section 4.2): \n\n\uf02d For chronic renal failure patients, iron supplementation (elemental iron 200 to 300 mg/day \norally for adults and 100 to 200 mg/day orally for paediatrics) is recommended if serum ferritin \nlevels are below 100 ng/mL.\n\n\uf02d For cancer patients, iron supplementation (elemental iron 200 to 300 mg/day orally) is \nrecommended if transferrin saturation is below 20%.\n\n\uf02d For patients in an autologous predonation programme, iron supplementation (elemental iron \n200 mg/day orally) should be administered several weeks prior to initiating the autologous \npredeposit in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting epoetin zeta therapy, and \nthroughout the course of epoetin zeta therapy.\n\n\uf02d For patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, iron supplementation (elemental \niron 200 mg/day orally) should be administered throughout the course of epoetin zeta therapy. If \npossible, iron supplementation should be initiated prior to starting epoetin zeta therapy to \nachieve adequate iron stores.\n\nVery rarely, development of or exacerbation of porphyria has been observed in epoetin zeta-treated \npatients. Epoetin zeta should be used with caution in patients with porphyria. \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in association \nwith epoetin treatment. More severe cases have been observed with long-acting epoetins.\n\nAt the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored \nclosely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, Retacrit should \nbe withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered.\n\nIf the patient has developed a severe cutaneous skin reaction such as SJS or TEN due to the use of \nRetacrit, treatment with Retacrit must not be restarted in this patient at any time.\n\nPatients should only be switched from one ESA to another under appropriate supervision.\n\nPure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA)\n\nAntibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment\nwith epoetins. Cases have also been reported in patients with hepatitis C treated with interferon and \nribavirin, when ESAs are used concomitantly. Epoetin zeta is not approved in the management of \nanaemia associated with hepatitis C.\n\nIn patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/dL per \nmonth) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical \ncauses of non-response (e.g. iron, folate or Vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection \nor inflammation, blood loss, haemolysis and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin) should be \ninvestigated.\n\n\n\n14\n\nA paradoxical decrease in haemoglobin and development of severe anaemia associated with low \nreticulocyte counts should prompt to discontinue treatment with epoetin zeta and perform \nanti-erythropoietin antibody testing. A bone marrow examination should also be considered for \ndiagnosis of PRCA.\n\nNo other ESA therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.\n\nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients\n\nChronic renal failure patients being treated with epoetin zeta should have haemoglobin levels \nmeasured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved, and periodically thereafter.\n\nIn chronic renal failure patients the rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/dL \n(0.62 mmol/L) per month and should not exceed 2 g/dL (1.25 mmol/L) per month to minimise risks of\nan increase in hypertension.\n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the haemoglobin concentration range as recommended in section 4.2. In clinical trials, \nan increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when ESAs were \nadministered to achieve a haemoglobin concentration level of greater than 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L).\n\nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.\n\nCaution should be exercised with escalation of Retacrit doses in patients with chronic renal failure\nsince high cumulative epoetin doses may be associated with an increased risk of mortality, serious \ncardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. In patients with a poor haemoglobin response to epoetins, \nalternative explanations for the poor response should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nChronic renal failure patients treated with epoetin zeta by the subcutaneous route should be monitored \nregularly for loss of efficacy, defined as absent or decreased response to epoetin zeta treatment in \npatients who previously responded to such therapy. This is characterised by a sustained decrease in \nhaemoglobin despite an increase in epoetin zeta dosage (see section 4.8).\n\nSome patients with more extended dosing intervals (greater than once weekly) of epoetin zeta may not \nmaintain adequate haemoglobin levels (see section 5.1) and may require an increase in epoetin zeta\ndose. Haemoglobin levels should be monitored regularly.\n\nShunt thrombosis have occurred in haemodialysis patients, especially in those who have a tendency to \nhypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e.g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.). \nEarly shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, \nis recommended in these patients.\n\nHyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases though causality has not been established. Serum \nelectrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients. If an elevated or rising serum \npotassium level is detected, then in addition to appropriate treatment of the hyperkalaemia, \nconsideration should be given to ceasing epoetin zeta administration until the serum potassium level \nhas been corrected.\n\nAn increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy \nwith epoetin zeta as a result of the increased packed cell volume. Occlusion of the dialysis system is \npossible if heparinisation is not optimum.\n\n\n\n15\n\nBased on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin zeta in adult patients with \nrenal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal \ninsufficiency.\n\nTreatment of patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia\n\nCancer patients being treated with epoetin zeta should have haemoglobin levels measured on a regular \nbasis until a stable level is achieved, and periodically thereafter.\n\nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell (RBC) production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors,\nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours. \n\nThe role of ESAs on tumour progression or reduced progression-free survival cannot be excluded. In \ncontrolled clinical studies, use of epoetin zeta and other ESAs have been associated with decreased \nlocoregional tumour control or decreased overall survival:\n\n\uf0b7 decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \nradiation therapy when administered to achieve a haemoglobin concentration level of greater than 14 \ng/dL (8.7 mmol/L),\n\n\uf0b7 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to achieve a \nhaemoglobin concentration range of 12 to 14 g/dL (7.5 to 8.7 mmol/L),\n\n\uf0b7 increased risk of death when administered to achieve a haemoglobin concentration level of 12 \ng/dL (7.5 mmol/L) in patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor \nradiation therapy. ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population,\n\n\uf0b7 an observed 9% increase in risk for PD or death in the epoetin zeta plus SOC group from a \nprimary analysis and a 15% increased risk that cannot be statistically ruled out in patients with\nmetastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to achieve a haemoglobin \nconcentration range of 10 to 12 g/dL (6.2 to 7.5 mmol/L).\n\nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer. The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietin treatment should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the \nindividual patient, which should take into account the specific clinical context. Factors that should be \nconsidered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; \nlife-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nIn cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 to 3 week delay between ESA administration and the \nappearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin \nzeta therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).\n\nSurgery patients in autologous predonation programmes\n\nAll special warnings and special precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, \nespecially routine volume replacement, should be respected.\n\nPatients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery\n\nGood blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting.\n\nPatients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic \nprophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with \n\n\n\n16\n\nunderlying cardiovascular disease. In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with \npredisposition for development of DVTs. Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of \n>13 g/dL (>8.1 mmol/L), the possibility that epoetin zeta treatment may be associated with an \nincreased risk of postoperative thrombotic/vascular events cannot be excluded. Therefore, epoetin zeta\nshould not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin >13 g/dL (>8.1 mmol/L). \n\nThis medicinal product contains phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with \nphenylketonuria.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin zeta alters the metabolism of other \nmedicinal products. \n\nMedicinal products that decrease erythropoiesis may decrease the response to epoetin zeta.\n\nSince cyclosporin is bound by RBCs there is potential for a drug interaction. If epoetin zeta is given\nconcomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of \ncyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises. \n\nNo evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin zeta and G-CSF or GM-CSF with \nregard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.\n\nIn female adult patients with metastatic breast cancer, subcutaneous co-administration of \n40 000 IU/mL epoetin alfa with trastuzumab 6 mg/kg had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \ntrastuzumab.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of epoetin zeta in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Consequently, epoetin zeta should be used \nin pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. The use of epoetin \nzeta is not recommended in pregnant surgical patients participating in an autologous blood \npredonation. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether exogenous epoetin zeta is excreted in human milk. Epoetin zeta should be used \nwith caution in nursing women. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from Retacrit therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \nand the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nThe use of epoetin zeta is not recommended in lactating surgical patients participating in an \nautologous blood predonation programme.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no studies assessing the potential effect of epoetin zeta on male or female fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\nRetacrit has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n\n\n17\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequent adverse drug reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent \nincrease in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension. Monitoring of the blood pressure \nshould be performed, particularly at the start of therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nThe most frequently occurring adverse drug reactions observed in clinical trials of epoetin alfa are \ndiarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia and headache. Influenza-like illness may occur especially at the \nstart of treatment.\n\nRespiratory tract congestion, which includes events of upper respiratory tract congestion, nasal \ncongestion and nasopharyngitis, have been reported in studies with extended interval dosing in adult\npatients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis.\n\nAn increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in patients receiving \nESAs (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nOf a total 3 417 subjects in 25 randomised, double-blinded, placebo or standard of care controlled \nstudies, the overall safety profile of epoetin alfa was evaluated in 2 094 anaemic subjects. Included \nwere 228 epoetin alfa-treated CRF subjects in 4 chronic renal failure studies (2 studies in predialysis \n[N = 131 exposed CRF subjects] and 2 in dialysis [N = 97 exposed CRF subjects]); 1,404 exposed \ncancer subjects in 16 studies of anaemia due to chemotherapy; 147 exposed subjects in 2 studies for \nautologous blood donation; 213 exposed subjects in 1 study in the perisurgical period, and \n102 exposed subjects in 2 MDS studies. Adverse drug reactions reported by \u22651% of subjects treated \nwith epoetin alfa in these trials are shown in the table below.\n\nFrequency estimate: Very common (>1/10); common (>1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (>1/1 000 to \n<1/100); rare (>1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).\n\nMedDRA System Organ \nClassification (SOC)\n\nAdverse Reaction (Preferred \nTerm Level)\n\nFrequency\n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nPure red cell aplasia3,\nThrombocythemia\n\nRare\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nHyperkalaemia1 Uncommon\n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity3 Uncommon \nAnaphylactic reaction3 Rare \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \nConvulsion Uncommon \n\nVascular disorders Hypertension, Venous and \narterial thrombosis2\n\nCommon\n\nHypertensive crisis3 Not known\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nCough Common \nRespiratory tract congestion Uncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting Very common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nRash Common \nUrticaria3 Uncommon \nAngioneurotic oedema3 Not known \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nArthralgia, Bone pain, Myalgia,\nPain in extremity\n\nCommon \n\n\n\n18\n\nMedDRA System Organ \nClassification (SOC)\n\nAdverse Reaction (Preferred \nTerm Level)\n\nFrequency\n\nCongenital, familial and genetic \ndisorders \n\nPorphyria acute3 Rare\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nPyrexia Very common\nChills, Influenza like illness, \nInjection site reaction, Oedema \nperipheral\n\nCommon \n\nDrug ineffective3 Not known\nInvestigations Anti-erythropoietin antibody\n\npositive\nRare\n\n1 Common in dialysis\n2 Includes arterial and venous, fatal and non fatal events, such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, \nretinal thrombosis, arterial thrombosis (including myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular accidents (including \ncerebral infarction and cerebral haemorrhage) transient ischaemic attacks, and shunt thrombosis (including \ndialysis equipment) and thrombosis within arteriovenous shunt aneurisms\n3 Addressed in the subsection below and/or in section 4.4\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nHypersensitivity reactions, including cases of rash (including urticaria), anaphylactic reactions, and \nangioneurotic oedema have been reported (see section 4.4).\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in association \nwith epoetin treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nHypertensive crisis with encephalopathy and seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician \nand intensive medical care, have occurred also during epoetin zeta treatment in patients with \npreviously normal or low blood pressure. Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing \nmigraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal (see section 4.4). \n\nAntibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia has been very rarely reported in <1/10 000 cases per patient \nyear after months to years of treatment with epoetins (see section 4.4). More cases have been reported \nwith subcutaneous (SC) route of administration, compared with the IV route.\n\nAdult patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS\n\nIn the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study 4 (4.7%) subjects experienced \nTVEs (sudden death, ischaemic stroke, embolism, and phlebitis). All TVEs occurred in the epoetin \nalfa group and in the first 24 weeks of the study. Three were confirmed TVE and in the remaining case \n(sudden death), the thromboembolic event was not confirmed. Two subjects had significant risk \nfactors (atrial fibrillation, heart failure and thrombophlebitis).\n\nPaediatric population with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis\n\nThe exposure of paediatric patients with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis in clinical trials and \npost-marketing experience is limited. No paediatric-specific adverse reactions not mentioned \npreviously in the table above, or any that were not consistent with the underlying disease were \nreported in this population.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n\n\n19\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe therapeutic margin of erythropoietin is very wide. Overdosage of erythropoietin may produce \neffects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone. Phlebotomy may be \nperformed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur. Additional supportive care should be\nprovided as necessary.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antianaemic preparations, erythropoietin ATC code: B03XA01\n\nRetacrit is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nErythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone produced primarily by the kidney in response to \nhypoxia and is the key regulator of red blood cell (RBC) production. EPO is involved in all phases of \nerythroid development, and has its principal effect at the level of erythroid precursors. After EPO \nbinds to its cell surface receptor, it activates signal transduction pathways that interfere with apoptosis \nand stimulates erythroid cell proliferation. Recombinant human EPO (epoetin zeta), expressed in \nChinese hamster ovary cells, has a 165 amino acid sequence identical to that of human urinary EPO; \nthe 2 are indistinguishable on the basis of functional assays. The apparent molecular weight of \nerythropoietin is 32 000 to 40 000 dalton.\n\nErythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production. Erythropoietin receptors \nmay be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nHealthy volunteers \n\nAfter single doses (20 000 to 160 000 IU subcutaneously) of epoetin alfa, a dose-dependent response \nwas observed for the pharmacodynamic markers investigated including: reticulocytes, RBCs, and \nhaemoglobin. A defined concentration-time profile with peak and return to baseline was observed for \nchanges in percent reticulocytes. A less defined profile was observed for RBCs and haemoglobin. In \ngeneral, all pharmacodynamic markers increased in a linear manner with dose reaching a maximum \nresponse at the highest dose levels.\n\nFurther pharmacodynamic studies explored 40 000 IU once weekly versus 150 IU/kg 3 times per \nweek. Despite differences in concentration-time profiles the pharmacodynamic response (as measured \nby changes in percent reticulocytes, haemoglobin, and total RBCs) was similar between these \nregimens. Additional studies compared the 40 000 IU once-weekly regimen of epoetin alfa with \nbiweekly doses ranging from 80 000 to 120 000 IU subcutaneously. Overall, based on the results of \nthese pharmacodynamic studies in healthy subjects, the 40 000 IU once-weekly dosing regimen seems \nto be more efficient in producing RBCs than the biweekly regimens despite an observed similarity in \nreticulocyte production in the once-weekly and biweekly regimens.\n\nChronic renal failure \n\nEpoetin alfa has been shown to stimulate erythropoiesis in anaemic patients with CRF, including \ndialysis and pre-dialysis patients. The first evidence of a response to epoetin alfa is an increase in the \nreticulocyte count within 10 days, followed by increases in the red cell count, haemoglobin and \n\n\n\n20\n\nhaematocrit, usually within 2 to 6 weeks. The haemoglobin response varies between patients and may \nbe impacted by iron stores and the presence of concurrent medical problems.\n\nChemotherapy-induced anaemia \n\nEpoetin alfa administered 3 times per week or once weekly has been shown to increase haemoglobin \nand decrease transfusion requirements after the first month of therapy in anaemic cancer patients \nreceiving chemotherapy.\n\nIn a study comparing the 150 IU/kg, 3 times-per-week and 40 000 IU, once-weekly dosing regimens in \nhealthy subjects and in anaemic cancer subjects the time profiles of changes in percent reticulocytes, \nhaemoglobin, and total red blood cells were similar between the two dosing regimens in both healthy \nand anaemic cancer subjects. The AUCs of the respective pharmacodynamic parameters were similar \nbetween the 150 IU/kg, 3 times-per-week and 40 000 IU, once-weekly dosing regimens in healthy \nsubjects and also in anaemic cancer subjects.\n\nAdult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme \n\nEpoetin alfa has been shown to stimulate red blood cell production in order to augment autologous \nblood collection, and to limit the decline in haemoglobin in adult patients scheduled for major elective \nsurgery who are not expected to predeposit their complete perioperative blood needs. The greatest \neffects are observed in patients with low haemoglobin (\u2264 13 g/dL; 8.1 mmol/L).\n\nTreatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery \n\nIn patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery with a pretreatment haemoglobin of \n>10 to \u2264 13 g/dL, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease the risk of receiving allogeneic transfusions \nand hasten erythroid recovery (increased haemoglobin levels, haematocrit levels, and reticulocyte \ncounts).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nChronic renal failure \n\nEpoetin alfa has been studied in clinical trials in adult anaemic CRF patients, including haemodialysis \nand pre-dialysis patients, to treat anaemia and maintain haematocrit within a target concentration range \nof 30 to 36%.\n\nIn clinical trials at starting doses of 50 to 150 IU/kg, three times per week, approximately 95% of all\npatients responded with a clinically significant increase in haematocrit. After approximately two \nmonths of therapy, virtually all patients were transfusion-independent. Once the target haematocrit \nwas achieved, the maintenance dose was individualised for each patient.\n\nIn the three largest clinical trials conducted in adult patients on dialysis, the median maintenance dose \nnecessary to maintain the haematocrit between 30 to 36% was approximately 75 IU/kg given 3 times \nper week.\n\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, quality of life study in CRF patients on \nhaemodialysis, clinically and statistically significant improvement was shown in the patients treated \nwith epoetin alfa compared to the placebo group when measuring fatigue, physical symptoms, \nrelationships and depression (Kidney Disease Questionnaire) after six months of therapy. Patients \nfrom the group treated with epoetin alfa were also enrolled in an open-label extension study which \ndemonstrated improvements in their quality of life that were maintained for an additional 12 months.\n\n\n\n21\n\nAdult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis\n\nIn clinical trials conducted in patients with CRF not on dialysis treated with epoetin alfa, the average \nduration of therapy was nearly five months. These patients responded to epoetin alfa therapy in a \nmanner similar to that observed in patients on dialysis. Patients with CRF not on dialysis demonstrated \na dose-dependent and sustained increase in haematocrit when epoetin alfa was administered by either \nan intravenous or subcutaneous route. Similar rates of rise of haematocrit were noted when epoetin \nalfa was administered by either route. Moreover, epoetin alfa doses of 75 to 150 IU/kg per week have \nbeen shown to maintain haematocrits of 36 to 38% for up to six months.\n\nIn 2 studies with extended interval dosing of epoetin alfa (3 times per week, once weekly, once every \n2 weeks, and once every 4 weeks) some patients with longer dosing intervals did not maintain \nadequate haemoglobin levels and reached protocol-defined haemoglobin withdrawal criteria (0% in \nonce weekly, 3.7% in once-every-2-weeks, and 3.3% in the once-every-4-weeks groups).\n\nA randomized prospective trial (CHOIR) evaluated 1,432 anaemic chronic renal failure patients who \nwere not undergoing dialysis. Patients were assigned to epoetin alfa treatment targeting a maintenance \nhaemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL (higher than the recommended haemoglobin concentration level) or \n11.3 g/dL. A major cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalization for \ncongestive heart failure) occurred among 125 (18%) of the 715 patients in the higher haemoglobin \ngroup compared to 97 (14%) among the 717 patients in the lower haemoglobin group (hazard ratio \n[HR] 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.7, p = 0.03).\n\nPooled post-hoc analyses of clinical studies of ESAs have been performed in chronic renal failure \npatients (on dialysis, not on dialysis, in diabetic and non-diabetic patients). A tendency towards \nincreased risk estimates for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events associated \nwith higher cumulative ESA doses independent of the diabetes or dialysis status was observed (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nTreatment of patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia \n\nEpoetin alfa has been studied in clinical trials in adult anaemic cancer patients with lymphoid and \nsolid tumours, and patients on various chemotherapy regimens, including platinum and \nnon-platinum-containing regimens. In these trials, epoetin alfa administered 3 times per week and \nonce weekly has been shown to increase haemoglobin and decrease transfusion requirements after the \nfirst month of therapy in anaemic cancer patients. In some studies, the double-blind phase was \nfollowed by an open-label phase during which all patients received epoetin alfa and a maintenance of \neffect was observed.\n\nAvailable evidence suggests patients with haematological malignancies and solid tumours respond \nequivalently to epoetin alfa therapy, and that patients with or without tumour infiltration of the bone \nmarrow respond equivalently to epoetin alfa therapy. Comparable intensity of chemotherapy in the \nepoetin alfa and placebo groups in the chemotherapy trials was demonstrated by a similar area under \nthe neutrophil time curve in patients treated with epoetin alfa and placebo-treated patients, as well as \nby a similar proportion of patients in groups treated with epoetin alfa and placebo-treated groups \nwhose absolute neutrophil counts fell below 1 000 and 500 cells/\u03bcL.\n\nIn a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients \nwith various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant \nreduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e.g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as \nmeasured by the following instruments and scales: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-\nAnaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale \n(CLAS). Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant \nimprovement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.\n\nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2 833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an \n\n\n\n22\n\nopen-label study. The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two \nstudies) or used patient populations in which ESAs are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer \nnot receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. The desired \nhaemoglobin concentration level in two studies was >13 g/dL (8.1 mmol/L); in the remaining three \nstudies it was 12 to 14 g/dL (7.5 to 8.7 mmol/L). In the open-label study there was no difference in \noverall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls. In the \nfour placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in \nfavour of controls. These studies have shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess \nmortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received \nrecombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls. Overall survival outcome in the trials could \nnot be satisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications \nbetween those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.\n\nA patient-level data analysis has also been performed on more than 13 900 cancer patients (chemo-, \nradio-, chemoradio-, or no therapy) participating in 53 controlled clinical trials involving several \nepoetins. Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.06 in \nfavour of controls (95% CI: 1.00, 1.12; 53 trials and 13 933 patients) and for the cancer patients \nreceiving chemotherapy, the overall survival hazard ratio was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.11; 38 trials and \n10 441 patients). Meta-analyses also indicate consistently a significantly increased relative risk of \nthromboembolic events in cancer patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (see section \n4.4).\n\nA randomised, open-label, multicentre study was conducted in 2 098 anaemic women with metastatic \nbreast cancer, who received first line or second line chemotherapy. This was a non inferiority study \ndesigned to rule out a 15% risk increase in tumour progression or death of epoetin alfa plus standard of \ncare (SOC) as compared with SOC alone. At the time of clinical data cutoff, the median progression \nfree survival (PFS) per investigator assessment of disease progression was 7.4 months in each arm \n(HR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20), indicating the study objective was not met. Significantly fewer patients \nreceived RBC transfusions in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (5.8% versus 11.4%); however, \nsignificantly more patients had thrombotic vascular events in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (2.8% \nversus 1.4%). At the final analysis, 1 653 deaths were reported. Median overall survival in the epoetin \nalfa plus SOC group was 17.8 months compared with 18.0 months in the SOC alone group (HR 1.07, \n95% CI: 0.97, 1.18). The median time to progression (TTP) based on investigator-determined \nprogressive disease (PD) was 7.5 months in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 7.5 months in the \nSOC group (HR 1.099, 95% CI: 0.998, 1.210). The median TTP based on IRC-determined PD was \n8.0 months in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 8.3 months in the SOC group (HR 1.033, 95% CI: \n0.924, 1.156).\n\nAutologous predonation programme\n\nThe effect of epoetin alfa in facilitating autologous blood donation in patients with low haematocrits \n(\u2264 39% and no underlying anaemia due to iron deficiency) scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery \nwas evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 204 patients, and a \nsingle-blind placebo controlled study in 55 patients.\n\nIn the double-blind study, patients were treated with epoetin alfa 600 IU/kg or placebo intravenously \nonce daily every 3 to 4 days over 3 weeks (total 6 doses). On average, patients treated with epoetin \nalfa were able to predeposit significantly more units of blood (4.5 units) than placebo-treated patients \n(3.0 units).\n\nIn the single-blind study, patients were treated with epoetin alfa 300 IU/kg or 600 IU/kg or placebo \nintravenously once daily every 3 to 4 days over 3 weeks (total 6 doses). Patients treated with epoetin \nalfa were also able to predeposit significantly more units of blood (epoetin alfa 300 IU/kg = 4.4 units; \nepoetin alfa 600 IU/kg = 4.7 units) than placebo-treated patients (2.9 units).\n\nEpoetin alfa therapy reduced the risk of exposure to allogeneic blood by 50% compared to patients not \nreceiving epoetin alfa.\n\n\n\n23\n\nMajor elective orthopaedic surgery \n\nThe effect of epoetin alfa (300 IU/kg or 100 IU/kg) on the exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion \nhas been evaluated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in non-iron deficient adult \npatients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic hip or knee surgery. Epoetin alfa was administered \nsubcutaneously for 10 days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery, and for four days after surgery. \nPatients were stratified according to their baseline haemoglobin (\u2264 10 g/dL, >10 to \u2264 13 g/dL and \n>13 g/dL).\n\nEpoetin alfa 300 IU/kg significantly reduced the risk of allogeneic transfusion in patients with a \npretreatment haemoglobin of >10 to \u226413 g/dL. Sixteen percent of epoetin alfa 300 IU/kg, 23% of \nepoetin alfa 100 IU/kg and 45% of placebo-treated patients required transfusion.\n\nAn open-label, parallel-group trial in non-iron deficient adult subjects with a pretreatment \nhaemoglobin of \u2265 10 to \u2264 13 g/dL who were scheduled for major orthopaedic hip or knee surgery \ncompared epoetin alfa 300 IU/kg subcutaneously daily for 10 days prior to surgery, on the day of \nsurgery and for four days after surgery to epoetin alfa 600 IU/kg subcutaneously once weekly for \n3 weeks prior to surgery and on the day of surgery.\n\nFrom pretreatment to presurgery, the mean increase in haemoglobin in the 600 IU/kg weekly group \n(1.44 g/dL) was twice than that observed in the 300 IU/kg daily group (0.73 g/dL). Mean haemoglobin \nlevels were similar for the two treatment groups throughout the postsurgical period.\n\nThe erythropoietic response observed in both treatment groups resulted in similar transfusion rates \n(16% in the 600 IU/kg weekly group and 20% in the 300 IU/kg daily group).\n\nTreatment of adult patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS\n\nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nepoetin alfa in adult anaemic subjects with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS.\n\nSubjects were stratified by serum erythropoietin (sEPO) level and prior transfusion status at screening. \nKey baseline characteristics for the <200 mU/ml stratum are shown in the table below.\n\nBaseline Characteristics for Subjects with sEPO <200mU/ml at Screening\nRandomised\n\nEpoetin alfa Placebo\nTotal (N)b 85a 45\nScreening sEPO <200 mU/ml\n(N)\n\n71 39\n\nHaemoglobin (g/L)\nN 71 39\nMean 92.1 (8.57) 92.1 (8.51)\nMedian 94.0 96.0\nRange (71, 109) (69, 105)\n95% CI for Mean (90.1, 94.1) (89.3, 94.9)\nPrior Transfusions\nN 71 39\nYes 31 (43.7%) 17 (43.6%)\n\u22642 RBC Units 16 (51.6%) 9 (52.9%)\n\u02c32 and \u22644 RBC Units 14 (45.2%) 8 (47.1%)\n\u02c34 RBC Units 1 (3.2%) 0\nNo 40 (56.3%) 22 (56.4%)\na one subject did not have sEPO data\nb in the \u2265200 mU/ml stratum there were 13 subjects in the epoetin alfa group and 6 subjects in the placebo group\n\n\n\n24\n\nErythroid response was defined according to International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria as a \nhaemoglobin increase \u22651.5 g/dl from baseline or a reduction of RBC units transfused by an absolute \nnumber of at least 4 units every 8 weeks compared to the 8 weeks prior to baseline, and a response \nduration of at least 8 weeks.\n\nErythroid response during the first 24 weeks of the study was demonstrated by 27/85 (31.8%) of the \nsubjects in the epoetin alfa group compared to 2/45 (4.4%) of the subjects in the placebo group \n(p<0.001). All of the responding subjects were in the stratum with sEPO <200 mU/ml during \nscreening. In that stratum, 20/40 (50%) subjects without prior transfusions demonstrated erythroid \nresponse during the first 24 weeks, compared with 7/31 (22.6%) subjects with prior transfusions (two \nsubjects with prior transfusion reached primary endpoint based on reduction of RBC units transfused \nby an absolute number of at least 4 units every 8 weeks compared to the 8 weeks prior to baseline).\n\nMedian time from baseline to first transfusion was statistically significantly longer in the epoetin alfa \ngroup compared to placebo (49 vs. 37 days; p=0.046). After 4 weeks of treatment the time to first \ntransfusion was further increased in the epoetin alfa group (142 vs. 50 days, p=0.007). The percentage \nof subjects who were transfused in the epoetin alfa group decreased from 51.8% in the 8 weeks prior \nto baseline to 24.7% between weeks 16 and 24, compared to the placebo group which had an increase \nin transfusion rate from 48.9% to 54.1% over the same time periods.\n\nPaediatric population \n\nChronic renal failure \n\nEpoetin alfa was evaluated in an open-label, non-randomised, open dose-range, 52-week clinical study \nin paediatric CRF patients undergoing haemodialysis. The median age of patients enrolled in the study \nwas 11.6 years (range 0.5 to 20.1 years).\n\nEpoetin alfa was administered at 75 IU/kg/week intravenously in 2 or 3 divided doses post-dialysis, \ntitrated by 75 IU/kg/week at intervals of 4 weeks (up to a maximum of 300 IU/kg/week), to achieve a \n1 g/dL/month increase in haemoglobin. The desired haemoglobin concentration range was 9.6 to \n11.2 g/dL. Eighty-one percent of patients achieved the haemoglobin concentration level. The median \ntime to target was 11 weeks and the median dose at target was 150 IU/kg/week. Of the patients who \nachieved the target, 90% did so on a 3 times-per-week dosing regimen.\n\nAfter 52 weeks, 57% of patients remained in the study, receiving a median dose of 200 IU/kg/week.\n\nClinical data with subcutaneous administration in children are limited. In 5 small, open label, \nuncontrolled studies (number of patients ranged from 9-22, total N=72), Epoetin alfa has been \nadministered subcutaneously in children at starting doses of 100 IU/kg/week to 150 IU/kg/week with \nthe possibility to increase up to 300 IU/kg/week. In these studies, most were predialysis patients \n(N=44), 27 patients were on peritoneal dialysis and 2 were on haemodialysis with age ranging from \n4 months to 17 years. Overall, these studies have methodological limitations but treatment was \nassociated with positive trends towards higher haemoglobin levels. No unexpected adverse events \nwere reported (see section 4.2).\n\nChemotherapy-induced anaemia \n\nEpoetin alfa 600 IU/kg (administered intravenously or subcutaneously once weekly) has been \nevaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week study and in a randomised, \ncontrolled, open-label, 20-week study in anaemic paediatric patients receiving myelosuppressive \nchemotherapy for the treatment of various childhood non-myeloid malignancies.\n\nIn the 16-week study (n=222), in the epoetin alfa-treated patients there was no statistically significant \neffect on patient-reported or parent-reported Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory or Cancer Module \nscores compared with placebo (primary efficacy endpoint). In addition, there was no statistical \n\n\n\n25\n\ndifference between the proportion of patients requiring pRBC transfusions between the Epoetin alfa \ngroup and placebo.\n\nIn the 20-week study (n=225), no significant difference was observed in the primary efficacy endpoint, \ni.e. the proportion of patients who required a RBC transfusion after Day 28 (62% of epoetin alfa \npatients versus 69% of standard therapy patients).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing subcutaneous injection, serum levels of erythropoietin reach a peak between 12 and \n18 hours post-dose. There was no accumulation after multiple dose administration of 600 IU/kg \nadministered subcutaneously weekly.\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable erythropoietin is approximately 20% in healthy \nsubjects.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe mean volume of distribution was 49.3 mL/kg after intravenous doses of 50 and 100 IU/kg in \nhealthy subjects. Following intravenous administration of erythropoietin in subjects with chronic renal \nfailure, the volume of distribution ranged from 57-107 mL/kg after single dosing (12 IU/kg) to \n42-64 mL/kg after multiple dosing (48-192 IU/kg), respectively. Thus, the volume of distribution is \nslightly greater than the plasma space.\n\nElimination\n\nThe half-life of erythropoietin following multiple dose intravenous administration is approximately \n4 hours in healthy subjects. The half-life for the subcutaneous route is estimated to be approximately \n24 hours in healthy subjects.\n\nThe mean CL/F for the 150 IU/kg 3 times-per-week and 40 000 IU once-weekly regimens in healthy \nsubjects were 31.2 and 12.6 mL/h/kg, respectively. The mean CL/F for the 150 IU/kg, \n3-times-per-week and 40 000 IU, once-weekly regimens in the anaemic cancer subjects were 45.8 and \n11.3 mL/h/kg, respectively. In most anaemic subjects with cancer receiving cyclic chemotherapy CL/F \nwas lower after subcutaneous doses of 40 000 IU once weekly and 150 IU/kg, 3 times per week \ncompared with the values for healthy subjects.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nIn healthy subjects, a dose-proportional increase in serum erythropoietin concentrations was observed \nafter intravenous administration of 150 and 300 IU/kg, 3 times per week. Administration of single \ndoses of 300 to 2 400 IU/kg subcutaneous erythropoietin resulted in a linear relationship between \nmean Cmax and dose and between mean AUC and dose. An inverse relationship between apparent \nclearance and dose was noted in healthy subjects.\n\nIn studies to explore extending the dosing interval (40 000 IU once weekly and 80 000, 100 000, and \n120 000 IU biweekly), a linear but non-dose-proportional relationship was observed between mean \nCmax and dose, and between mean AUC and dose at steady state.\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\n\nErythropoietins exhibit a dose-related effect on haematological parameters which is independent of\nroute of administration.\n\n\n\n26\n\nPaediatric population \n\nA half-life of approximately 6.2 to 8.7 hours has been reported in paediatric subjects with chronic \nrenal failure following multiple dose intravenous administration of erythropoietin. The \npharmacokinetic profile of erythropoietins in children and adolescents appears to be similar to that of \nadults.\n\nPharmacokinetic data in neonates is limited.\n\nA study of 7 preterm very low birth weight neonates and 10 healthy adults given i.v. erythropoietin \nsuggested that distribution volume was approximately 1.5 to 2 times higher in the preterm neonates \nthan in the healthy adults, and clearance was approximately 3 times higher in the preterm neonates \nthan in healthy adults.\n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn chronic renal failure patients, the half-life of intravenously administered erythropoietin is slightly \nprolonged, approximately 5 hours, compared to healthy subjects.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn repeated dose toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was \nassociated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis. Bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of \nchronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown \nfactors. The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients \nwho were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis \npatients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa. \n\nEpoetin alfa does not induce bacterial gene mutation (Ames Test), chromosomal aberrations in \nmammalian cells, micronuclei in mice, or gene mutation at the HGPRT locus.\n\nLong-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out. Conflicting reports in the literature, \nbased on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, suggest erythropoietins may play a role as \ntumour proliferators. This is of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.\n\nIn cell cultures of human bone marrow cells, epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and \ndoes not affect leucopoiesis. Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be \ndetected.\n\nIn animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and \nincrease foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended \nhuman weekly dose. These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body \nweight gain, and the significance to humans is unknown given therapeutic dose levels. \n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n\uf02d If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\uf02d This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n\uf02d If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Retacrit is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Retacrit\n3. How to use Retacrit\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Retacrit\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Retacrit is and what it is used for\n\nRetacrit contains the active substance epoetin zeta \u2013 a protein that stimulates the bone marrow to \nproduce more red blood cells which carry haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen). Epoetin \nzeta is a copy of the human protein erythropoietin (ee-rith-roe-po-eh-tin) and acts in the same way.\n\n\uf0b7 Retacrit is used to treat symptomatic anaemia caused by kidney disease\n\n\uf0b7 in children on haemodialysis. \n\uf0b7 in adults on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\n\uf0b7 in severely anaemic adults not yet undergoing dialysis. \n\nIf you have kidney disease, you may be short of red blood cells if your kidney does not produce\nenough erythropoietin (necessary for red cell production). Retacrit is prescribed to stimulate\nyour bone marrow to produce more red blood cells.\n\n\uf0b7 Retacrit is used to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, \nmalignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) who may have a need for a \nblood transfusion. Retacrit can reduce the need for a blood transfusion in these patients.\n\n\n\n95\n\n\uf0b7 Retacrit is used in moderately anaemic adults who donate some of their blood before\nsurgery, so that it can be given back to them during or after the operation. Because Retacrit \nstimulates the production of red blood cells, doctors can take more blood from these people.\n\n\uf0b7 Retacrit is used in moderately anaemic adults about to have major orthopaedic surgery\n(for example hip or knee replacement operations), to reduce the potential need for blood \ntransfusions.\n\n\uf0b7 Retacrit is used to treat anaemia in adults with a bone marrow disorder that causes a\nsevere disruption in the creation of blood cells (myelodysplastic syndromes). Retacrit can\nreduce the need for a blood transfusion.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Retacrit\n\nDo not use Retacrit\n\n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to epoetin zeta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).\n\n\uf0b7 If you have been diagnosed with Pure Red Cell Aplasia (the bone marrow cannot produce\nenough red blood cells) after previous treatment with any product that stimulates red blood cell\nproduction (including Retacrit). See section 4.\n\n\uf0b7 If you have high blood pressure not properly controlled with medicines.\n\n\uf0b7 To stimulate the production of your red blood cells (so that doctors can take more blood from\nyou) if you cannot have transfusions with your own blood during or after surgery.\n\n\uf0b7 If you are due to have major elective orthopaedic surgery (such as hip or knee surgery), and\nyou:\n\uf0b7 have severe heart disease\n\uf0b7 have severe disorders of the veins and arteries\n\uf0b7 have recently had a heart attack or stroke\n\uf0b7 can\u2019t take medicines to thin the blood\n\nRetacrit may not be suitable for you. Please discuss with your doctor. While on Retacrit, some\npeople need medicines to reduce the risk of blood clots. If you can\u2019t take medicines that \nprevent blood clotting, you must not have Retacrit.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Retacrit.\n\nTake special care with Retacrit\n\nRetacrit and other products that stimulate red cell production may increase the risk of \ndeveloping blood clots in all patients. This risk may be higher if you have other risk factors for\ndeveloping blood clots (for example, if you have had a blood clot in the past or are overweight, have \ndiabetes, have heart disease or you are off your feet for a long time because of surgery or illness).\nPlease tell your doctor about any of these things. Your doctor will help you to decide if Retacrit is\nsuitable for you.\n\nTalk to your doctor if any of the following apply to you. You may still be able to use Retacrit, but \ndiscuss it with your doctor first: \n\n\n\n96\n\n\uf0b7 If you know you suffer, or have suffered, from:\n\uf0b7 high blood pressure;\n\uf0b7 epileptic seizures or fits\n\uf0b7 liver disease\n\uf0b7 anaemia from other causes \n\uf0b7 porphyria (a rare blood disorder)\n\n\uf0b7 If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly \nto Retacrit, your doctor will check your dose of Retacrit because repeatedly increasing your \ndose of Retacrit if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a\nproblem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke \nand death.\n\n\uf0b7 If you are a cancer patient be aware that products that stimulate red blood cell production (like \nRetacrit) may act as a growth factor and therefore in theory may affect the progression of your \ncancer. Depending on your individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. \nPlease discuss this with your doctor.\n\n\uf0b7 If you are a cancer patient, be aware that use of Retacrit may be associated with shorter\nsurvival and a higher death rate in head and neck, and metastatic breast cancer patients who are\nreceiving chemotherapy.\n\n\uf0b7 Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal\nnecrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment.\n\nSJS/TEN can appear initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central\nblisters on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen\neyes) can occur. These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. \nThe rashes may progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications.\n\nIf you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking Retacrit and\ncontact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately.\n\nTake special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production:\n\nRetacrit is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells, like the human \nprotein erythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional will always record the exact product you are\nusing.\n\nIf you are given a product in this group other than Retacrit during your treatment, speak to your doctor\nor pharmacist before using it.\n\nOther medicines and Retacrit\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIf you are taking a medicine called cyclosporin (used e.g. after kidney transplants), your doctor may \norder blood tests to check the level of cyclosporin while you are taking Retacrit.\n\nIron supplements and other blood stimulants may increase the effectiveness of Retacrit. Your \ndoctor will decide if it is right for you to take them.\n\nIf you visit a hospital, clinic or family doctor, tell them you are having Retacrit treatment. It may\naffect other treatments or test results.\n\n\n\n97\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\n\nIt is important to tell your doctor if any of the following apply to you. You may still be able to use\nRetacrit, but discuss it with your doctor first.\n\n\uf0b7 If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n\uf0b7 If you are breast-feeding.\n\nNo data on the effects of epoetin zeta on fertility are available.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nRetacrit has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nRetacrit contains phenylalanine\n\nThis medicine contains phenylalanine and may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria (genetic \nenzyme deficiency that increases excretion of a chemical (phenylketone) in urine and may cause \nnervous system disorders).\n\nRetacrit contains sodium\n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3. How to use Retacrit\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are \nnot sure.\n\nYour doctor has carried out blood tests and decided you need Retacrit.\n\nRetacrit may be given by injection:\n\uf0b7 Either into a vein or a tube that goes into a vein (intravenously)\n\uf0b7 Or under the skin (subcutaneously).\n\nYour doctor will decide how Retacrit will be injected. Usually the injections will be given to you by a\ndoctor, nurse or other health care professional. Some people, depending on why they need Retacrit \ntreatment, may later learn how to inject themselves under the skin: see Instructions on how to inject \nRetacrit yourself.\n\nRetacrit should not be used:\n\uf0b7 after the expiry date on the label and outer carton\n\uf0b7 if you know, or think that it may have been accidentally frozen, or\n\uf0b7 if there has been a refrigerator failure.\n\nThe dose of Retacrit you receive is based on your bodyweight in kilograms. The cause of your\nanaemia is also a factor in your doctor deciding the correct dose.\n\nYour doctor will monitor your blood pressure regularly while you are using Retacrit.\n\nPeople with kidney disease\n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will maintain your haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL as a high \nhaemoglobin level may increase the risk of blood clots and death. In children the haemoglobin\nlevel should be maintained between 9.5 and 11 g/dL.\n\n\n\n98\n\n\uf0b7 The usual starting dose of Retacrit for adults and children is 50 International Units (IU) per \nkilogram (/kg) of body weight given three times a week.\n\n\uf0b7 For patients on peritoneal dialysis Retacrit may be given twice a week.\n\uf0b7 For adults and children Retacrit is given as an injection either into a vein (intravenously) or a \n\ntube that goes into a vein. When this access (via a vein or tube) is not readily available, your \ndoctor may decide that Retacrit should be injected under the skin (subcutaneously). This \nincludes patients on dialysis and patients not yet on dialysis.\n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will order regular blood tests to see how your anaemia is responding and may\nadjust the dose, usually no more frequently than every four weeks. A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dL over a four week period should be avoided.\n\n\uf0b7 Once your anaemia has been corrected, your doctor will continue to check your blood regularly. \nYour Retacrit dose and frequency of administration may be further adjusted to maintain your \nresponse to treatment. Your doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of \nyour anaemia.\n\n\uf0b7 If you do not respond adequately to Retacrit, your doctor will check your dose and will inform \nyou if you need to change doses of Retacrit.\n\n\uf0b7 If you are on a more extended dosing interval (greater than once weekly) of Retacrit, you may \nnot maintain adequate haemoglobin levels and you may require an increase in Retacrit dose or \nfrequency of administration.\n\n\uf0b7 You may be given iron supplements before and during Retacrit treatment to make it more \neffective.\n\n\uf0b7 If you are having dialysis treatment when you begin treatment with Retacrit, your dialysis \nregime may need to be adjusted. Your doctor will decide this.\n\nAdults on chemotherapy\n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may initiate treatment with Retacrit if your haemoglobin is 10 g/dL or less.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will maintain your haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL as a high \n\nhaemoglobin level may increase the risk of blood clots and death.\n\uf0b7 The starting dose is either 150 IU per kilogram bodyweight three times a week or 450 IU per \n\nkilogram bodyweight once a week. \n\uf0b7 Retacrit is given by injection under the skin.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will order blood tests, and may adjust the dose, depending on how your anaemia\n\nresponds to Retacrit treatment.\n\uf0b7 You may be given iron supplements before and during Retacrit treatment to make it more\n\neffective.\n\uf0b7 You will usually continue Retacrit treatment for one month after the end of chemotherapy.\n\nAdults donating their own blood\n\n\uf0b7 The usual dose is 600 IU per kilogram bodyweight twice a week.\n\uf0b7 Retacrit is given by injection into a vein immediately after you have donated blood for 3 weeks \n\nbefore your surgery. \n\uf0b7 You may be given iron supplements before and during Retacrit treatment to make it more\n\neffective.\n\nAdults scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery\n\n\uf0b7 The recommended dose is 600 IU per kilogram bodyweight once a week.\n\uf0b7 Retacrit is given by injection under the skin each week for three weeks before surgery and on \n\nthe day of surgery. \n\uf0b7 If there is a medical need to reduce the time before your operation, you will be given a daily\n\ndose of 300 IU/kg for up to ten days before surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days \nimmediately afterwards.\n\n\uf0b7 If blood tests show your haemoglobin is too high before the operation, the treatment will be \nstopped.\n\n\n\n99\n\n\uf0b7 You may be given iron supplements before and during Retacrit treatment to make it more \neffective.\n\nAdults with myelodysplastic syndrome\n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may initiate treatment with Retacrit if your haemoglobin is 10 g/dL or less. The \naim of treatment is to maintain your haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dL as a higher \nhaemoglobin level may increase the risk of blood clots and death.\n\n\uf0b7 Retacrit is given by injection under the skin.\n\uf0b7 The starting dose is 450 IU per kilogram bodyweight once a week.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will order blood tests, and may adjust the dose, depending on how your anaemia\n\nresponds to Retacrit treatment.\n\nInstructions on how to inject Retacrit yourself\n\nWhen treatment starts, Retacrit is usually injected by medical professional or a nurse. Later, your \ndoctor may suggest that you or your caregiver learn how to inject Retacrit under the skin \n(subcutaneously) yourself.\n\n\uf0b7 Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you have been trained to do so by your doctor or\nnurse.\n\n\uf0b7 Always use Retacrit exactly as instructed by your doctor or nurse.\n\uf0b7 Only use Retacrit if it has been stored correctly \u2013 see section 5, How to Store Retacrit.\n\uf0b7 Before use, leave the Retacrit syringe to stand until it reaches room temperature. This \n\nusually takes between 15 and 30 minutes.\n\nOnly take one dose of Retacrit from each syringe.\n\nIf Retacrit is injected under the skin (subcutaneously), the amount injected is not normally more than \none millilitre (1 ml) in a single injection.\n\nRetacrit is given alone and not mixed with other liquids for injection.\n\nDo not shake Retacrit syringes. Prolonged vigorous shaking may damage the product. If the product \nhas been shaken vigorously, don\u2019t use it.\n\nHow to inject yourself using a pre-filled syringe\n\n\uf0b7 Take a syringe out of the refrigerator. The liquid needs to come to room temperature. Do not \nremove the syringe\u2019s needle cover while allowing it to reach room temperature.\n\n\uf0b7 Check the syringe, to make sure it is the right dose, has not passed its expiry date, is not\ndamaged, and the liquid is clear and not frozen.\n\n\uf0b7 Choose an injection site. Good sites are the top of the thigh and around the tummy (abdomen) \nbut away from the navel. Vary the site from day to day.\n\n\uf0b7 Wash your hands. Use an antiseptic swab on the injection site, to disinfect it.\n\uf0b7 Hold the pre-filled syringe by the body of the syringe with the covered needle pointing upward.\n\uf0b7 Do not hold by the plunger head, plunger or needle cover.\n\uf0b7 Do not pull back on the plunger at any time.\n\uf0b7 Do not remove the needle cover from the pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject your \n\nmedicine.\n\uf0b7 Take the cover off the syringe by holding the barrel and pulling the cover off carefully without \n\ntwisting it. Don\u2019t push the plunger, touch the needle or shake the syringe.\n\uf0b7 Pinch a fold of skin between your thumb and index finger. Don\u2019t squeeze it.\n\uf0b7 Push the needle in fully. Your doctor or nurse may have shown you how to do this.\n\uf0b7 Push the plunger with your thumb as far as it will go to inject the entire amount of liquid. Push \n\nit slowly and evenly, keeping the skin fold pinched. \n\n\n\n100\n\n\uf0b7 When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, take out the needle and let go of the skin.\n\uf0b7 When the needle is pulled out of your skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. \n\nThis is normal. You can press an antiseptic swab over the injection site for a few seconds after \nthe injection.\n\n\uf0b7 Dispose of your used syringe in a sharps container. Do not try to replace the needle cover.\n\uf0b7 Never put used syringes into your normal household waste bin.\n\nHow to inject yourself using a pre-filled syringe\n\nYour pre-filled syringe has a passive needle guard device attached to it in order to protect you from \nneedle stick injury. \n\n\uf0b7 Take a syringe out of the refrigerator. The liquid needs to come to room temperature. Do not \nremove the syringe\u2019s needle cover while allowing it to reach room temperature.\n\n\uf0b7 Check the syringe, to make sure it is the right dose, has not passed its expiry date, is not \ndamaged, and the liquid is clear and not frozen.\n\n\uf0b7 Choose an injection site. Good sites are the top of the thigh and around the tummy (abdomen) \nbut away from the navel. Vary the site from day to day.\n\n\uf0b7 Wash your hands. Use an antiseptic swab on the injection site, to disinfect it.\n\uf0b7 Hold the pre-filled syringe by the body of the syringe with the covered needle pointing upward.\n\uf0b7 Do not hold by the plunger head, plunger or needle cover.\n\uf0b7 Do not pull back on the plunger at any time.\n\uf0b7 Do not remove the needle cover from the pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject your \n\nmedicine.\n\uf0b7 Take the cover off the syringe by holding the barrel and pulling the cover off carefully without \n\ntwisting it. Don\u2019t push the plunger, touch the needle or shake the syringe.\n\uf0b7 Pinch a fold of skin between your thumb and index finger. Don\u2019t squeeze it.\n\uf0b7 Push the needle in fully. Your doctor or nurse may have shown you how to do this.\n\uf0b7 Depress the plunger while grasping the finger flange until the entire dose has been given. The \n\nneedle guard will NOT activate unless the ENTIRE dose has been given.\n\n\uf0b7 When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, take out the needle and let go of the skin.\n\uf0b7 Let go of the plunger and allow the syringe to move up until the entire needle is guarded and \n\nlocks into place.\n\n\uf0b7 When the needle is pulled out of your skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. \nThis is normal. You can press an antiseptic swab over the injection site for a few seconds after \nthe injection.\n\n\uf0b7 Dispose of your used syringe in a sharps container. Do not try to replace the needle cover.\n\n\n\n101\n\n\uf0b7 Never put used syringes into your normal household waste bin.\n\nHow to inject yourself using a pre-filled syringe\n\nYour syringe has a needle-trap attached to it which is designed to specifically help prevent accidental \nneedle stick injuries following the proper administration of injectable medicines. It consists of a plastic \nneedle \u201ccatcher\u201d which is firmly attached to the syringe label. Together, these two components \ncomprise the needle-trap (safety) feature. \n\nThe needle-trap requires specific actions by the user to \u201cactivate\u201d it, which will render the needle \nharmless after the injection is administered.\n\n\uf0b7 Take a syringe out of the refrigerator. The liquid needs to come to room temperature. Do not \nremove the syringe\u2019s needle cover while allowing it to reach room temperature.\n\n\uf0b7 Check the syringe, to make sure it is the right dose, has not passed its expiry date, is not \ndamaged, and the liquid is clear and not frozen.\n\n\uf0b7 Choose an injection site. Good sites are the top of the thigh and around the tummy (abdomen) \nbut away from the navel. Vary the site from day to day.\n\n\uf0b7 Wash your hands. Use an antiseptic swab on the injection site, to disinfect it.\n\uf0b7 Hold the pre-filled syringe by the body of the syringe with the covered needle pointing upward.\n\uf0b7 Do not hold by the plunger head, plunger or needle cover.\n\uf0b7 Do not pull back on the plunger at any time.\n\uf0b7 Grasp the tip of the plastic needle catcher and bend it away from needle cover.\n\n\uf0b7 Do not remove the needle cover from the pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject your \nmedicine.\n\n\uf0b7 Take the cover off the syringe by holding the barrel and pulling the cover off carefully without \ntwisting it. Don\u2019t push the plunger, touch the needle or shake the syringe.\n\n\uf0b7 Pinch a fold of skin between your thumb and index finger. Don\u2019t squeeze it.\n\uf0b7 Push the needle in fully. Your doctor or nurse may have shown you how to do this.\n\uf0b7 Push the plunger with your thumb as far as it will go to inject the entire amount of liquid. Push \n\nit slowly and evenly, keeping the skin fold pinched. \n\uf0b7 When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, take out the needle and let go of the skin.\n\uf0b7 Place the plastic catcher of the needle-trap against a hard, stable surface and with one hand pivot \n\nthe syringe barrel upward against the needle forcing the needle into the catcher where it locks in \nplace (an audible 'click\u201d is heard when the needle is locked in the catcher). Continue bending \nthe needle until the syringe exceeds a 45 degree angle with the flat surface to render it \npermanently unusable.\n\n\n\n102\n\n\uf0b7 When the needle is pulled out of your skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. \nThis is normal. You can press an antiseptic swab over the injection site for a few seconds after \nthe injection.\n\n\uf0b7 Dispose of your used syringe in a sharps container. Do not try to replace the needle cover.\n\uf0b7 Never put used syringes into your normal household waste bin.\n\nIf you use more Retacrit than you should\n\nTell the doctor or nurse immediately if you think too much Retacrit has been injected. Side effects\nfrom an overdose of Retacrit are unlikely.\n\nIf you forget to use Retacrit\n\nMake the next injection as soon as you remember. If you are within a day of your next injection, forget \nthe missed one and carry on with your normal schedule. Do not double up the injections to make up \nfor a forgotten dose. \n\nIf you are a patient with hepatitis C and you receive interferon and ribavirin\n\nYou should discuss this with your doctor because a combination of epoetin zeta with interferon and\nribavirin has led to a loss of effect and development of a condition called pure red cell aplasia\n(PRCA), a severe form of anaemia, in rare cases. Retacrit is not approved in the management of\nanaemia associated with hepatitis C.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you notice any of the effects in this list.\n\nSerious skin rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been\nreported in association with epoetin treatment. These can appear as reddish target-like macules or\ncircular patches often with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose,\ngenitals and eyes and can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms. Stop using Retacrit if you\ndevelop these symptoms and contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately.

Headaches, particularly sudden, stabbing migraine-like headaches, \n\nfeeling confused or having fits may be signs of a sudden increase in blood pressure. This \nrequires urgent treatment. Raised blood pressure may require treatment with medicines (or \nadjustment to any medicines you already take for high blood pressure).\n\n\uf0b7 Blood clots (including deep vein thrombosis and embolism) that may require urgent treatment.\nYou may have chest pain, breathlessness, and painful swelling and redness, usually in the \nleg as symptoms.\n\n\uf0b7 Cough\n\uf0b7 Skin rashes, which may result from an allergic reaction.\n\uf0b7 Bone or muscle pain\n\uf0b7 Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, aches and pains in the joints, feeling of weakness, chills, \n\ntiredness and dizziness. These may be more common at the start of treatment. If you have these \nsymptoms during injection into the vein, a slower delivery of the injection may help to avoid \nthem in the future.\n\n\uf0b7 Redness, burning and pain at the site of injection\n\uf0b7 Swelling of the ankles, feet or fingers\n\uf0b7 Arm or leg pain\n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people.\n\uf0b7 High levels of blood potassium which can cause abnormal heart rhythm (this is a very common \n\nside effect in patients on dialysis).\n\uf0b7 Fits\n\uf0b7 Nose or airway congestion\n\uf0b7 Allergic reaction\n\uf0b7 Hives\n\nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people.\n\uf0b7 Symptoms of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA)\n\nPRCA means the bone marrow does not make enough red blood cells. PRCA causes sudden \nand severe anaemia. The symptoms are:\no unusual tiredness,\no feeling dizzy,\no breathlessness.\n\nPRCA has been very rarely reported mostly in patients with kidney disease after months to years \nof treatment with Retacrit and other products that stimulate red blood cell production.\n\n\uf0b7 An increase in levels of small blood cells (called platelets), which are normally involved in the \nformation of a blood clot may occur, particularly when starting treatment. Your doctor will\ncheck on this.\n\n\uf0b7 Severe allergic reaction that may include: \no a swollen face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat \no difficulty swallowing or breathing\no itchy rash (hives).\n\n\uf0b7 Problem with the blood that may cause pain, dark coloured urine or increased sensitivity of the\nskin to sunlight (porphyria).\n\nIf you are receiving haemodialysis:\n\uf0b7 Blood clots (thrombosis) may form in your dialysis shunt. This is more likely if you have low\n\nblood pressure or if your fistula has complications.\n\n\n\n104\n\n\uf0b7 Blood clots may also form in your haemodialysis system. Your doctor may decide to increase\nyour heparin dose during dialysis.\n\nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you are aware of any of these effects, or if you notice any\nother effects while you are receiving treatment with Retacrit.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.

marrow to produce more red blood cells which carry haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen). epoetin zeta is a copy of the human protein erythropoietin (ee-rith-roe-po-eh-tin) and acts in the same way. retacrit is used to treat symptomatic anaemia caused by kidney disease in children on haemodialysis. in adults on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. in severely anaemic adults not yet undergoing dialysis. if you have kidney disease, you may be short of red blood cells if your kidney does not produce enough erythropoietin (necessary for red cell production). retacrit is prescribed to stimulate your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. retacrit is used to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) who may have a need for a blood transfusion. retacrit can reduce the need for a blood transfusion in these patients. retacrit is used in moderately anaemic adults who donate some of their blood before surgery, so that it can be given back to them during or after the operation. because retacrit stimulates the production of red blood cells, doctors can take more blood from these people. retacrit is used in moderately anaemic adults about to have major orthopaedic surgery (for example hip or knee replacement operations), to reduce the potential need for blood transfusions. retacrit is used to treat anaemia in adults with a bone marrow disorder that causes a severe disruption in the creation of blood cells (myelodysplastic syndromes). retacrit can reduce the need for a blood transfusion.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "retacrit", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "the active substance epoetin zeta a protein", "Type": "TREATMENT",

"Section_Content": "do not use retacrit if you are allergic to epoetin zeta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you have been diagnosed with pure red cell aplasia (the bone marrow cannot produce enough red blood cells) after previous treatment with any product that stimulates red blood cell production (including retacrit). see section 4. if you have high blood pressure not properly controlled with medicines. to stimulate the production of your red blood cells (so that doctors can take more blood from you) if you cannot have transfusions with your own blood during or after surgery. if you are due to have major elective orthopaedic surgery (such as hip or knee surgery), and you: have severe heart disease have severe disorders of the veins and arteries have recently had a heart attack or stroke can't take medicines to thin the blood retacrit may not be suitable for you. please discuss with your doctor. while on retacrit, some people need medicines to reduce the risk of blood clots. if you can't take medicines that prevent blood clotting, you must not have retacrit. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using retacrit. take special care with retacrit retacrit and other products that stimulate red cell production may increase the risk of developing blood clots in all patients. this risk may be higher if you have other risk factors for developing blood clots (for example, if you have had a blood clot in the past or are overweight, have diabetes, have heart disease or you are off your feet for a long time because of surgery or illness). please tell your doctor about any of these things. your doctor will help you to decide if retacrit is suitable for you. talk to your doctor if any of the following apply to you. you may still be able to use retacrit, but discuss it with your doctor first: 96 if you know you suffer, or have suffered, from: high blood pressure; epileptic seizures or fits liver disease anaemia from other causes porphyria (a rare blood disorder) if you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to retacrit, your doctor will check your dose of retacrit because repeatedly increasing your dose of retacrit if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. if you are a cancer patient be aware that products that stimulate red blood cell production (like retacrit) may act as a growth factor and therefore in theory may affect the progression of your cancer. depending on your individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable. please discuss this with your doctor. if you are a cancer patient, be aware that use of retacrit may be associated with shorter survival and a higher death rate in head and neck, and metastatic breast cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy. serious skin reactions including stevens-johnson syndrome (sjs) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. sjs/ten can appear initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. these serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. the rashes may progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications. if you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms, stop taking retacrit and contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: retacrit is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells, like the human protein erythropoietin does. your healthcare professional will always record the exact product you are using. if you are given a product in this group other than retacrit during your treatment, speak to your doctor or pharmacist before using it. other medicines and retacrit tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. if you are taking a medicine called cyclosporin (used e.g. after kidney transplants), your doctor may order blood tests to check the level of cyclosporin while you are taking retacrit. iron supplements and other blood stimulants may increase the effectiveness of retacrit. your doctor will decide if it is right for you to take them. if you visit a hospital, clinic or family doctor, tell them you are having retacrit treatment. it may affect other treatments or test results. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility it is important to tell your doctor if any of the following apply to you. you may still be able to use retacrit, but discuss it with your doctor first. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. if you are breast-feeding. no data on the effects of epoetin zeta on fertility are available. driving and using machines retacrit has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive and use machines. retacrit contains phenylalanine this medicine contains phenylalanine and may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria (genetic enzyme deficiency that increases excretion of a chemical (phenylketone) in urine and may cause nervous system disorders). retacrit contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "retacrit", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text":

doctor or nurse immediately if you notice any of the effects in this list. serious skin rashes including stevens-johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. these can appear as reddish target-like macules or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes and can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms. stop using retacrit if you develop these symptoms and contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. see also section 2. very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people. diarrhoea feeling sick in your stomach vomiting fever respiratory tract congestion, such as stuffy nose and sore throat, has been reported in patients with kidney disease not yet on dialysis. common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people. increased blood pressure. headaches, particularly sudden, stabbing migraine-like headaches, feeling confused or having fits may be signs of a sudden increase in blood pressure. this requires urgent treatment. raised blood pressure may require treatment with medicines (or adjustment to any medicines you already take for high blood pressure). blood clots (including deep vein thrombosis and embolism) that may require urgent treatment. you may have chest pain, breathlessness, and painful swelling and redness, usually in the leg as symptoms. cough skin rashes, which may result from an allergic reaction. bone or muscle pain flu-like symptoms, such as headache, aches and pains in the joints, feeling of weakness, chills, tiredness and dizziness. these may be more common at the start of treatment. if you have these symptoms during injection into the vein, a slower delivery of the injection may help to avoid them in the future. redness, burning and pain at the site of injection swelling of the ankles, feet or fingers arm or leg pain uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people. high levels of blood potassium which can cause abnormal heart rhythm (this is a very common side effect in patients on dialysis). fits nose or airway congestion allergic reaction hives rare: may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people. symptoms of pure red cell aplasia (prca) prca means the bone marrow does not make enough red blood cells. prca causes sudden and severe anaemia. the symptoms are: o unusual tiredness, o feeling dizzy, o breathlessness. prca has been very rarely reported mostly in patients with kidney disease after months to years of treatment with retacrit and other products that stimulate red blood cell production. an increase in levels of small blood cells (called platelets), which are normally involved in the formation of a blood clot may occur, particularly when starting treatment. your doctor will check on this. severe allergic reaction that may include: o a swollen face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat o difficulty swallowing or breathing o itchy rash (hives). problem with the blood that may cause pain, dark coloured urine or increased sensitivity of the skin to sunlight (porphyria). if you are receiving haemodialysis: blood clots (thrombosis) may form in your dialysis shunt. this is more likely if you have low blood pressure or if your fistula has complications. blood clots may also form in your haemodialysis system. your doctor may decide to increase your heparin dose during dialysis. tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you are aware of any of these effects, or if you notice any other effects while you are receiving treatment with retacrit. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in
