This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRizmoic 200 micrograms film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach tablet contains 200 micrograms naldemedine (as tosylate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\nRound, approximately 6.5 mm diameter, yellow tablet debossed with '222' and Shionogi logo on one \n\nside and '0.2' on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRizmoic is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have \n\npreviously been treated with a laxative. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of naldemedine is 200 micrograms (one tablet) daily. \n\nRizmoic may be used with or without laxative(s). It may be taken at any time of the day but it is \n\nrecommended to be taken at the same time every day. \n\nAlteration of the analgesic dosing regimen prior to initiating Rizmoic is not required. \n\nRizmoic must be discontinued if treatment with the opioid pain medicinal product is discontinued. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients older than 65 years of age (see section 5.2). \n\nDue to the limited therapeutic experience in patients 75 years old and older, naldemedine therapy \n\nshould be initiated with caution in this age group. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nDue to the limited therapeutic experience, patients with severe renal impairment should be clinically \n\nmonitored when initiating therapy with naldemedine. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. \n\nUse in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nOpioid pain medicinal products \n\nThere is limited experience in patients treated with opioid pain medicinal product(s) at daily doses of \n\nmore than the equivalent of 400 mg of morphine. There is no experience in patients treated for \n\nconstipation induced by partial opioid mu-agonists (e.g. buprenorphine). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of naldemedine in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not yet \n\nbeen established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. \n\nRizmoic should be taken once daily, with or without food (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nPatients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation or patients at increased \n\nrisk of recurrent obstruction, due to the potential for gastrointestinal perforation (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal perforation \n\nCases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in the post-marketing setting, including fatal \n\ncases, when naldemedine was used in patients who were at an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) \n\nperforation, (e.g. diverticular disease and underlying malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract or \n\nperitoneal metastases). \n\nNaldemedine must not be used in patients with known or suspected GI obstruction or in patients at \n\nincreased risk of recurrent obstruction, due to the potential for GI perforation (see section 4.3). \n\nCaution with regards to the use of naldemedine should be exercised in patients with any \n\nconditions which might result in impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g. peptic ulcer \n\ndisease, Ogilvie\u2019s syndrome, malignancy of the GI tract, Crohn\u2019s disease). The overall benefit risk for \neach patient should be taken into account. Patients should be monitored for the development of severe, \n\npersistent or worsening abdominal pain. If obstruction or perforation are suspected, naldemedine must \n\nbe discontinued (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \n\nAbdominal adverse reactions (e.g. abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea) have been reported with \n\nRizmoic. Patients should be advised to report severe, persistent or worsening symptoms to their \n\nphysician. In cases of severe diarrhoea or abdominal pain, the patient should be monitored and treated \n\nfor dehydration using rehydration and appropriate treatment as needed (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nOpioid withdrawal syndrome \n\nOpioid withdrawal syndrome is a cluster of three or more of the following signs or symptoms: \n\ndysphoric mood, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, lacrimation or rhinorrhea, pupillary dilation or \n\npiloerection or sweating, diarrhoea, yawning, fever or insomnia. Opioid withdrawal syndrome \n\ntypically develops within minutes to several days following administration of an opioid antagonist. \n\nCaution should be exercised with regards to opioid withdrawal. Patients should be advised to \n\ndiscontinue naldemedine and to contact their physician if opioid withdrawal occurs. Cases of possible \n\nopioid withdrawal syndrome have been reported in the naldemedine clinical programme (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients having disruptions to the blood-brain barrier (e.g., primary brain malignancies, central \n\nnervous system (CNS) metastases or other inflammatory conditions, active multiple sclerosis and \n\nadvanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease) may be at increased risk of opioid withdrawal or reduced analgesia. \nThe overall benefit-risk of naldemedine should be considered in these patients with close monitoring \n\nfor symptoms of opioid withdrawal. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nPatients with cardiovascular conditions \n\nNaldemedine was not studied in the clinical trial programme in patients who had a recent history of \n\nmyocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischaemic attack within 3 months of screening. These \n\npatients should be clinically monitored when taking Rizmoic. \n\nA QTc study performed with naldemedine in healthy volunteers did not indicate any prolongation of \n\nthe QT interval. Patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors were not excluded from the \n\nnaldemedine clinical trial programme, with BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2, and a medical history of hypertension \nand/or dyslipidaemia being the most commonly reported risk factors. \n\n \n\nSevere hepatic impairment \n\nNaldemedine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The use of naldemedine \n\nis not recommended in these patients (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers \n\nConcomitant use of naldemedine with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. grapefruit juice, itraconazole, \n\nketoconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and clarithromycin) leads to an increase in \n\nnaldemedine exposure and may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Concomitant use with strong \n\nCYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of naldemedine with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum \nperforatum), rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin) leads to a decrease in \n\nnaldemedine exposure and may reduce the efficacy of naldemedine. Concomitant use with strong \n\nCYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5). Concomitant use of naldemedine with \n\nmoderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. efavirenz) has not been established and should be used with caution \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, and is therefore \n\nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on naldemedine \n\nNaldemedine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A with some contribution from UGT1A3 and is a \n\nsubstrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nInteractions with CYP3A inhibitors \n\nItraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased exposure to naldemedine 2.9 fold that may result in \n\nan increased risk of adverse reactions. \n\nConcomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors such as grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, \n\nritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and clarithromycin should be avoided. If use with strong \n\nCYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable, monitor for adverse reactions (see section 4.4). \n\nConcomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, may increase the plasma \n\nconcentration of naldemedine. If used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. \n\nThere is no risk of interaction with concomitant use of mild CYP3A inhibitors. \n\n \n\nInteraction with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers \n\nRifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased exposure to naldemedine by 83% . \n\nConcomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers such as St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), \nrifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin is not recommended. Concomitant use of \n\nnaldemedine with moderate inducers (e.g. efavirenz) has not been established, and patients should be \n\nmonitored (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInteraction with strong P-gp inhibitors \n\nConcomitant use of P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine may increase plasma concentrations of \n\nnaldemedine. If naldemedine is used with strong P-gp inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data from the use of naldemedine in pregnant women. \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n\n(see section 5.3). \n\nThe use of naldemedine during pregnancy may precipitate opioid withdrawal in a fetus due to the \n\nimmature fetal blood brain barrier. \n\nNaldemedine should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \n\ntreatment with naldemedine. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether naldemedine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in rats \n\nhave shown excretion of naldemedine in milk (see section 5.3).  \n\nAt therapeutic doses, most opioids (e.g morphine, meperidine, methadone) are excreted into breast \n\nmilk in minimal amounts. There is a theoretical possibility that naldemedine provokes opioid \n\nwithdrawal in a breast-fed neonate whose mother is taking an opioid receptor agonist. \n\nA risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. \n\nNaldemedine should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo human data on the effect of naldemedine on fertility are available. Naldemedine was found to have \n\nno clinically relevant adverse effects on fertility or reproductive performance in male and female rats \n\n(see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNaldemedine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC were \n\nabdominal pain (7.8%), diarrhoea (5.9%), nausea (3.6%), and vomiting (1.1%). The majority of these \n\ngastrointestinal adverse reactions were of mild to moderate severity and resolved without \n\ndiscontinuation of naldemedine treatment. One serious case of abdominal pain and one serious case of \n\nnausea were reported in patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC. \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients with cancer and OIC were diarrhoea \n\n(24.5%) and abdominal pain (3.9%). The majority of these gastrointestinal adverse reactions were of \n\nmild to moderate severity and resolved with treatment. Two serious cases of diarrhoea were reported \n\nin patients with cancer and OIC. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions with naldemedine 200 microgram tablets in patients with chronic non-cancer \n\npain and OIC and in patients with cancer and OIC reported in clinical studies are presented in the \n\ntables according to the MedDRA system organ classification. The frequency categories are defined \n\nusing the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known \n(frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \n\nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 1.

Symptoms included, but were not limited to \n\nhyperhidrosis, chills, lacrimation increased, hot flush/flushing, pyrexia, sneezing, feeling cold, \n\nabdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, and tachycardia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nAbdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported adverse reactions \n\nin clinical studies with patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC and with patients with cancer \n\nand OIC. The majority of these gastrointestinal adverse reactions were mild to moderate severity and \n\nresolved with treatment. The discontinuation rate due to gastrointestinal treatment emergent adverse \n\nevents with naldemedine 200 micrograms compared to placebo was 3.2% and 1% respectively in \n\npatients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC and 4.5% and 0% respectively for patients with cancer \n\nand OIC. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n7 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nHealthy volunteers \n\nA single dose of naldemedine up to 100 mg and multiple doses of up to 30 mg/day for 10 days were \n\nadministered to healthy volunteers in clinical studies. Dose-dependent increases in \n\ngastrointestinal-related adverse reactions, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and nausea, were \n\nobserved. These were mild or moderate in severity and resolved. \n\n \n\nPatients with OIC \n\nA single dose of naldemedine (0.01 mg to 3 mg) and multiple doses of 0.4 mg/day have been \n\nadministered to patients with OIC in clinical studies. A patient who took a single dose of naldemedine \n\n1 mg experienced severe drug withdrawal syndrome, including nausea and stomach cramping and was \n\ngiven esomeprazole and ondansetron for nausea and midazolam hydrochloride for stomach cramping. \n\nThe symptoms resolved. In clinical studies, patients with OIC who were administered 0.4 mg/day \n\n(twice the recommended dose) over 4 weeks had an increased incidence of GI-related adverse drug \n\nreactions including diarrhoea and abdominal pain frequently within 1-2 days after initial dosing. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nThere is no specific antidote for naldemedine. Naldemedine is not removed from the body by \n\nhaemodialysis. In the event of an overdose, patients should be closely monitored for potential signs \n\nand symptoms of opioid withdrawal syndrome (see section 4.4) and provided with appropriate \n\nsupportive care. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for constipation, peripheral opioid receptor antagonists, ATC code: \n\nA06AH05. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nNaldemedine is an antagonist of opioid binding at the mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors. \n\nNaldemedine functions as a peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist in tissues such as the \n\ngastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids without reversing the \n\ncentral nervous system (CNS)-mediated opioid effects. \n\nNaldemedine is a derivative of naltrexone to which a side chain has been added that increases the \n\nmolecular weight and the polar surface area, thereby reducing its ability to cross the blood-brain \n\nbarrier (BBB); the CNS penetration of naldemedine is expected to be negligible at the recommended \n\ndose. Additionally, naldemedine is a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter, which \n\nmay also be involved in reducing naldemedine penetration into the CNS. Based on this, naldemedine \n\nis expected to exert its anti-constipating effects on opioids without reversing their CNS-mediated \n\nanalgesic effects. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe efficacy and safety of naldemedine has been established in patients with chronic non-cancer pain \n\nand OIC and in patients with cancer and OIC. \n\n \n\nClinical studies in patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC \nThe safety and efficacy of naldemedine was evaluated in two identical, 12-week randomised, double-\nblind placebo-controlled trials (Studies V9231 and V9232) in which naldemedine was used without \nlaxatives and in a third long-term 52-week randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial (Study \nV9235) in which naldemedine was used with or without stable laxatives in patients with chronic non-\ncancer pain and OIC. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nPatients receiving a stable opioid morphine equivalent daily dose of \u2265 30 mg for at least 4 weeks \nbefore enrollment and self-reported OIC were eligible to participate. \n \n\nIn Studies V9231 and V9232, OIC was confirmed through a 2-week run-in period and was defined as \nno more than 4 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) total over 14 consecutive days and <3 SBMs \nin a given week with at least 25% of the SBMs associated with one or more of the following \nconditions: (1) straining, (2) hard or lumpy stools; (3) having a sensation of incomplete evacuation; \nand (4) having a sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage. In Study V9235, OIC was confirmed \nthrough a 2-week run-in period and was defined as no more than 4 SBMs total over 14 consecutive \ndays and <3 SBMs in a given week. \n \n\nA SBM was defined as a bowel movement (BM) without rescue laxative taken within the past \n24 hours. \n \n\nIn Studies V9231 and V9232, patients had to either not be using laxatives or be willing to discontinue \n\nlaxative use at the time of Screening and be willing to use only the provided rescue laxatives during \n\nthe Screening and Treatment Periods. All study participants took laxatives previously for the treatment \n\nof OIC. In Study V9235, patients on a stable laxative regimen at screening (52.4%) were allowed to \n\ncontinue using that same regimen without change throughout the study duration. In the run-in and \n\ntreatment periods for all three studies, bisacodyl was used as rescue laxative if patients had not had a \n\nBM for 72 hours and were allowed one-time use of an enema if after 24 hours of taking bisacodyl, \n\nthey still had not had a BM. \n\n \n\nPatients with evidence of significant structural abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract were not \nenrolled in these studies. \n \n\nA total of 547 patients in Study V9231, 551 patients in Study V9232 and 1246 patients in Study \nV9235 were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive 200 micrograms of naldemedine or placebo once \ndaily for 12 weeks for Studies V9231 and V9232, for 52 weeks for Study V9235. \n \n\nIn Studies V9231, V9232 and V9235, the mean age of the subjects in these three studies was \n53.2 years; 14.8% were 65 years of age or older; 62.0% were women; 80.2% were white. \n \n\nIn Study V9231, the three most common types of pain were back pain (62.0%); neck pain (8.3%) and \nosteoarthritis (5.3%). In Study V9232, they were back pain (53.6%); pain (10.2%) and arthralgia \n(7.8%). In Study V9235, the three most common types of pain were back pain (58.0%); osteoarthritis \n(9.5%) and neck pain (8.1%). \n \n\nPrior to enrollment, patients had been using their current opioid for an average of 5 years. The patients \nwho participated in Studies V9231, V9232 and V9235 were taking a wide range of opioids. \nThe mean baseline opioid morphine equivalent daily dosage was 132.42 mg, 120.93 mg, and \n122.06 mg per day for Studies V9231, V9232 and V9235 respectively. The mean baseline SBMs was \n1.31, 1.17, and 1.60, for Studies V9231, V9232 and V9235 respectively. \n \n\nThe primary endpoint for Studies V9231 and V9232 was the proportion of SBM responders, defined \nas: \u22653 SBMs per week and a change from baseline of \u22651 SBM per week for at least 9 out of the \n12 study weeks and 3 out of the last 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint for Study V9235 was the \nchange in the frequency of BMs per week from baseline to Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52. \n \n\nThere was a statistically significant difference for naldemedine treatment group versus placebo for the \nprimary endpoint in Studies V9231 and V9232 (see Table 3). \n \n\nThere were 4 secondary endpoints in Studies V9231 and V9232 (see Table 3). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 3.

The number of patients in the LIR and \n\nnon-LIR subgroups were 629 (naldemedine: 317 and placebo: 312) and 451 (naldemedine: 223 and \n\nplacebo: 228) for pooled Studies V9231 and V9232. All study participants took previous laxatives at \n\nsome time for the treatment of OIC prior to entering the trials V9231 or V9232. \n\n \n\nIn the LIR subgroup, a greater proportion of responders was observed with naldemedine (46.4%) \n\ncompared with placebo (30.2%) and the difference between groups (16.2%) was statistically \n\nsignificant (p<0.0001).  \n\n \n\nIn the non-LIR subgroup, consistent with the results in the LIR subgroup, a greater proportion of \n\nresponders was observed with naldemedine (54.3%) compared with placebo (38.9%) and the \n\ndifference between groups (15.6%) was statistically significant (p=0.0009). \n\n \n\nFor Study V9235, long term efficacy data defined as the change in frequency of BMs at week 52 from \nbaseline, assessed as a secondary endpoint, showed that subjects in the naldemedine group had \nimprovements in the frequency of BMs compared with subjects in the placebo group in both LIR (3.10 \nvs 1.90, p=0.0210) and non-LIR (4.26 vs 3.39, p=0.1349) subgroups.  \n \n\nClinical studies in patients with cancer and OIC \nThe safety and efficacy of naldemedine was also evaluated in 2 randomised, double-blind and placebo-\ncontrolled studies (V9222 and V9236) in patients with cancer and OIC. \n\n \n\nSubjects were required to be treated with opioids for \u226514 days prior to Screening and had to be \nreceiving a stable dose. The studies included a 2-week Screening Period, 2-week Treatment Period and \n\n4-week Follow-up Period. For patients receiving laxative therapy at the Screening visit, it had to be \n\ncontinued at a stable dose until the end of the Treatment Period. Patients were allowed to receive \n\nrescue laxative(s) as needed regardless of being on a stable laxative regimen at baseline (apart from \n\nwithin 24 hours of the start of the Treatment Period). \n\n \n\nIn studies V9222 and V9236, OIC was confirmed through a 2-week run-in period and was defined as \n\n\u22645 SBMs during the 14 consecutive days prior to the randomisation and \u22651 of the following bowel \nsymptoms in \u226525% of all BMs regardless of the use of rescue laxatives: presence of straining during \nbowel movement, feeling of incomplete evacuation, passage of hard stools or small pellets. \n\n \n\nIn studies V9222 and V9236, the mean age of the subjects was 64.3 years; 51.8% were 65 years of age \n\nor older; 39.4% were women and 97.1% were Japanese. \n\n \n\nNaldemedine 200 micrograms or placebo was administered for 2 weeks to cancer patients with OIC. \nThe primary endpoint for Study V9236 and the secondary endpoint, without multiplicity adjustment, \n\nfor Study V9222 were the proportion of SBM responders during the 2-week Treatment Period. A \n\nresponder was defined as a patient with \u22653 frequency of SBMs per week and an increase from baseline \n\u22651 SBM per week during the 2-week Treatment Period \n \n\nTable 5.

The absolute bioavailability of naldemedine has not been established. \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of naldemedine is estimated to be in the range of 20% to 56%. \n\n \n\nThere is no clinically significant food effect. The peak plasma concentration was reduced by 35% and \n\ntime to achieve peak plasma concentration was delayed from 0.75 hours in the fasted state to 2.5 hours \n\nin the fed state, whereas no significant difference was observed in the area under the plasma \n\nconcentration-time curve by food intake. Based on these data, naldemedine can be taken with or \n\nwithout food (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nNaldemedine is highly bound to serum proteins, predominantly to human serum albumin and to a \n\nlesser extent to \u03b11-acid-glycoprotein and \u03b3-globulin, with a mean protein binding ratio in humans of \n93.2%. The apparent volume of distribution is approximately 155 litres. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nNaldemedine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A to nor-naldemedine, with a minor contribution from \n\nUGT1A3 to form naldemedine 3-G. \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration of [14C]-labelled naldemedine, the primary metabolite in plasma was \n\nnor-naldemedine, with a relative exposure compared to naldemedine of approximately 9 to 13%. \n\nNaldemedine 3-G was a minor metabolite in plasma, with a relative exposure to naldemedine of less \n\nthan 3%. \n\n \n\nNaldemedine also undergoes cleavage in the gastrointestinal tract to form benzamidine and \n\nnaldemedine carboxylic acid. \n\n \n\nIn in vitro studies at clinically relevant concentrations, naldemedine did not inhibit the major CYP \n\nenzymes (including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, \n\nCYP2E1, CYP3A, or CYP4A11 isozymes) and is not an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, \n\nOAT3, OCT1, OCT2, BCRP, P-gp, MATE1, MATE2-K or BSEP transporters. Naldemedine did not \n\ncause significant induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 isozymes. Therefore, treatment with \n\nnaldemedine is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medicines that are \n\nsubstrates of these enzymes and transporters.  \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe apparent terminal elimination half-life of naldemedine is approximately 11 hours, and the \n\napparent total clearance (CL/F) of naldemedine is 8.4 L/h. Following oral administration of radio-\n\nlabelled naldemedine, 57.3% and 34.8% of the dose was excreted in urine and faeces for the \n\n[oxadiazole-\n14\n\nC]-naldemedine and 20.4% and 64.3% of the dose was excreted as the [carbonyl-\n14\n\nC]-\n\nnaldemedine in urine and faeces, respectively. Approximately 20% of the naldemedine dose is \n\nexcreted unchanged in urine. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nThe peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve increased in an \n\nalmost dose-proportional manner within the dose range of 0.1 to 100 mg. A slight accumulation \n\n(1 to 1.3-fold) for peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve was \nobserved after once daily multiple dose administration in the fasted state for 10 days. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in subpopulations \n\nAge, gender, body weight and race \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis from clinical studies with naldemedine did not identify a \n\nclinically meaningful effect of age, gender, body weight or race on the pharmacokinetics of \n\nnaldemedine. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of naldemedine in the paediatric population has not been studied (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of naldemedine after administration of a single 200 microgram dose of \n\nnaldemedine was studied in subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, or with end-\n\nstage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, and compared with healthy subjects with normal \n\nrenal function. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of naldemedine between subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal \n\nimpairment, or subjects with ESRD requiring hemodialysis and healthy subjects with normal renal \n\nfunction were similar. \n\n \n\nPlasma concentrations of naldemedine in subjects with ESRD requiring dialysis were similar when \n\nnaldemedine was administered either pre- or post-haemodialysis, indicating that naldemedine was not \n\nremoved from the blood by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of a single 200 microgram dose of \n\nnaldemedine was studied in subjects with hepatic impairment classified as mild (Child-Pugh class A) \n\nor moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and compared with healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of naldemedine between subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and \n\nhealthy subjects with normal hepatic function were similar. The effect of severe hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of naldemedine was not evaluated. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and embryo-fetal \n\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nIn the rat fertility and early embryonic development study, prolongation of the dioestrous phase was \n\nobserved at 10 mg/kg/day and above, but was not observed at 1 mg/kg/day (12 times the exposure \n\n[AUC0-24hr] in humans at an oral dose of 200 micrograms). The effect on oestrous cycle is not \n\nconsidered clinically relevant at the proposed therapeutic dose. No adverse effects were observed in \n\nmale or female fertility and reproductive performance at up to 1000 mg/kg/day (in excess of \n\n16,000 times the exposure [AUC0-24hr] in humans at an oral dose of 200 micrograms). \n\n \n\nIn the pre- and postnatal development study in rats, one dam died at parturition at 1000 mg/kg/day, \n\nand poor nursing, suppression of body weight gain and decrease in food consumption were noted at \n\n30 and 1000 mg/kg/day. Decreases in the viability index on Day 4 after birth were noted at 30 and \n\n1000 mg/kg/day and low body weights and delayed pinna unfolding were noted at 1000 mg/kg/day in \n\npups. There was no adverse effect on pre- and postnatal development at 1 mg/kg/day (12 times the \n\nexposure [AUC0-24hr] in humans at an oral dose of 200 micrograms). \n\n \n\nPlacental transfer of [carbonyl-\n14\n\nC]-naldemedine-derived radioactivity was observed in pregnant rats. \n\n[Carbonyl-\n14\n\nC]-naldemedine-derived radioactivity was excreted into milk in lactating rats. \n\n \n\nIn juvenile toxicity studies in rats, at the same dose levels, exposure in juvenile animals (PND 10) was \n\nincreased compared to adult animals (2.3 to 7.4-fold). Novel histopathology findings were observed at \n\n\n\n13 \n\nall doses tested in female rats in ovaries (tertiary follicles/luteal cysts) in addition to irregular oestrous \n\ncycles, hyperplasia of mammary gland, and vaginal mucification already observed in adult animals \n\n(the lowest dose tested corresponded to an exposure margin of 6 or more, depending on the age of the \n\npups). Three-day earlier vaginal opening indicative of an early onset of sexual maturity was also \n\nobserved, but only at high exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human \n\nexposure at an oral dose of 200 micrograms. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Rizmoic is and what it is used for \n\n2.

What Rizmoic is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nRizmoic contains the active substance naldemedine. \n\n \n\nIt is a medicine used in adults to treat constipation caused by pain medicines, called opioids \n\n(e.g morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, tramadol, codeine, hydromorphone, methadone). \n\n \n\nYour opioid pain medicine may cause the following symptoms: \n\n- reduction in how often you pass stools \n\n- hard stools \n\n- stomach ache \n\n- pain in the rectum when pushing hard stools out \n\n- a feeling that the bowel is still not empty after passing stools. \n\n \n\nRizmoic can be used in patients using an opioid medicine for cancer pain or long term non-cancer pain \n\nafter they have previously been treated with a laxative. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rizmoic \n\n \n\nDo not take Rizmoic: \n\n- if you are allergic to naldemedine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if your bowel is blocked or perforated, or if there is a high risk of your bowel becoming \n\nblocked, as a blockage may cause a hole to develop in the bowel wall. \n\nDo not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you.
