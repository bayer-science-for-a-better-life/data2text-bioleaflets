NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZavesca 100 mg capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 100 mg miglustat. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nCapsule, hard \n \nWhite capsules with \u201cOGT 918\u201d printed in black on the cap and \u201c100\u201d printed in black on the body. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZavesca is indicated for the oral treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher \ndisease. Zavesca may be used only in the treatment of patients for whom enzyme replacement therapy \nis unsuitable (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nZavesca is indicated for the treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in adult patients and \npaediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease (see sections 4.4, and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be directed by physicians who are knowledgeable in the management of Gaucher \ndisease or Niemann-Pick type C disease, as appropriate. \n \nPosology \n \nDosage in type 1 Gaucher disease \n \nAdult \nThe recommended starting dose for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease is \n100 mg three times a day. \n \nTemporary dose reduction to 100 mg once or twice a day may be necessary in some patients because \nof diarrhoea. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy of Zavesca in children and adolescents aged 0-17 years with type 1 Gaucher disease has \nnot been established. No data are available. \n \nDosage in Niemann-Pick type C disease \n \nAdult \nThe recommended dose for the treatment of adult patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease is \n200 mg three times a day. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe recommended dose for the treatment of adolescent patients (12 years of age and above) with \nNiemann-Pick type C disease is 200 mg three times a day. \n \nDosing in patients under the age of 12 years should be adjusted on the basis of body surface area as \nillustrated below: \n \n\nBody surface area (m2) Recommended dose \n> 1.25 200 mg three times a day \n> 0.88 - 1.25 200 mg twice a day \n> 0.73 - 0.88 100 mg three times a day \n> 0.47 - 0.73 100 mg twice a day \n\u2264 0.47 100 mg once a day \n\n \nTemporary dose reduction may be necessary in some patients because of diarrhoea. \n \nThe benefit to the patient of treatment with Zavesca should be evaluated on a regular basis (see section \n4.4). \n \nThere is limited experience with the use of Zavesca in Niemann-Pick type C disease patients under the \nage of 4 years. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no experience with the use of Zavesca in patients over the age of 70. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPharmacokinetic data indicate increased systemic exposure to miglustat in patients with renal \nimpairment. In patients with an adjusted creatinine clearance of 50\u201370 ml/min/1.73 m2, administration \nshould commence at a dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and at a \ndose of 200 mg twice daily (adjusted for body surface area in patients below the age of 12) in patients \nwith Niemann-Pick type C disease. \n \nIn patients with an adjusted creatinine clearance of 30\u201350 ml/min/1.73 m2, administration should \ncommence at a dose of 100 mg once daily in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and at a dose of \n100 mg twice daily (adjusted for body surface area in patients below the age of 12) in patients with \nNiemann-Pick type C disease. Use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nZavesca has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nZavesca can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTremor \n\n\n\n4 \n\nApproximately 37% of patients in clinical trials in type 1 Gaucher disease, and 58% of patients in a \nclinical trial in Niemann-Pick type C disease reported tremor on treatment. In type 1 Gaucher disease, \nthese tremors were described as an exaggerated physiological tremor of the hands. Tremor usually \nbegan within the first month, and in many cases resolved during treatment after between 1 and \n3 months. Dose reduction may ameliorate the tremor, usually within days, but discontinuation of \ntreatment may sometimes be required. \n \nGastrointestinal disturbances \nGastrointestinal events, mainly diarrhoea, have been observed in more than 80% of patients, either at \nthe outset of treatment or intermittently during treatment (see section 4.8). The mechanism is most \nlikely inhibition of intestinal disaccharidases such as sucrase-isomaltase in the gastrointestinal tract \nleading to reduced absorption of dietary disaccharides. In clinical practice, miglustat-induced \ngastrointestinal events have been observed to respond to individualised diet modification (for example \nreduction of sucrose, lactose and other carbohydrate intake), to taking Zavesca between meals, and/or \nto anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products such as loperamide. In some patients, temporary dose reduction \nmay be necessary. Patients with chronic diarrhoea or other persistent gastrointestinal events that do not \nrespond to these interventions should be investigated according to clinical practice. Zavesca has not \nbeen evaluated in patients with a history of significant gastrointestinal disease, including inflammatory \nbowel disease. \n \nEffects on spermatogenesis \nMale patients should maintain reliable contraceptive methods while taking Zavesca. Studies in the rat \nhave shown that miglustat adversely affects spermatogenesis and sperm parameters, and reduces \nfertility (see sections 4.6 and  5.3). Until further information is available, before seeking to conceive, \nmale patients should cease Zavesca and maintain reliable contraceptive methods for a further \n3 months. \n \nSpecial populations \nDue to limited experience, Zavesca should be used with caution in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment. There is a close relationship between renal function and clearance of miglustat, and \nexposure to miglustat is markedly increased in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \nAt present, there is insufficient clinical experience in these patients to provide dosing \nrecommendations. Use of Zavesca in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is not recommended. \n \nType 1 Gaucher disease \n \nAlthough no direct comparisons with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) have been performed in \ntreatment-naive patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, there is no evidence of Zavesca having an \nefficacy or safety advantage over ERT. ERT is the standard of care for patients who require treatment \nfor type 1 Gaucher disease (see section 5.1). The efficacy and safety of Zavesca has not been \nspecifically evaluated in patients with severe Gaucher disease. \n \nRegular monitoring of vitamin B12 level is recommended because of the high prevalence of \nvitamin B12 deficiency in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. \n \nCases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients treated with Zavesca with or without \nconcurrent conditions such as vitamin B12 deficiency and monoclonal gammopathy. Peripheral \nneuropathy seems to be more common in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease compared to the \ngeneral population. All patients should undergo baseline and repeat neurological evaluation. \n \nIn patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, monitoring of platelet counts is recommended. Mild \nreductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in patients with type 1 \nGaucher disease who were switched from ERT to Zavesca. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nNiemann-Pick type C disease \n \nThe benefit of treatment with Zavesca for neurological manifestations in patients with Niemann-Pick \ntype C disease should be evaluated on a regular basis, e.g. every 6 months; continuation of therapy \nshould be re-appraised after at least 1 year of treatment with Zavesca. \n \nMild reductions in platelet counts without association to bleeding were observed in some patients with \nNiemann-Pick type C disease treated with Zavesca. In patients included in the clinical trial, 40%-50% \nof patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of normal at baseline. Monitoring of platelet \ncounts is recommended in these patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nReduced growth has been reported in some paediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease in \nthe early phase of treatment with miglustat where the initial reduced weight gain may be accompanied \nor followed by reduced height gain. Growth should be monitored in paediatric and adolescent patients \nduring treatment with Zavesca; the benefit/risk balance should be re-assessed on an individual basis \nfor continuation of therapy. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLimited data suggest that co-administration of Zavesca and enzyme replacement with imiglucerase in \npatients with type 1 Gaucher disease may result in decreased exposure to miglustat (approximate \nreductions of 22% in Cmax and 14% in AUC were observed in a small parallel-group study). This study \nalso indicated that Zavesca has no or limited effect on the pharmacokinetics of imiglucerase. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of miglustat in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity, including dystocia (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. Miglustat crosses the placenta and should not be used during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known if miglustat is secreted in breast milk. Zavesca should not be taken during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nStudies in the rat have shown that miglustat adversely affects sperm parameters (motility and \nmorphology) thereby reducing fertility (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). Until further information is \navailable, it is advised that before seeking to conceive, male patients should cease Zavesca and \nmaintain reliable contraceptive methods for 3 months thereafter. \n \nContraceptive measures should be used by women of childbearing potential. Male patients should \nmaintain reliable contraceptive methods while taking Zavesca (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZavesca has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has been reported \nas a common adverse reaction, and patients suffering from dizziness should not drive or use machines. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with Zavesca were diarrhoea, \nflatulence, abdominal pain, weight loss and tremor (see section 4.4). The most common serious \nadverse reaction reported with Zavesca treatment in clinical studies was peripheral neuropathy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn 11 clinical trials in different indications 247 patients were treated with Zavesca at dosages of \n50-200 mg t.i.d. for an average duration of 2.1 years. Of these patients, 132 had type 1 Gaucher \ndisease, and 40 had Niemann-Pick type C disease. Adverse reactions were generally of mild to \nmoderate severity and occurred with similar frequency across indications and dosages tested. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials and spontaneous reporting, occurring in >1% of patients, are \nlisted in the table below by system organ class and frequency (very common: \u2265  1/10, common: \n\u2265 1/100 < 1/10, uncommon: \u22651/1,000 to <1/100, rare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000, very rare: <1/10,000). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon   Thrombocytopenia \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common  Weight loss, decreased appetite \n \nPsychiatric disorders  \nCommon   Depression, insomnia, libido decreased \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common  Tremor \nCommon   Peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, amnesia, paraesthesia,  \n    hypoaesthesia, headache, dizziness \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common  Diarrhoea, flatulence, abdominal pain \nCommon   Nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension/discomfort, constipation, \n    dyspepsia \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon   Muscle spasms, muscle weakness \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site reactions \nCommon    Fatigue, asthenia, chills and malaise \n \nInvestigations \nCommon   Nerve conduction studies abnormal \n \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nWeight loss has been reported in 55% of patients. The greatest prevalence was observed between \n6 and 12 months. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nZavesca has been studied in indications where certain events reported as adverse reactions, such as \nneurological and neuropsychological symptoms/signs, cognitive dysfunction and thrombocytopenia \ncould also be due to the underlying conditions. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nNo acute symptoms of overdose have been identified. Zavesca has been administered at doses of up to \n3000 mg/day for up to six months in HIV positive patients during clinical trials. Adverse events \nobserved included granulocytopenia, dizziness and paraesthesia. Leukopenia and neutropenia have \nalso been observed in a similar group of patients receiving 800 mg/day or higher dose. \n \nManagement \nIn case of overdose general medical care is recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC Code: A16AX06 \n \nType 1 Gaucher disease \n \nGaucher disease is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a failure to degrade glucosylceramide \nresulting in lysosomal storage of this material and widespread pathology. Miglustat is an inhibitor of \nglucosylceramide synthase, the enzyme responsible for the first step in the synthesis of most \nglycolipids. In vitro, glucosylceramide synthase is inhibited by miglustat with an IC50 of 20-37 \u00b5M. In \naddition, inhibitory action on a non-lysosomal glycosylceramidase has been demonstrated \nexperimentally in vitro. The inhibitory action on glucosylceramide synthase forms the rationale for \nsubstrate reduction therapy in Gaucher disease. \n \nThe pivotal trial of Zavesca was conducted in patients unable or unwilling to receive ERT. Reasons \nfor not receiving ERT included the burden of intravenous infusions and difficulties in venous access. \nTwenty-eight patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease were enrolled in this 12-month \nnon-comparative study, and 22 patients completed the study. At 12 months, there was a mean \nreduction in liver organ volume of 12.1% and a mean reduction in spleen volume of 19.0%. A mean \nincrease in haemoglobin concentration of 0.26 g/dl and a mean platelet count increase of 8.29 \u00d7 109/l \nwere observed. Eighteen patients then continued to receive Zavesca under an optional extended \ntreatment protocol. Clinical benefit has been assessed at 24 and 36 months in 13 patients. After 3 years \nof continuous Zavesca treatment, mean reductions in liver and spleen organ volume were 17.5% and \n29.6%, respectively. There was a mean increase of 22.2 \u00d7 109/l in platelet count, and a mean increase \nof 0.95 g/dl in haemoglobin concentration. \n \nA second open, controlled study randomised 36 patients who had received a minimum of 2 years of \ntreatment with ERT, into three treatment groups: continuation with imiglucerase, imiglucerase in \ncombination with Zavesca, or switch to Zavesca. This study was conducted over a 6-month \nrandomised comparison period followed by 18 months extension where all patients received Zavesca \nmonotherapy. In the first 6 months in patients who were switched to Zavesca, liver and spleen organ \nvolumes and haemoglobin levels were unchanged. In some patients there were reductions in platelet \ncount and increases in chitotriosidase activity indicating that Zavesca monotherapy may not maintain \n\n\n\n8 \n\nthe same control of disease activity in all patients. 29 patients continued in the extension period. When \ncompared to the measurements at 6 months, disease control was unchanged after 18 and 24 months of \nZavesca monotherapy (20 and 6 patients, respectively). No patient showed rapid deterioration of type \n1 Gaucher disease following the switch to Zavesca monotherapy. \n \nA total daily dose of 300 mg Zavesca administered in three divided doses was used in the above two \nstudies. An additional monotherapy study was performed in 18 patients at a total daily dose of 150 mg, \nand results indicate reduced efficacy compared to a total daily dose of 300 mg. \n \nAn open-label, non-comparative, 2-year study enrolled 42 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, who \nhad received a minimum of 3 years of ERT and who fulfilled criteria of stable disease for at least 2 \nyears. The patients were switched to monotherapy with miglustat 100 mg t.i.d. Liver volume (primary \nefficacy variable) was unchanged from baseline to the end of treatment. Six patients had miglustat \ntreatment prematurely discontinued for potential disease worsening, as defined in the study. Thirteen \npatients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Small mean reductions in haemoglobin [\u2013\n0.95 g/dL (95% CI: \u20131.38, \u20130.53)] and platelet count [-44.1 \u00d7 109/L (95% CI: \u201357.6, \u201330.7)] were \nobserved between baseline and end of study. Twenty-one patients completed 24 months of miglustat \ntreatment. Of these, 18 patients at baseline were within established therapeutic goals for liver and \nspleen volume, haemoglobin levels, and platelet counts, and 16 patients remained within all these \ntherapeutic goals at Month 24. \n \nBone manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease were evaluated in 3 open-label clinical studies in \npatients treated with miglustat 100 mg t.i.d. for up to 2 years (n = 72). In a pooled analysis of \nuncontrolled data, bone mineral density Z-scores at the lumbar spine and femoral neck increased by \nmore than 0.1 units from baseline in 27 (57%) and 28 (65%) of the patients with longitudinal bone \ndensity measurements. There were no events of bone crisis, avascular necrosis or fracture during the \ntreatment period. \n \nNiemann-Pick type C disease \n \nNiemann-Pick type C disease is a very rare, invariably progressive and eventually fatal \nneurodegenerative disorder characterised by impaired intracellular lipid trafficking. The neurological \nmanifestations are considered secondary to the abnormal accumulation of glycosphingolipids in \nneuronal and glial cells. \n \nData to support safety and efficacy of Zavesca in Niemann-Pick type C disease come from a \nprospective open-label clinical trial and a retrospective survey. The clinical trial included 29 adult and \njuvenile patients in a 12-month controlled period, followed by extension therapy for an average total \nduration of 3.9 years and up to 5.6 years. In addition 12 paediatric patients were enrolled in an \nuncontrolled substudy for an overall average duration of 3.1 years and up to 4.4 years. Among the 41 \npatients enrolled in the trial 14 patients were treated with Zavesca for more than 3 years. The survey \nincluded a case series of 66 patients treated with Zavesca outside of the clinical trial for a mean \nduration of 1.5 years. Both data sets included paediatric, adolescent and adult patients with an age \nrange of 1 year to 43 years. The usual dose of Zavesca in adult patients was 200 mg t.i.d., and was \nadjusted according to body surface area in paediatric patients. \n \nOverall the data show that treatment with Zavesca can reduce the progression of clinically relevant \nneurological symptoms in patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease. \n \nThe benefit of treatment with Zavesca for neurological manifestations in patients with Niemann-Pick \ntype C disease should be evaluated on a regular basis, e.g. every 6 months; continuation of therapy \nshould be re-appraised after at least 1 year of treatment with Zavesca, (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters of miglustat were assessed in healthy subjects, in a small number of \npatients with type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, HIV-infected patients, and in adults, adolescents \nand children with Niemann-Pick type C disease or type 3 Gaucher disease. \n \nThe kinetics of miglustat appear to be dose linear and time independent. In healthy subjects miglustat \nis rapidly absorbed. Maximum plasma concentrations are reached about 2 hours after dose. Absolute \nbioavailability has not been determined. Concomitant administration of food decreases the rate of \nabsorption (Cmax was decreased by 36% and tmax delayed 2 hours), but has no statistically significant \neffect on the extent of absorption of miglustat (AUC decreased by 14%). \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of miglustat is 83 l. Miglustat does not bind to plasma proteins. \nMiglustat is mainly eliminated by renal excretion, with urinary recovery of unchanged drug \naccounting for 70-80% of the dose. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) is 230 \u00b1 39 ml/min. The average \nhalf-life is 6\u20137 hours. \n \nFollowing administration of a single dose of 100 mg 14C-miglustat to healthy volunteers, 83% of the \nradioactivity was recovered in urine and 12% in faeces. Several metabolites were identified in urine \nand faeces. The most abundant metabolite in urine was miglustat glucuronide accounting for 5% of the \ndose. The terminal half-life of radioactivity in plasma was 150 h suggesting the presence of one or \nmore metabolites with very long half-life. The metabolite accounting for this has not been identified, \nbut may accumulate and reach concentrations exceeding those of miglustat at steady state. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of miglustat is similar in adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients and \nNiemann-Pick type C disease patients when compared to healthy subjects. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPharmacokinetic data were obtained in paediatric patients with type 3 Gaucher disease aged 3 to \n15 years, and patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease aged 5\u201316 years. Dosing in children at 200 \nmg t.i.d. adjusted for body surface area resulted in Cmax and AUC\u03c4 values which were approximately \ntwo-fold those attained after 100 mg t.i.d. in type 1 Gaucher disease patients, consistent with the \ndose-linear pharmacokinetics of miglustat. At steady state, the concentration of miglustat in \ncerebrospinal fluid of six type 3 Gaucher disease patients was 31.4\u201367.2% of that in plasma. \n \nLimited data in patients with Fabry disease and impaired renal function showed that CL/F decreases \nwith decreasing renal function. While the numbers of subjects with mild and moderate renal \nimpairment were very small, the data suggest an approximate decrease in CL/F of 40% and 60% \nrespectively, in mild and moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2). Data in severe renal impairment \nare limited to two patients with creatinine clearance in the range 18 \u2013 29 ml/min and cannot be \nextrapolated below this range. These data suggest a decrease in CL/F by at least 70% in patients with \nsevere renal impairment. \n \nOver the range of data available, no significant relationships or trends were noted between miglustat \npharmacokinetic parameters and demographic variables (age, BMI, gender or race). \n \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data available in patients with liver impairment or in the elderly \n(> 70 years). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe main effects common to all species were weight loss and diarrhoea, and, at higher doses, damage \nto the gastrointestinal mucosa (erosions and ulceration). Further effects seen in animals at doses that \nresult in exposure levels similar to or moderately higher than the clinical exposure level were: changes \nin lymphoid organs in all species tested, transaminase changes, vacuolation of thyroid and pancreas, \n\n\n\n10 \n\ncataracts, nephropathy and myocardial changes in rats. These findings were considered to be \nsecondary to debilitation. \n \nAdministration of miglustat to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats by oral gavage for 2 years at \ndose levels of 30, 60 and 180 mg/kg/day resulted in an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell \n(Leydig cell) hyperplasia and adenomas in male rats at all dose levels. The systemic exposure at the \nlowest dose was below or comparable to that observed in humans (based on AUC0-\u221e) at the \nrecommended human dose. A No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was not established and the effect \nwas not dose dependent. There was no drug-related increase in tumour incidence in male or female \nrats in any other organ. Mechanistic studies revealed a rat specific mechanism which is considered to \nbe of low relevance for humans. \n \nAdministration of miglustat to male and female CD1 mice by oral gavage at dose levels of 210, 420 \nand 840/500 mg/kg/day (dose reduction after half a year) for 2 years resulted in an increased incidence \nof inflammatory and hyperplastic lesions in the large intestine in both sexes. Based on mg/kg/day and \ncorrected for differences in faecal excretion, the doses corresponded to 8, 16 and 33/19 times the \nhighest recommended human dose (200 mg t.i.d.). Carcinomas in the large intestine occurred \noccasionally at all doses with a statistically significant increase in the high dose group. A relevance of \nthese findings to humans cannot be excluded. There was no drug-related increase in tumour incidence \nin any other organ. \n \nMiglustat did not show any potential for mutagenic or clastogenic effects in the standard battery of \ngenotoxicity tests. \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats showed effects on the seminiferous epithelium of the testes. \nOther studies revealed changes in sperm parameters (motility and morphology) consistent with an \nobserved reduction in fertility. These effects occurred at exposure levels similar to those in patients, \nbut showed reversibility. Miglustat affected embryo/foetal survival in rats and rabbits, dystocia was \nreported, post-implantation losses were increased, and an increased incidence of vascular anomalies \noccurred in rabbits. These effects may be partly related to maternal toxicity. \n \nChanges in lactation were observed in female rats in a 1-year study. The mechanism for this effect is \nunknown. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects,talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Zavesca is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Zavesca \n3. How to take Zavesca \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zavesca \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zavesca is and what it is used for \n \nZavesca contains the active substance miglustat which belongs to a group of medicines that affect \nmetabolism. It is used to treat two conditions: \n \n\u2022 Zavesca is used to treat mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease in adults. \n \nIn type 1 Gaucher disease, a substance called glucosylceramide is not removed from your body. It \nstarts to build up in certain cells of the body\u2019s immune system. This can result in liver and spleen \nenlargement, changes in the blood, and bone disease.  \n \nThe usual treatment for type 1 Gaucher disease is enzyme replacement therapy. Zavesca is only used \nwhen a patient is considered unsuitable for treatment with enzyme replacement therapy. \n \n\u2022 Zavesca is also used to treat progressive neurological symptoms in Niemann-Pick type C \n\ndisease in adults and in children. \n \nIf you have Niemann-Pick type C disease, fats such as glycosphingolipids build up in the cells of your \nbrain. This can result in disturbances in neurological functions such as slow eye movements, balance, \nswallowing, and memory, and in seizures. \n \nZavesca works by inhibiting the enzyme called \u2018glucosylceramide synthase\u2019 which is responsible for \nthe first step in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Zavesca \n \nDo not take Zavesca \n- if you are allergic to miglustat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine  \n (listed in section 6) \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zavesca \n- if you suffer from kidney disease \n\n\n\n21 \n\n- if you suffer from liver disease \n \nYour doctor will perform the following tests before treatment and during treatment with Zavesca: \n- an examination to check the nerves in your arms and legs \n- measurement of vitamin B12 levels \n- monitoring growth if you are a child or adolescent with Niemann-Pick type C disease \n- monitoring of blood platelet counts  \n \nThe reason for these tests is that some patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, or \na decrease in body weight, while taking Zavesca. The tests will help the doctor decide whether these \neffects are due to your disease or other existing conditions, or due to side effects of Zavesca (see \nsection 4 for further details). \n \nIf you have diarrhoea, your doctor may ask you to change your diet to reduce your lactose and \ncarbohydrate intake such as sucrose (cane sugar), or not to take Zavesca together with food, or to \ntemporarily reduce your dose. In some cases the doctor may prescribe anti-diarrhoeal medicines such \nas loperamide. If your diarrhoea does not respond to these measures, or if you have any other \nabdominal complaint, consult your doctor. In such case, your doctor may decide to conduct further \ninvestigations. \n \nMale patients should use reliable birth control methods during their treatment with Zavesca, and for \n3 months after finishing treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents (below 18 years old) with type 1 Gaucher \ndisease because it is not known if it works in this disease. \n \nOther medicines and Zavesca \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines containing imiglucerase, which are sometimes used at the \nsame time as Zavesca. They may lower the amount of Zavesca in your body. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nYou should not take Zavesca if you are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant. Your doctor can \ngive you more information. You must use effective birth control while taking Zavesca. Do not \nbreast-feed while you are taking Zavesca. \n \nMale patients should use reliable birth control methods during their treatment with Zavesca, and for \n3 months after finishing treatment. \n \nIf you are pregnant, breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nZavesca may make you feel dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy. \n \n \n3. How to take Zavesca \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \n\u2022 For type 1 Gaucher disease: For adults, the usual dose is one capsule (100 mg) three times a \n\nday (morning, afternoon and evening). This means a daily maximum of three capsules \n(300 mg). \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\u2022 For Niemann-Pick type C disease: For adults and adolescents (over 12 years old), the usual \n\ndose is two capsules (200 mg) three times a day (morning, afternoon and evening). This means \na daily maximum of six capsules (600 mg). \n\n \nFor children less than 12 years old, your doctor will adjust the dose for Niemann-Pick type C disease. \n \nIf you have a problem with your kidneys you may receive a lower starting dose. Your doctor may \nreduce your dose, e.g., to one capsule (100 mg) once or twice a day, if you suffer from diarrhoea when \ntaking Zavesca (see section 4). Your doctor will tell you how long your treatment will last. \n \nTo remove the capsule: \n\n \n1. Separate at perforations \n2. Peel back paper at arrows \n3. Push product through foil \n \nZavesca can be taken with or without food. You should swallow the whole capsule with a glass of \nwater. \n \nIf you take more Zavesca than you should \n\nIf you take more capsules than you were told to, consult your doctor immediately. Zavesca has been \nused in clinical trials at doses ten times higher than the recommended dose: this caused decreases in \nwhite blood cells and other side effects similar to those described in section 4.  \n \nIf you forget to take Zavesca \n\nTake the next capsule at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you stop taking Zavesca \n\nDon\u2019t stop taking Zavesca without talking to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost serious side effects:  \nSome patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet (seen commonly). They could \nbe signs of peripheral neuropathy, due to side effects of Zavesca or they could be due to existing \nconditions. Your doctor will perform some tests before and during treatment with Zavesca to assess \nthis (see section 2).  \n \nIf you do get any of these effects, please seek medical advice from your doctor as soon as \npossible. \n \nIf you get a slight tremor, usually trembling hands, seek medical advice from your doctor as soon \nas possible. The tremor often disappears without needing to stop the treatment. Sometimes your doctor \nwill need to reduce the dose or stop Zavesca treatment to stop the tremor. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nVery common: (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \nThe most common side effects are diarrhoea, flatulence (wind), abdominal (stomach) pain, weight loss \nand decreased appetite. \n \nIf you do lose some weight when you start treatment with Zavesca don\u2019t worry. People usually stop \nlosing weight as treatment goes on. \n \nCommon: (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  \nCommon side effects of treatment include headache, dizziness, paraesthesia (tingling or numbness), \nabnormal coordination, hypoaesthesia (reduced sensation to touch), dyspepsia (heartburn), nausea \n(feeling sick), constipation and vomiting, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (stomach) and \nthrombocytopenia (reduced levels of blood platelets).The neurological symptoms and \nthrombocytopenia could be due to the underlying disease. \n \nOther possible side effects are muscular spasms or weakness, fatigue chills and malaise, depression, \ndifficulty sleeping, forgetfulness, and less libido. \n \nMost patients get one or more of these side effects, usually at the start of treatment or at intervals \nduring treatment. Most cases are mild and disappear quite quickly. If any of these side effects cause \nproblems, consult your doctor. He or she may reduce the dose of Zavesca or recommend other \nmedicines to help control side effects. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Zavesca \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not take this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after \u2018EXP\u2019. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \n \nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

b12 levels - monitoring growth if you are a child or adolescent with niemann-pick type c disease - monitoring of blood platelet counts the reason for these tests is that some patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, or a decrease in body weight, while taking zavesca. the tests will help the doctor decide whether these effects are due to your disease or other existing conditions, or due to side effects of zavesca (see section 4 for further details). if you have diarrhoea, your doctor may ask you to change your diet to reduce your lactose and carbohydrate intake such as sucrose (cane sugar), or not to take zavesca together with food, or to temporarily reduce your dose. in some cases the doctor may prescribe anti-diarrhoeal medicines such as loperamide. if your diarrhoea does not respond to these measures, or if you have any other abdominal complaint, consult your doctor. in such case, your doctor may decide to conduct further investigations. male

medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. most serious side effects: some patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet (seen commonly). they could be signs of peripheral neuropathy, due to side effects of zavesca or they could be due to existing conditions. your doctor will perform some tests before and during treatment with zavesca to assess this (see section 2). if you do get any of these effects, please seek medical advice from your doctor as soon as possible. if you get a slight tremor, usually trembling hands, seek medical advice from your doctor as soon as possible. the tremor often disappears without needing to stop the treatment. sometimes your doctor will need to reduce the dose or stop zavesca treatment to stop the tremor. very common: (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) the most common side effects are diarrhoea, flatulence (wind), abdominal (stomach) pain, weight loss and decreased appetite. if you do lose some weight when you start treatment with zavesca don't worry. people usually stop losing weight as treatment goes on. common: (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) common side effects of treatment include headache, dizziness, paraesthesia (tingling or numbness), abnormal coordination, hypoaesthesia (reduced sensation to touch), dyspepsia (heartburn), nausea (feeling sick), constipation and vomiting, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (stomach) and thrombocytopenia (reduced levels of blood platelets).the neurological symptoms and thrombocytopenia could be due to the underlying disease. other possible side effects are muscular spasms or weakness, fatigue chills and malaise, depression, difficulty sleeping, forgetfulness, and less libido. most patients get one or more of these side effects, usually at the start of treatment or at intervals during treatment. most cases are mild and disappear quite quickly. if any of these side effects cause problems, consult your doctor. he or she may reduce the dose of zavesca or recommend other medicines to help control side effects. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "zavesca", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "all medicines", "Type":
