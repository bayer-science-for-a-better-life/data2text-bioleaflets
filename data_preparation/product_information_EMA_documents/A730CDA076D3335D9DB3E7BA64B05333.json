NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER \nSuspension for injection \nPandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (whole virion, inactivated, prepared in cell culture) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInfluenza vaccine (whole virion, inactivated) containing antigen * of: \nA/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) 7.5 micrograms**per \n0.5 ml dose \n \n* produced in Vero cells \n** haemagglutinin \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic. \n \nThe vaccine is available in a multidose container (see section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nThe vaccine is an off-white, opalescent, translucent suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. Pandemic influenza vaccine \nshould be used in accordance with official guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdults and children from 6 months onwards: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \n \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunization should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh, depending on the muscle mass. \n \nFor further information, see section 5.1. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to the active substance, to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1 or to trace residues (e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) of this \nvaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that \nfacilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSee section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\n• Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following use of \na similar whole virion, Vero cell derived H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during \na pandemic period. Such reactions occurred both in patients with a history of multiple \nallergies and in patients with no known allergy. \n\n \n• Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known \n\nhypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the \nexcipients and to trace residues e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, or sucrose. \n\n \n• As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should \n\nalways be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the \nadministration of the vaccine. \n\n \n• If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe \n\nfebrile illness or acute infection. \n \n• PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should under no circumstances \n\nbe administered intravascularly. \n \n• There are no data with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER using the \n\nsubcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and \npotential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any \nbleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential \nbenefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n\n \n• Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may \n\nbe insufficient. \n \n• A protective response may not be induced in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n\n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n• PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should not be given at the same \ntime as other vaccines. However, if co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, \nimmunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse \nreactions may be intensified. \n\n \n• Immunoglobulin is not to be given with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE \n\nH5N1 BAXTER. If it is necessary to provide immediate protection, PANDEMIC \nINFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be given at the same time as normal \nor specific immunoglobulin. Injections of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE \nH5N1 BAXTER and immunoglobulin should be made into separate limbs. \n\n \n• The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing \n\nimmunosuppressant treatment. \n \n• Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA \n\nmethod to detect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been \nobserved. The Western Blot technique disproves the results. The transient false positive \nreactions could be due to the IgM response by the vaccine. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe safety of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER in pregnancy and lactation has \nnot been assessed in clinical trials. Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated \nnon-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest malformations or foetal or neonatal toxicity. \n \nAnimal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with H5N1 strain vaccines \n(A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects \nwith respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). \n \nThe use of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be considered during \npregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into account official recommendations. \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be used in lactating women. \n \nHealth care providers should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific \npatient before administering PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 such as dizziness and vertigo may affect the \nability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nAdults, older people and special risk groups \n \nClinical trials were conducted with this H5N1 vaccine (see section 5.1 for more information on \nthe H5N1 vaccines) in approximately 3500 subjects (ranging in age groups from 18 to 59 years \nand 60 years and above) and special risk groups of approximately 300 subjects each, consisting of \nimmunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions. \n \nThe safety profile in immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions is \nsimilar to the safety profile in healthy adults and older subjects. \n \nInfants, children, and adolescents \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years: \nIn a clinical trial 300 adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 153 children aged 3 to 8 years were \nadministered the H5N1 vaccine. The incidence and nature of symptoms after the first and second \nvaccination were similar to those observed in the healthy adults and older subjects. \n \nInfants and children aged 6 to 35 months: \nIn a clinical trial the H5N1 vaccine was administered to 36 infants and children aged 6 to 35 months. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency below. \n \nSummary of adverse reactions \n \nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nAdults and older people: \n \n\nAdverse Reactions (Adults and Older People) \nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Preferred MedDRA Term Frequency \n\nINFECTIONS AND \nINFESTATIONS \n\nNasopharyngitis Common \n\nBLOOD AND LYMPHATIC \nSYSTEM DISORDERS \n\nLymphadenopathy Uncommon \n\nPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS Insomnia Uncommon \nNERVOUS SYSTEM \nDISORDERS \n\nHeadache \nDizziness \nSomnolence \nSensory disturbance (paresthesia, dysesthesia, \noral dysesthesia, hypoesthesia, dysgeusia, and \nburning sensation) \nSyncope \n\nVery common \nUncommon \nUncommon \nCommon \n \n \nUncommon \n\nEYE DISORDERS Conjunctivitis \nEye irritation \n\nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nEAR AND LABYRINTH \nDISORDERS \n\nVertigo \nEar pain \nSudden hearing loss \n\nCommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nVASCULAR DISORDERS Hypotension Uncommon \nRESPIRATORY, THORACIC \nAND MEDIASTINAL \nDISORDERS \n\nOropharyngeal pain \nCough \nDyspnea \nNasal congestion \nRhinorrhea \nDry throat \n\nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nGASTROINTESTINAL \nDISORDERS \n\nDiarrhea \nVomiting \nNausea \nAbdominal pain \nDyspepsia \n\nCommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nSKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS \nTISSUE DISORDERS \n\nHyperhidrosis \nPruritis \nRash \nUrticaria \n\nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\nMUSCULOSKELETAL AND \nCONNECTIVE TISSUE \nDISORDERS \n\nArthralgia \nMyalgia \n\nCommon \nCommon \n\nGENERAL DISORDERS AND \nADMINISTRATION SITE \nCONDITIONS \n\nFatigue \nPyrexia \nChills \nMalaise \nInfluenza-like illness \nChest discomfort \nInjection Site Reactions \n• Injection site pain \n• Injection site induration \n• Injection site eyrthema \n• Injection site swelling \n• Injection site hemorrhage \n• Injection site irritation \n• Injection site pruritus \n• Injection site movement impairment \n\nVery Common \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n \nVery Common \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \nUncommon \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nInfants, children and adolescents: \n \n\nAdverse Reactions (Infants, Children and Adolescents) \nSystem Organ Class  \n\n(SOC) \nPreferred MedDRA \n\nTerm \nFrequency  \n\n6 – 35 months 3 – 8 years 9 – 17 years \nINFECTIONS AND \nINFESTATIONS \n\nNasopharyngitis Common Common Common  \n\nMETABOLISM AND \nNUTRITION DISORDERS \n\nDecreased appetite Common Uncommon Uncommon \n\nPSYCHIATRIC \nDISORDERS \n\nInsomnia \nSleep disorder \n\n- \nCommon  \n\n- \n- \n\nUncommon \n- \n\nNERVOUS SYSTEM \nDISORDERS \n\nDizziness \nHeadache \nCrying \nSomnolence \nHypoaesthesia \n\n- \n- \nCommon  \nVery Common \n- \n\n- \nCommon  \n- \n- \n- \n\nUncommon \nVery Common  \n- \n- \nUncommon \n\nEYE DISORDERS Eye irritation -

Neurological disorders, such as \nencephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01 \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER has been authorised under ‘exceptional \ncircumstances’. This means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete \ninformation on this medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will review any new \ninformation which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccine following a two-dose \nadministration. \n \nMock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating \ninfluenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as ‘novel’ antigens and simulate a situation where \nthe target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data obtained with the mock-up \nvaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical \nimmunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the \npandemic vaccines. \n \nAdults, older people and special risk groups \n \nImmune response against the vaccine strain contained in PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE \nH5N1 BAXTER (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) \n \nThe immunogenicity of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER (strain \nA/Vietnam/1203/2004) has been evaluated in three clinical studies in adults aged 18 – 59 years \n(N=961) and in older subjects aged 60 years and older (N=391) following a 0, 21 day schedule. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.dochttp:/www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nIn addition, the immunogenicity has also been evaluated in a Phase 3 study in specified risk groups \nof immunocompromised subjects (N=122) and patients with chronic disease conditions (N=123) \nfollowing a 0, 21 day schedule. \n \nImmunogenicity in adults aged 18 to 59 years (N=961) and in subjects aged 60 years and \nolder (N=391) \n \nAfter primary vaccination the seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for \nanti-HA antibody as measured by single radial haemolysis (SRH) in adults aged 18 to 59 years and in \nolder subjects aged 60 years and above were as follows: \n \n\nSRH Assay 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \n 21 Days After 21 Days After \n 1st Dose 2nd Dose 1st Dose 2nd Dose \nSeroprotection rate* 53.2%  66.8% 47.7% 59.0% \nSeroconversion rate** 39.8% 53.7% 41.9% 52.2% \nSeroconversion factor*** 2.5 3.4 2.7 3.5 \n* SRH area ≥ 25 mm² \n** either SRH area ≥ 25 mm2 if baseline sample negative or 50% increase in SRH area if baseline \n\nsample > 4 mm² \n*** geometric mean increase \n \nAfter primary vaccination the rate of subjects with neutralising antibody titres ≥ 20, seroconversion \nrate and seroconversion factor as measured by microneutralisation assay (MN) in adults \naged 18 to 59 years and in older subjects aged 60 years and above were as follows: \n \n\nMicroneutralisation assay 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \n 21 Days After 21 Days After \n 1st Dose 2nd Dose 1st Dose 2nd Dose \n\nSeroneutralisation rate* 44.4% 69.7% 51.9% 69.2% \nSeroconversion rate** 32.7% 56.0% 13.3% 23.9% \nSeroconversion factor*** 3.0 4.5 2.0 2.6 \n* MN titre ≥ 20 \n** ≥ 4-fold increase in MN titre \n*** geometric mean increase \n \nImmunogenicity in immunocompromised subjects (N=122) and in patients with chronic disease \nconditions (N=123) \n \nAfter vaccination the rate of subjects with neutralising antibody titres ≥ 20, seroconversion rate and \nseroconversion factor as measured by MN assay in immunocompromised subjects and patients with \nchronic disease conditions were as follows: \n \n\nMicroneutralisation Assay Immunocompromised subjects Patients with chronic disease conditions \n 21 Days After 21 Days After \n 1st Dose  2nd Dose 1st Dose 2nd Dose \n\nSeroneutralisation rate* 24.8% 41.5% 44.3% 64.2% \nSeroconversion rate** 9.1% 32.2% 17.2% 35.0% \nSeroconversion factor*** 1.6 2.5 2.3 3.0 \n* MN titre ≥ 20 \n** ≥ 4-fold increase in MN titre \n*** geometric mean increase \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nAntibody persistence \nAntibody persistence after vaccination with the 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted formulation of \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER (strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004) has been \nevaluated in a clinical study in adults aged 18 – 59 years and subjects aged 60 years and above \nat 6 months, 12 - 15 months and 24 months after the start of the primary vaccination series. \nThe results indicate an overall decline in antibody levels over time. \n \n\nSeroprotection*/ 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \nSeroneutralisation rate** SRH Assay MN Assay SRH Assay MN Assay \n\nMonth 6 23.9% 35.0% 26.7% 40.5% \nMonth 12-15 20.7% 34.2% 18.9% 36.2% \nMonth 24 22.4% 18.4% 12.3% 22.8% \n* SRH area ≥ 25 mm² \n** MN titre ≥ 20 \n \nCross-reactive immune response against related H5N1 strains \nIn a phase 3 study in adults (N=270) and older subjects (N=272) after vaccination with the \nA/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain vaccine the rate of subjects with cross-neutralising antibodies as \nmeasured by MN (titre ≥ 20) was as follows: \n \n 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \n Day 42 a Day 180 Day 42 a Day 180 \n\nTested against Strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 \nSeroneutralisation rate* 35.1% 14.4% 54.8% 28.0% \n* MN titre ≥ 20 \na 21 days after 2nd dose \n \nHeterologous booster vaccinations \nA booster vaccination with a 7.5 µg heterologous A/Indonesia/05/2005 vaccine strain has been \nadministered in a time window of 12 to 24 months after priming vaccination with two doses of the \nA/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain vaccine in three clinical studies in adults aged 18 to 59 years and in older \npeople aged 60 years and above.

Two studies have been \nperformed using either the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 or the A/Indonesia/05/2005 vaccine. \n \nIn one study, sixteen ferrets were divided into two cohorts and were vaccinated on \ndays 0 and 21 with 7.5 µg of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine or were sham vaccinated. \nAll ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of the highly virulent \nH5N1 virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. Ferrets vaccinated with \nthe 7.5 µg dose of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine demonstrated a high rate of seroconversion. \nThe A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine afforded protection against homologous challenge as evidenced \nby full survivorship, reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, \na less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of inflammation and necrosis in brain \nand olfactory bulb in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to control animals. All control animals \nsuccumbed to the infection. \n \nIn a second study, sixty-six ferrets were divided into 6 cohorts of 11 ferrets and were immunized on \ndays 0 and 21 with 3.75 µg or 7.5 µg of the Indonesia vaccine or were sham vaccinated. The ferrets \nwere challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of either the clade 2 H5N1 virus \nA/Indonesia/05/2005 or the clade 1 H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. \nThe A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine was shown to be efficacious with 100% survival, reduced incidence \nof fever, reduced weight loss, reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological (leukopenia and \nlymphopenia) changes in the vaccinated cohorts following homologous challenge. Similarly, the \nA/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine was efficacious against a heterologous challenge, showing a vaccine \ndose-dependent survivorship in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to the control cohort. Similar to \nthe homologous challenge, vaccination against a heterologous challenge reduced virus burden, and \nreduced haematological (leukopenia) changes associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza \ninfection. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical studies demonstrated minor alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels in a repeat \ndose toxicity study in rats. Clinically significant alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels have \nnot been seen to date in human clinical studies. \n \nAnimal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful \neffects with respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development parturition or post \nnatal development. Male fertility was not investigated in the reproductive and developmental toxicity \nstudies, however there were no findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies to indicate any \nvaccine-related changes to the tissues of the male reproductive tract. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nThe vaccine is an off-white, opalescent, translucent suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. Pandemic influenza vaccine \nshould be used in accordance with official guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdults and children from 6 months onwards: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \n \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunization should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral \nthigh, depending on the muscle mass. \n \nFor further information, see section 5.1. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to the active substance, to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1 or to trace residues (e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) of this \nvaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that \nfacilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nSee section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\n• Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following use of \na similar whole virion, Vero cell derived H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during \na pandemic period. Such reactions occurred both in patients with a history of multiple \nallergies and in patients with no known allergy. \n\n \n• Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known \n\nhypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any \nof the excipients and to trace residues e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, or sucrose. \n\n \n• As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should \n\nalways be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the \nadministration of the vaccine. \n\n \n• If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe \n\nfebrile illness or acute infection. \n \n• PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should under no circumstances \n\nbe administered intravascularly. \n \n• There are no data with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER using \n\nthe subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and \npotential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any \nbleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential \nbenefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n\n \n• Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be \n\ninsufficient. \n \n• A protective response may not be induced in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n\n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n• PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should not be given at the same \ntime as other vaccines. However, if co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, \nimmunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse \nreactions may be intensified. \n\n \n• Immunoglobulin is not to be given with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE \n\nH5N1 BAXTER. If it is necessary to provide immediate protection, PANDEMIC \nINFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be given at the same time as normal or \nspecific immunoglobulin. Injections of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE \nH5N1 BAXTER and immunoglobulin should be made into separate limbs. \n\n \n• The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing \n\nimmunosuppressant treatment. \n \n• Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA \n\nmethod to detect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been \nobserved. The Western Blot technique disproves the results. The transient false positive \nreactions could be due to the IgM response by the vaccine. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe safety of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER in pregnancy and lactation has \nnot been assessed in clinical trials. Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated \nnon-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest malformations or foetal or neonatal toxicity. \n \nAnimal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with H5N1 strain vaccines \n(A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects \nwith respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). \n \nThe use of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be considered during \npregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into account official recommendations. \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may be used in lactating women. \n \nHealth care providers should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific \npatient before administering PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 such as dizziness and vertigo may affect the \nability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nAdults, older people and special risk groups \n \nClinical trials were conducted with this H5N1 vaccine (see section 5.1 for more information on \nthe H5N1 vaccines) in approximately 3500 subjects (ranging in age groups from 18 to 59 years \nand 60 years and above) and special risk groups of approximately 300 subjects each, consisting of \nimmunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions. \n \nThe safety profile in immunocompromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions \nis similar to the safety profile in healthy adults and older people subjects. \n \nInfants, children, and adolescents \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years: \nIn a clinical trial 300 adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 153 children aged 3 to 8 years were \nadministered the H5N1 vaccine.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01 \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER has been authorised under ‘exceptional \ncircumstances’. This means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete \ninformation on this medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will review any new \ninformation which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccine following a two-dose \nadministration. \n \nMock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating \ninfluenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as ‘novel’ antigens and simulate a situation where \nthe target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data obtained with the mock-up \nvaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical \nimmunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the \npandemic vaccines. \n \nAdults, older people and special risk groups \n \nImmune response against the vaccine strain contained in PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE \nH5N1 BAXTER (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) \n \nThe immunogenicity of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER (strain \nA/Vietnam/1203/2004) has been evaluated in three clinical studies in adults aged 18 – 59 years \n(N=961) and in older subjects aged 60 years and older (N=391) following a 0, 21 day schedule. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.dochttp:/www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20 \n\nIn addition, the immunogenicity has also been evaluated in a Phase 3 study in specified risk groups of \nimmunocompromised subjects (N=122) and patients with chronic disease conditions (N=123) \nfollowing a 0, 21 day schedule. \n \nImmunogenicity in adults aged 18 to 59 years (N=961) and in subjects aged 60 years and \nolder (N=391) \n \nAfter primary vaccination the seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for \nanti-HA antibody as measured by single radial haemolysis (SRH) in adults aged 18 to 59 years and in \nolder subjects aged 60 years and above were as follows: \n \n\nSRH Assay 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \n 21 Days After 21 Days After \n 1st Dose 2nd Dose 1st Dose 2nd Dose \nSeroprotection rate* 53.2%  66.8% 47.7% 59.0% \nSeroconversion rate** 39.8% 53.7% 41.9% 52.2% \nSeroconversion factor*** 2.5 3.4 2.7 3.5 \n* SRH area ≥ 25 mm² \n** either SRH area ≥ 25 mm2 if baseline sample negative or 50% increase in SRH area if baseline \n\nsample > 4 mm² \n*** geometric mean increase \n \nAfter primary vaccination the rate of subjects with neutralising antibody titres ≥ 20, seroconversion \nrate and seroconversion factor as measured by microneutralisation assay (MN) in adults \naged 18 to 59 years and in older subjects aged 60 years and above were as follows: \n \n\nMicroneutralisation assay 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \n 21 Days After 21 Days After \n 1st Dose 2nd Dose 1st Dose 2nd Dose \n\nSeroneutralisation rate* 44.4% 69.7% 51.9% 69.2% \nSeroconversion rate** 32.7% 56.0% 13.3% 23.9% \nSeroconversion factor*** 3.0 4.5 2.0 2.6 \n* MN titre ≥ 20 \n** ≥ 4-fold increase in MN titre \n*** geometric mean increase \n \nImmunogenicity in immunocompromised subjects (N=122) and in patients with chronic disease \nconditions (N=123) \n \nAfter vaccination the rate of subjects with neutralising antibody titres ≥ 20, seroconversion rate and \nseroconversion factor as measured by MN assay in immunocompromised subjects and patients with \nchronic disease conditions were as follows: \n \n\nMicroneutralisation Assay Immunocompromised subjects Patients with chronic disease conditions \n 21 Days After 21 Days After \n 1st Dose  2nd Dose 1st Dose 2nd Dose \n\nSeroneutralisation rate* 24.8% 41.5% 44.3% 64.2% \nSeroconversion rate** 9.1% 32.2% 17.2% 35.0% \nSeroconversion factor*** 1.6 2.5 2.3 3.0 \n* MN titre ≥ 20 \n** ≥ 4-fold increase in MN titre \n*** geometric mean increase \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nAntibody persistence \nAntibody persistence after vaccination with the 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted formulation of \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER (strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004) has been \nevaluated in a clinical study in adults aged 18 – 59 years and subjects aged 60 years and above \nat 6 months, 12 - 15 months and 24 months after the start of the primary vaccination series. \nThe results indicate an overall decline in antibody levels over time. \n \n\nSeroprotection*/ 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \nSeroneutralisation rate** SRH Assay MN Assay SRH Assay MN Assay \n\nMonth 6 23.9% 35.0% 26.7% 40.5% \nMonth 12-15 20.7% 34.2% 18.9% 36.2% \nMonth 24 22.4% 18.4% 12.3% 22.8% \n* SRH area ≥ 25 mm² \n** MN titre ≥ 20 \n \nCross-reactive immune response against related H5N1 strains \nIn a phase 3 study in adults (N=270) and older subjects (N=272) after vaccination with the \nA/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain vaccine the rate of subjects with cross-neutralising antibodies as \nmeasured by MN (titre ≥ 20) was as follows: \n \n 18 – 59 years 60 years and above \n Day 42 a Day 180 Day 42 a Day 180 \n\nTested against Strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 \nSeroneutralisation rate* 35.1% 14.4% 54.8% 28.0% \n* MN titre ≥ 20 \na 21 days after 2nd dose \n \nHeterologous booster vaccinations \nA booster vaccination with a 7.5 µg heterologous A/Indonesia/05/2005 vaccine strain has been \nadministered in a time window of 12 to 24 months after priming vaccination with two doses of the \nA/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain vaccine in three clinical studies in adults aged 18 to 59 years and in older \naged 60 years and above.

Two studies have \nbeen performed using either the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 or the A/Indonesia/05/2005 vaccine. \n \nIn one study, sixteen ferrets were divided into two cohorts and were vaccinated on \ndays 0 and 21 with 7.5 µg of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine or were sham vaccinated. \nAll ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of the highly virulent \nH5N1 virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. Ferrets vaccinated with \nthe 7.5 µg dose of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine demonstrated a high rate of seroconversion. \nThe A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine afforded protection against homologous challenge as evidenced \nby full survivorship, reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, \na less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of inflammation and necrosis in brain \nand olfactory bulb in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to control animals. All control animals \nsuccumbed to the infection. \n \nIn a second study, sixty-six ferrets were divided into 6 cohorts of 11 ferrets and were immunized on \ndays 0 and 21 with 3.75 µg or 7.5 µg of the Indonesia vaccine or were sham vaccinated. The ferrets \nwere challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of either the clade 2 H5N1 virus \nA/Indonesia/05/2005 or the clade 1 H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and monitored for 14 days. \nThe A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine was shown to be efficacious with 100% survival, reduced incidence \nof fever, reduced weight loss, reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological (leukopenia and \nlymphopenia) changes in the vaccinated cohorts following homologous challenge. Similarly, the \nA/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine was efficacious against a heterologous challenge, showing a vaccine \ndose-dependent survivorship in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to the control cohort. Similar to \nthe homologous challenge, vaccination against a heterologous challenge reduced virus burden, and \nreduced haematological (leukopenia) changes associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza \ninfection. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical studies demonstrated minor alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels in a repeat \ndose toxicity study in rats. Clinically significant alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels have \nnot been seen to date in human clinical studies. \n \nAnimal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful \neffects with respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development parturition or post \nnatal development. Male fertility was not investigated in the reproductive and developmental toxicity \nstudies, however there were no findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies to indicate any \nvaccine-related changes to the tissues of the male reproductive tract. \n \n \n6.

This should include data from ongoing studies, or actual use if applicable, \nof the ‘mock-up’ strains. \n \nDuring a pandemic situation, the resources must be concentrated on a timely and effective monitoring \nof the safety profile of the influenza vaccines used during the pandemic. Moreover, a 6-monthly cycle \nmay be too long to allow assessment of the safety of a vaccine for which high levels of exposure are \nexpected within a short period of time. Therefore, 6-monthly or annual PSURs falling within the \npandemic period will be replaced by monthly “simplified PSURs” (S-PSUR) accompanied by \na summary of vaccine distribution. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nFrequency of submission \n \n- The clock should start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine. \n- First data-lock point is 30 days later. \n- S-PSUR submission to the Rapporteur and CHMP members on Day 45. \n- Rapporteur’s assessment report is circulated to CHMP members on Day 50. \n- CHMP report is circulated to the vaccine manufacturer on Day 55. \n- Reporting to be monthly for the first 6 months. \n- Periodicity should be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 6 monthly intervals. \n \nWhen it has been agreed by the CHMP that the S-PSUR is no longer necessary, a full PSUR covering \nthe period since the data lock point of the last routine PSUR will be submitted within a time frame to \nbe agreed with the Rapporteur. \n \nFormat of the simplified PSUR \n \nOnly spontaneously reported data should be included in the S-PSUR. The report should include the \nfollowing Tables of aggregate data (using the pre-defined templates attached in Annex 2). \n \n\n1. An overview for all spontaneous cases per country, stratified according to type of report \n(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed) and seriousness, for the period \ncovered by the report and cumulatively. \n\n \n2. An overview for all spontaneous adverse reactions by SOC, High Level Term (HLT) \n\nand Preferred Term (PT), stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed \nor non-medically confirmed) and including the number of fatal reports, for the period \ncovered by the report and cumulatively. \n\n \n3. Adverse Events of Special Interest stratified according to type of report (medically \n\nconfirmed or non-medically confirmed). AESIs will be defined as follows: \n \n\n- Neuritis: PT “Neuritis” \n- Convulsion: narrow SMQ “Convulsions” \n- Anaphylaxis: narrow SMQ “Anaphylactic reaction”\n\n and narrow SMQ “Angioedema” \n- Encephalitis: narrow SMQ “Non-infectious\n\n encephalitis” \n- Vasculitis: narrow SMQ “Vasculitis” \n- Guillain-Barré syndrome: narrow SMQ “Guillain-Barré\n\n syndrome” \n- Demyelination: narrow SMQ “Demyelination”  \n\n (as GBS is also included in this SMQ,\n there will be an overlap in the number\n of cases for these two categories). \n\n- Bell’s palsy: PT “Bell’s palsy” \n- Vaccination failure: PT “Vaccination failure”. \n\n \n4. Serious unlisted adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PTs) stratified according to type of report \n\n(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered by the report \nand cumulatively. \n\n \n5. All spontaneous adverse reactions by age group, per SOC, HLT and PT, stratified \n\naccording to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the \nperiod covered by the report and cumulatively. The following age groups will be used: \n< 2 years, 2-8 years, ≥ 9 years. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n6. All spontaneous adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PT) occurring in pregnant women, \nstratified according to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), \nfor the period covered by the report and cumulatively. \n\n \nThe following principles should be followed when compiling the data: \n \n- Except for Table 1, all tables will be based on number of reactions (presented on PT level, \n\nsorted by System Organ Class [SOC] and High Level Term [HLT]) and not number of cases. \n- All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data1. Product-specific data can be \n\nevaluated during signal work-up. \n- “Cumulatively” means since the use of the vaccine; events not reported during the period of \n\ninterest should not be presented in the tables. \n- All non-medically confirmed events are those that have been entered into the database by the \n\ndata-lock point. Those which have not yet been entered should be reported in the following \nS-PSUR. \n\n- A line listing of fatal cases will be provided in an Annex. \n \nA short summary should be provided in which validated signals and areas of concern are highlighted, \ntaking into account information arising from the prospective cohort study described in 4.5. In the event \nof multiple signals, signal work-up may be prioritised and appropriate timelines for submission of a \nfull signal evaluation report should be provided. \n \nVaccine distribution report \n \nTo put the safety report into context, a summary of vaccine distribution should be included and should \nprovide details of the number of doses of vaccine distributed in \n\ni) EU member states for the reporting period by batch number, \nii) EU member states cumulatively and \niii) the rest of the world. \n\n \n \nD.

What you need to know before you are vaccinated with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE \n\nH5N1 BAXTER \n3. How PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER is and what it is used for \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER is a vaccine used in individuals \naged 6 months adults and older. It is used to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly to affect \nmost countries and regions around the world. The symptoms (signs) of pandemic flu are similar to \nthose of an ‘ordinary’ flu but are usually more severe. \n \nThe vaccine works by helping the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your are vaccinated with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA \n\nVACCINE H5N1 BAXTER \n \nDo not use PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER \n \n• if you previously had a serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to PANDEMIC \n\nINFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. \n• if you are allergic to any of the ingredients or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) \n\ncontained in the vaccine. The active substance and other ingredients in PANDEMIC \nINFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER are listed in section 6 at the end of the leaflet. Signs \nof an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face \nor tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, your doctor may recommend to give the vaccine. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions: \n \nYou should tell your doctor before vaccination \n• if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \n\nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor should advise whether you could still be \nvaccinated with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER; \n\n\n\n41 \n\n• if you have had any allergic reaction, to any ingredient contained in the vaccine (see section 6 at \nthe end of the leaflet) or to formaldehyde, benzonase or sucrose. Allergic reactions, including \nsudden and life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), have been reported with a similar \nH1N1 influenza vaccine (swine flu vaccine) given during a pandemic period. Such reactions \nhave happened both in people who have allergies and in those who do not; \n\n• if you have a poor immune response (for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, \ne.g. corticosteroid treatments or chemotherapy for cancer); \n\n• if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER the \nresults of these tests may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have \nrecently received PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER; \n\n• if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel. \nThere is no information on the use of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER under \nthe skin. \n \nOther medicines and PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should not be given at the same time as other \nvaccines. However, if this cannot be avoided, the other vaccine should be injected into the other limb. \nYou should be aware that the side effects may be intensified. \n \nIf you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment \n(such as radiotherapy) that affects the immune system, PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE \nH5N1 BAXTER can still be given but your response to the vaccine may be poor. \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should not be given at the same time as \nimmunoglobulins. However, if this cannot be avoided, the immunoglobulins should be injected into \nthe other limb. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf your are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice if you should receive PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may make you feel dizzy or sick which may \naffect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER \n \nInfants, children and adolescents from the age of 6 months to 17 years and adults from the age \nof 18 years and older: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml will be given. A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least \nthree weeks. \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER is given as an injection into the muscle \n(usually in the upper arm or upper thigh, depending on the muscle mass). \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a vein. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER can cause side effects, \nalthough not everybody gets them. \n \nIn the clinical studies conducted in adults and older people with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA \nVACCINE H5N1 BAXTER, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. The side-effects are \ngenerally similar to those related to the influenza vaccine. There were fewer side effects after the \nsecond vaccination compared with the first.

What PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER is and what it is used for \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER is a vaccine used in individuals \naged 6 months and older. It is used to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly to affect \nmost countries and regions around the world. The symptoms (signs) of pandemic flu are similar to \nthose of an ‘ordinary’ flu but are usually more severe. \n \nThe vaccine works by helping the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are vaccinated with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA \n\nVACCINE H5N1 BAXTER \n \nDo not use PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER \n \n• if you previously had a serious allergic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to PANDEMIC \n\nINFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. \n• if you are allergic to any of the ingredients or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) \n\ncontained in the vaccine. The active substance and other ingredients in PANDEMIC \nINFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER are listed in section 6 at the end of the leaflet. Signs \nof an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face \nor tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, your doctor may recommend to give the vaccine. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions: \n \nYou should tell your doctor before vaccination \n• if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \n\nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor should advise whether you could still be \nvaccinated with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER; \n\n\n\n48 \n\n• if you have had any allergic reaction, to any ingredient contained in the vaccine (see section 6 at \nthe end of the leaflet) or to formaldehyde, benzonase or sucrose. Allergic reactions, including \nsudden and life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), have been reported with a similar \nH1N1 influenza vaccine (swine flu vaccine) given during a pandemic period. Such reactions \nhave happened both in people who have allergies and in those who do not; \n\n• if you have a poor immune response (for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, \ne.g. corticosteroid treatments or chemotherapy for cancer); \n\n• if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER the \nresults of these tests may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have \nrecently received PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER; \n\n• if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a blood vessel. \nThere is no information on the use of PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER under \nthe skin. \n \nOther medicines and PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should not be given at the same time as other \nvaccines. However, if this cannot be avoided, the other vaccine should be injected into the other limb. \nYou should be aware that the side effects may be intensified. \n \nIf you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment (such \nas radiotherapy) that affects the immune system, PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE \nH5N1 BAXTER can still be given but your response to the vaccine may be poor. \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER should not be given at the same time as \nimmunoglobulins. However, if this cannot be avoided, the immunoglobulins should be injected into \nthe other limb. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf your are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice if you should receive PANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE H5N1 BAXTER may make you feel dizzy or sick which may \naffect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3.
