PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nProlonged release suspension for injection.\nThe suspension is white to off-white. The suspension is pH neutral (approximately 7.0).\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTREVICTA, a 3-monthly injection, is indicated for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in \nadult patients who are clinically stable on 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable product (see\nsection 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPatients who are adequately treated with 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable (preferably for \nfour months or more) and do not require dose adjustment may be switched to 3-monthly paliperidone\npalmitate injection.\n\nTREVICTA should be initiated in place of the next scheduled dose of 1-monthly paliperidone \npalmitate injectable (\u00b1 7 days). The TREVICTA dose should be based on the previous 1-monthly\npaliperidone palmitate injectable dose using a 3.5-fold higher dose shown in the following table:\n\n\n\n3\n\nTREVICTA doses for patients adequately treated with 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate \ninjectable\n\nIf the last dose of 1-monthly paliperidone \npalmitate injectable is\n\nInitiate TREVICTA at the following dose\n\n50 mg 175 mg\n75 mg 263 mg\n100 mg 350 mg\n150 mg 525 mg\n\nThere is no equivalent dose of TREVICTA for the 25 mg dose of 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate \ninjectable which was not studied.\n\nFollowing the initial TREVICTA dose, TREVICTA should be administered by intramuscular injection \nonce every 3 months (\u00b1 2 weeks, see also Missed dose section).\n\nIf needed, dose adjustment of TREVICTA can be made every 3 months in increments within the range \nof 175 mg to 525 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy. Due to the long-acting \nnature of TREVICTA, the patient\u2019s response to an adjusted dose may not be apparent for several \nmonths (see section 5.2). If the patient remains symptomatic, they should be managed according to \nclinical practice.\n\nSwitching from other antipsychotic medicinal products\nPatients should not be switched directly from other antipsychotics as 3-monthly paliperidone palmitate \ninjectable should only be initiated after the patient is stabilised on the 1-monthly paliperidone \npalmitate injectable.\n\nSwitching from TREVICTA to other antipsychotic medicinal products\nIf TREVICTA is discontinued, its prolonged release characteristics must be considered.\n\nSwitching from TREVICTA to 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable\nFor switching from TREVICTA to 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable, 1-monthly\npaliperidone palmitate injectable should be administered at the time the next TREVICTA dose was to \nbe administered using a 3.5-fold lower dose shown in the following table. The initiation dosing as \ndescribed in the prescribing information for 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable is not \nrequired. The 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable should then continue to be dosed at monthly \nintervals as described within its prescribing information.\n\nDoses of 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable for patients switching from TREVICTA\nIf the last dose of TREVICTA is Initiate 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate \n\ninjectable 3 months later at the following dose\n175 mg 50 mg\n263 mg 75 mg\n350 mg 100 mg\n525 mg 150 mg\n\nSwitching from TREVICTA to oral daily paliperidone prolonged release tablets\nFor switching from TREVICTA to paliperidone prolonged release tablets, the daily dosing of \npaliperidone prolonged release tablets should be started 3 months after the last TREVICTA dose and \ntreatment continued with paliperidone prolonged release tablets as described in the table below. The \nfollowing table provides recommended dose conversion regimens to allow patients previously \nstabilised on different doses of TREVICTA to attain similar paliperidone exposure with paliperidone \nprolonged release tablets.\n\n\n\n4\n\nDoses of paliperidone prolonged release tablets for patients switching from TREVICTA*\n\nLast TREVICTA dose\n(Week 0)\n\nWeek number after last TREVICTA dose\nWeek 12 to Week 18, \n\ninclusive\nWeek 19 to Week 24, \n\ninclusive\nFrom Week 25\n\nonwards\nDaily dose of paliperidone prolonged release tablets\n\n175 mg 3 mg 3 mg 3 mg\n263 mg 3 mg 3 mg 6 mg\n350 mg 3 mg 6 mg 9 mg\n525 mg 6 mg 9 mg 12 mg\n\n* All doses of once daily paliperidone prolonged release tablets should be individualised to the specific patient, taking \ninto consideration variables such as reasons for switching, response to previous paliperidone treatment, severity of \npsychotic symptoms, and/or propensity for side effects.\n\nMissed dose\n\nDosing window\nTREVICTA should be injected once every 3 months. To avoid a missed dose of TREVICTA patients \nmay be given the injection up to 2 weeks before or after the 3-month time point.\n\nMissed doses\nIf scheduled dose is missed and the time since \n\nlast injection is\nAction\n\n> 3\u00bd months up to 4 months The injection should be administered as soon as \npossible and then resume the 3-monthly\ninjection schedule.\n\n4 months to 9 months Use the recommended re-initiation regimen \nshown in the table below.\n\n> 9 months Re-initiate treatment with 1-monthly\npaliperidone palmitate injectable as described in \nthe prescribing information for that product. \nTREVICTA can then be resumed after the \npatient has been adequately treated with \n1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable \npreferably for four months or more.\n\nRecommended re-initiation regimen after missing 4 months to 9 months of TREVICTA\n\nIf the last dose of \nTREVICTA was\n\nAdminister 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate \ninjectable, two doses one week apart (into \n\ndeltoid muscle)\n\nThen administer \nTREVICTA (into \ndeltoida or gluteal \n\nmuscle)\nDay 1 Day 8 1 month after day 8\n\n175 mg 50 mg 50 mg 175 mg\n263 mg 75 mg 75 mg 263 mg\n350 mg 100 mg 100 mg 350 mg\n525 mg 100 mg 100 mg 525 mg\n\na\nSee also Information intended for medical or healthcare professionals for deltoid injection needle selection based on \nbody weight.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nEfficacy and safety in elderly > 65 years have not been established.\n\nIn general, recommended dosing of TREVICTA for elderly patients with normal renal function is the \nsame as for younger adult patients with normal renal function. As elderly patients may have reduced \nrenal function, see Renal impairment below for dosing recommendations in patients with renal \nimpairment.\n\n\n\n5\n\nRenal impairment\nTREVICTA has not been studied in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). For patients with\nmild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 50 to < 80 mL/min), dose should be adjusted and the \npatient stabilised using 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable, and then transitioned to \nTREVICTA.\n\nTREVICTA is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 50 mL/min).\n\nHepatic impairment\nTREVICTA has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Based on experience with oral \npaliperidone, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. As \npaliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, caution is recommended \nin such patients (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of TREVICTA in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTREVICTA is intended for intramuscular use only. It must not be administered by any other route. \nEach injection must be administered only by a health care professional giving the full dose in a single \ninjection. It should be injected slowly, deep into the deltoid or gluteal muscle. A switch from gluteal to \ndeltoid (and vice versa) should be considered for future injection in the event of injection site \ndiscomfort (see section 4.8).\n\nTREVICTA must be administered using only the thin wall needles that are provided in the \nTREVICTA pack. Needles from the 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable pack or other \ncommercially available needles must not be used when administering TREVICTA (see Information \nintended for medical or health care professionals).\n\nThe contents of the pre-filled syringe should be inspected visually for foreign matter and \ndiscolouration prior to administration. It is important to shake the syringe vigorously with the tip \nup and a loose wrist for at least 15 seconds to ensure a homogeneous suspension. TREVICTA \nshould be administered within 5 minutes after shaking. If more than 5 minutes pass before \ninjection, shake vigorously again for at least 15 seconds to re-suspend the medicinal product. (See \nInformation intended for medical or health care professionals).\n\nDeltoid muscle administration\nThe specified needle for administration of TREVICTA into the deltoid muscle is determined by the \npatient\u2019s weight.\n\uf0b7 For those \u2265 90 kg, the thin wall 1\u00bd inch, 22 gauge (0.72 mm x 38.1 mm) needle should be used.\n\uf0b7 For those < 90 kg, the thin wall 1 inch, 22 gauge (0.72 mm x 25.4 mm) needle should be used.\n\nIt should be administered into the centre of the deltoid muscle. Deltoid injections should be alternated \nbetween the two deltoid muscles.\n\nGluteal muscle administration\nThe needle to be used for administration of TREVICTA into the gluteal muscle is the thin wall \n1\u00bd inch, 22 gauge (0.72 mm x 38.1 mm) needle regardless of body weight. It should be administered\ninto the upper-outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle. Gluteal injections should be alternated between \nthe two gluteal muscles.\n\n\n\n6\n\nIncomplete administration\nTo avoid incomplete administration of TREVICTA, the pre-filled syringe must be shaken vigorously \nfor at least 15 seconds within 5 minutes prior to administration to ensure a homogeneous suspension \n(see Information intended for medical or health care professionals).\n\nHowever, in the event of an incompletely injected dose, the dose remaining in the syringe should not \nbe re-injected and another dose should not be given since it is difficult to estimate the proportion of the \ndose actually administered. The patient should be closely monitored and managed as clinically \nappropriate until the next scheduled 3-monthly injection of TREVICTA.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to risperidone or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nUse in patients who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state\n\nTREVICTA should not be used to manage acutely agitated or severely psychotic states when \nimmediate symptom control is warranted.\n\nQT interval\n\nCaution should be exercised when paliperidone is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular \ndisease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other medicinal products \nthought to prolong the QT interval.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \ninstability, altered consciousness, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels has been reported \nto occur with paliperidone. Additional clinical signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and\nacute renal failure. If a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS, paliperidone should be \ndiscontinued. Consideration should be given to the long-acting nature of TREVICTA.\n\nTardive dyskinesia/extrapyramidal symptoms\n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical, involuntary movements, predominantly of \nthe tongue and/or face. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all \nantipsychotics, including paliperidone, should be considered. Consideration should be given to the \nlong-acting nature of TREVICTA.\n\nCaution is warranted in patients receiving both, psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and \npaliperidone concomitantly, as extrapyramidal symptoms could emerge when adjusting one or both \nmedicinal products. Gradual withdrawal of stimulant treatment is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nLeucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis\n\nEvents of leucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported with paliperidone. Patients \nwith a history of a clinically significant low white blood cell count (WBC) or a drug-induced \nleucopenia/neutropenia should be monitored during the first few months of therapy and \ndiscontinuation of TREVICTA should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline \nin WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia \nshould be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if \nsuch symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \n\n\n\n7\n\n< 1 x 109/L) should discontinue TREVICTA and have their WBC followed until recovery. \nConsideration should be given to the long-acting nature of TREVICTA.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nHypersensitivity reactions can occur even in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or \noral paliperidone (see section 4.8).\n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus\n\nHyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes, including diabetic coma \nand ketoacidosis, have been reported with paliperidone. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in \naccordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines. Patients treated with TREVICTA should be \nmonitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness) \nand patients with diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.\n\nWeight gain\n\nSignificant weight gain has been reported with TREVICTA use. Weight should be monitored \nregularly.\n\nUse in patients with prolactin-dependent tumours\n\nTissue culture studies suggest that cell growth in human breast tumours may be stimulated by \nprolactin. Although no clear association with the administration of antipsychotics has so far been \ndemonstrated in clinical and epidemiological studies, caution is recommended in patients with relevant \nmedical history. Paliperidone should be used with caution in patients with a pre-existing tumour that \nmay be prolactin-dependent.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension\n\nPaliperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension in some patients based on its alpha-adrenergic \nblocking activity. In the clinical trials of TREVICTA, 0.3% of subjects reported orthostatic \nhypotension related adverse reaction. TREVICTA should be used with caution in patients with known \ncardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction or ischaemia, conduction \nabnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g., \ndehydration and hypovolemia).\n\nSeizures\n\nTREVICTA should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that \npotentially lower the seizure threshold.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe plasma concentrations of paliperidone are increased in patients with renal impairment. For \npatients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min), dose should \nbe adjusted and the patient stabilised using 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable, then \ntransitioned to TREVICTA. TREVICTA is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min). (See sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Caution is \nrecommended if paliperidone is used in such patients.\n\n\n\n8\n\nElderly patients with dementia\n\nTREVICTA has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. TREVICTA is not recommended \nto treat elderly patients with dementia due to increased risk of overall mortality and cerebrovascular \nadverse reactions.\n\nThe experience from risperidone cited below is considered valid also for paliperidone.\n\nOverall mortality\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials, elderly patients with dementia treated with other \natypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine had an \nincreased risk of mortality compared to placebo. Among those treated with risperidone, the mortality \nwas 4% compared with 3.1% for placebo.\n\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions\nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions has been seen in \nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \nantipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine. The mechanism for this increased \nrisk is not known.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies\n\nPhysicians should weigh the risks versus the benefits when prescribing TREVICTA to patients with \nParkinson\u2019s disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) since both groups may be at increased risk \nof Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome as well as having an increased sensitivity to antipsychotics. \nManifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with \nfrequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\nPriapism\n\nAntipsychotic medicinal products (including paliperidone) with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects \nhave been reported to induce priapism. Patients should be informed to seek urgent medical care in case \nthat priapism has not been resolved within 4 hours.\n\nBody temperature regulation\n\nDisruption of the body\u2019s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic \nmedicinal products. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing TREVICTA to patients who will be \nexperiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., \nexercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medicinal products with \nanticholinergic activity or being subject to dehydration.\n\nVenous thromboembolism\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. \nSince patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible \nrisk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with TREVICTA and \npreventative measures undertaken.\n\nAntiemetic effect\n\nAn antiemetic effect was observed in preclinical studies with paliperidone. This effect, if it occurs in \nhumans, may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain medicinal products or of \nconditions such as intestinal obstruction, Reye\u2019s syndrome and brain tumour.\n\n\n\n9\n\nAdministration\n\nCare must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of TREVICTA into a blood vessel.\n\nIntraoperative floppy iris syndrome\n\nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in patients \ntreated with medicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect, such as TREVICTA (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nIFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. Current or past use of \nmedicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect should be made known to the \nophthalmic surgeon in advance of surgery. The potential benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocking therapy \nprior to cataract surgery has not been established and must be weighed against the risk of stopping the \nantipsychotic therapy.\n\nExcipients\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \nsodium-free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCaution is advised when prescribing TREVICTA with medicinal products known to prolong the QT\ninterval, e.g., class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide) and class III antiarrhythmics\n(e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), some antihistaminics, some antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolones), some other \nantipsychotics and some antimalarials (e.g., mefloquine). This list is indicative and not exhaustive.\n\nPotential for TREVICTA to affect other medicines\n\nPaliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal \nproducts that are metabolised by cytochrome P450 isozymes.\n\nGiven the primary central nervous system (CNS) effects of paliperidone (see section 4.8), TREVICTA \nshould be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., \nanxiolytics, most antipsychotics, hypnotics, opiates, etc. or alcohol.\n\nPaliperidone may antagonise the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. If this combination \nis deemed necessary, particularly in end-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease, the lowest effective dose of each \ntreatment should be prescribed.\n\nBecause of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.4), an additive effect may \nbe observed when TREVICTA is administered with other medicinal products that have this potential, \ne.g., other antipsychotics, tricyclics.\n\nCaution is advised if paliperidone is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the \nseizure threshold (i.e., phenothiazines or butyrophenones, tricyclics or SSRIs, tramadol, mefloquine, \netc.).\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release tablets at steady-state (12 mg once daily) \nwith divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily) did not affect the \nsteady-state pharmacokinetics of valproate.\n\nNo interaction study between TREVICTA and lithium has been performed, however, a \npharmacokinetic interaction is not likely to occur.\n\n\n\n10\n\nPotential for other medicines to affect TREVICTA\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone \nmetabolism, but there are no indications in vitro nor in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role \nin the metabolism of paliperidone. Concomitant administration of oral paliperidone with paroxetine, a \npotent CYP2D6 inhibitor, showed no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \npaliperidone.\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release once daily with carbamazepine 200 mg twice \ndaily caused a decrease of approximately 37% in the mean steady-state Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. \nThis decrease is caused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of paliperidone \nlikely as a result of induction of renal P-gp by carbamazepine. A minor decrease in the amount of \nactive substance excreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP \nmetabolism or bioavailability of paliperidone during carbamazepine co-administration. Larger \ndecreases in plasma concentrations of paliperidone could occur with higher doses of carbamazepine. \nOn initiation of carbamazepine, the dose of TREVICTA should be re-evaluated and increased if \nnecessary. Conversely, on discontinuation of carbamazepine, the dose of TREVICTA should be \nre-evaluated and decreased if necessary. Consideration should be given to the long-acting nature of \nTREVICTA.\n\nCo-administration of a single dose of an oral paliperidone prolonged release tablet 12 mg with \ndivalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (two 500 mg tablets once daily) resulted in an increase of \napproximately 50% in the Cmax and AUC of paliperidone, likely as a result of increased oral\nabsorption. Since no effect on the systemic clearance was observed, a clinically significant interaction \nwould not be expected between divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets and TREVICTA \nintramuscular injection. This interaction has not been studied with TREVICTA.\n\nConcomitant use of TREVICTA with risperidone or oral paliperidone\n\nSince paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, caution should be exercised when \nTREVICTA is co-administered with risperidone or with oral paliperidone for extended periods of \ntime. Safety data involving concomitant use of TREVICTA with other antipsychotics is limited.\n\nConcomitant use of TREVICTA with psychostimulants\n\nThe combined use of psychostimulants (e.g. methylphenidate) with paliperidone can lead to\nextrapyramidal symptoms upon change of either or both treatments (see section 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of paliperidone during pregnancy. Intramuscularly injected \npaliperidone palmitate and orally administered paliperidone were not teratogenic in animal studies, but \nother types of reproductive toxicity were seen (see section 5.3). Neonates exposed to paliperidone \nduring the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or \nwithdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been \nreports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding \ndisorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored carefully. TREVICTA should not be used \nduring pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nSince paliperidone has been detected in plasma up to 18 months after a single dose of TREVICTA, \nconsideration should be given to the long-acting nature of TREVICTA as maternal exposure to \nTREVICTA before and during pregnancy may lead to adverse reactions in the newborn child.\n\n\n\n11\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nPaliperidone is excreted in the breast milk to such an extent that effects on the breast-fed infant are \nlikely if therapeutic doses are administered to breast-feeding women. Since paliperidone has been \ndetected in plasma up to 18 months after a single dose administration of TREVICTA, consideration \nshould be given to the long-acting nature of TREVICTA as breastfed infants may be at risk even from \nTREVICTA administration long before breast-feeding. TREVICTA should not be used while \nbreast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThere were no relevant effects observed in the non-clinical studies.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPaliperidone can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to \npotential nervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred (see \nsection 4.8). Therefore, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machines until their \nindividual susceptibility to TREVICTA is known.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions reported in \u2265 5% of patients in two double-blind\ncontrolled clinical trials of TREVICTA were weight increased, upper respiratory tract infection, \nanxiety, headache, insomnia, and injection site reaction.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following are all ADRs that were reported with paliperidone by frequency category estimated \nfrom paliperidone palmitate clinical trials. The following terms and frequencies are applied: very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (<

adverse reactions is qualified as \u201cnot known\u201d because they were not observed in paliperidone \npalmitate clinical trials. They were either derived from spontaneous post-marketing reports and frequency cannot be \ndetermined, or they were derived from risperidone (any formulation) or oral paliperidone clinical trials data and/or \npost-marketing reports.\n\nb\nRefer to \u2018Hyperprolactinaemia\u2019 below.\n\nc\nRefer to \u2018Extrapyramidal symptoms\u2019 below.\n\nd\nIn placebo-controlled trials, diabetes mellitus was reported in 0.32% in subjects treated with 1-monthly paliperidone \npalmitate injectable compared to a rate of 0.39% in placebo group. Overall incidence from all clinical trials was 0.65%\nin all subjects treated 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable.\n\ne\nInsomnia includes: initial insomnia, middle insomnia; Convulsion includes: grand mal convulsion; Oedema \nincludes: generalised oedema, oedema peripheral, pitting oedema Menstrual disorder includes: menstruation delayed, \nmenstruation irregular, oligomenorrhoea.\n\nUndesirable effects noted with risperidone formulations\n\nPaliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, therefore, the adverse reaction profiles of these \ncompounds (including both the oral and injectable formulations) are relevant to one another.\n\n\n\n14\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reaction\nRarely, cases of anaphylactic reaction after injection with 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable \nhave been reported during post-marketing experience in patients who have previously tolerated oral \nrisperidone or oral paliperidone (see section 4.4).\n\nInjection site reactions\nIn clinical trials of TREVICTA, 5.3% of subjects reported injection site related adverse reaction. None \nof these events were serious or led to discontinuation. Based on the investigators\u2019 ratings, induration, \nredness, and swelling were absent or mild in \u2265 95% of the assessments. Subject-rated injection site \npain based on a visual analogue scale was low and decreased in intensity over time.\n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)\nIn the clinical trials of TREVICTA, akathisia, dyskinesia, dystonia, parkinsonism, and tremor were \nreported in 3.9%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 3.6%, and 1.4% of subjects, respectively.\n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) included a pooled analysis of the following terms: parkinsonism \n(includes extrapyramidal disorder, extrapyramidal symptoms, on and off phenomenon, Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease, parkinsonian crisis, salivary hypersecretion, musculoskeletal stiffness, parkinsonism, \ndrooling, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, hypokinesia, masked facies, muscle tightness, akinesia, \nnuchal rigidity, muscle rigidity, parkinsonian gait, glabellar reflex abnormal, and parkinsonian rest \ntremor), akathisia (includes akathisia, restlessness, hyperkinesia, and restless leg syndrome), \ndyskinesia (dyskinesia, chorea, movement disorder, muscle twitching, choreoathetosis, athetosis, and \nmyoclonus), dystonia (includes dystonia, cervical spasm, emprosthotonus, oculogyric crisis, \noromandibular dystonia, risus sardonicus, tetany, hypertonia, torticollis, muscle contractions \ninvoluntary, muscle contracture, blepharospasm, oculogyration, tongue paralysis, facial spasm, \nlaryngospasm, myotonia, opisthotonus, oropharyngeal spasm, pleurothotonus, tongue spasm, and \ntrismus), and tremor.\n\nWeight gain\nIn the long-term randomised withdrawal study, abnormal increases of \u2265 7% in body weight from \ndouble-blind baseline to double-blind end point were reported for 10% subjects in the TREVICTA \ngroup and 1% subjects in the placebo group. Conversely, abnormal decreases in body weight (\u2265 7%) \nfrom double-blind baseline to double-blind end point were reported for 1% subjects in the TREVICTA \ngroup and 8% subjects in the placebo group. The mean changes in body weight from double-blind \nbaseline to double-blind end point were +0.94 kg and -1.28 kg for the TREVICTA and placebo\ngroups, respectively.\n\nHyperprolactinaemia\nDuring the double-blind phase of the long-term randomised withdrawal study, elevations of prolactin \nto above the reference range (> 13.13 ng/mL in males and > 26.72 ng/mL in females) were noted in a \nhigher percentage of males and females in the TREVICTA group than in the placebo group (9% vs. \n3% and 5% vs. 1%, respectively). In the TREVICTA group, the mean change from double-blind \nbaseline to double-blind end point was +2.90 ng/mL for males (vs. -10.26 ng/mL in the placebo group) \nand +7.48 ng/mL for females (vs. -32.93 ng/mL in the placebo group). One female (2.4%) in the \nTREVICTA group experienced an adverse reaction of amenorrhea, while no potentially prolactin \nrelated adverse reactions were noted among females in the placebo group. There were no potentially \nprolactin related adverse reactions among males in either group.\n\nClass effects\n\nQT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), sudden \nunexplained death, cardiac arrest, and Torsade de pointes may occur with antipsychotics.\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary embolism and cases of deep vein \nthrombosis, have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products (frequency unknown).\n\n\n\n15\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medical product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn general, expected signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of paliperidone\u2019s \nknown pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, QT \nprolongation, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation have been \nreported in a patient in the setting of overdose with oral paliperidone. In the case of acute overdose, \nthe possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.\n\nManagement\n\nConsideration should be given to the long-acting nature of the medicinal product and the long \nelimination half-life of paliperidone when assessing treatment needs and recovery. There is no specific \nantidote to paliperidone. General supportive measures should be employed. Establish and maintain a \nclear airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.\n\nCardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous \nelectrocardiographic monitoring for possible arrhythmias. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should \nbe treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluid and/or sympathomimetic agents. In \ncase of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic agents should be administered. Close \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics. ATC code: N05AX13\n\nTREVICTA contains a racemic mixture of (+)- and (-)-paliperidone.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nPaliperidone is a selective blocking agent of monoamine effects, whose pharmacological properties \nare different from that of traditional neuroleptics. Paliperidone binds strongly to serotonergic 5-HT2-\nand dopaminergic D2-receptors. Paliperidone also blocks alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and slightly \nless, H1-histaminergic and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and \n(-)-paliperidone enantiomers are qualitatively and quantitatively similar.\n\nPaliperidone is not bound to cholinergic receptors. Even though paliperidone is a strong \nD2-antagonist, which is believed to relieve the symptoms of schizophrenia, it causes less catalepsy and \ndecreases motor functions less than traditional neuroleptics. Dominating central serotonin antagonism \nmay reduce the tendency of paliperidone to cause extrapyramidal side effects.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nThe efficacy of TREVICTA in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in subjects who have been \nadequately treated for at least four months with 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable and the\nlast two doses of the same dosage strength was evaluated in one long-term randomised withdrawal \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16\n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled study and one long-term double-blind, active-controlled, \nnon-inferiority study. For both studies, the primary outcome was based on relapse.\n\nIn the long-term randomised withdrawal study, 506 adult subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for \nschizophrenia were enrolled into the open-label transition phase and treated with flexible doses of \n1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable administered into the deltoid or gluteal muscle \n(50-150 mg) for 17 weeks (dose adjustments occurred at weeks 5 and 9). A total of 379 subjects then \nreceived a single dose of TREVICTA in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle in the open-label \nstabilisation phase (dose was a 3.5 multiple of the last dose of 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate). \nSubjects who were considered clinically stable at the end of the 12-week stabilisation phase were then \nrandomised 1:1 to TREVICTA or placebo in a variable duration double-blind phase (the dose of \nTREVICTA was the same as the last dose received during the stabilisation phase; this dose remained \nfixed throughout the double-blind phase). In this period, 305 symptomatically stable subjects were \nrandomised to continue treatment with TREVICTA (n = 160) or placebo (n = 145) until relapse, early \nwithdrawal, or the end of study. The primary efficacy variable was time to first relapse. The study was \nterminated on the basis of a pre-planned interim analysis conducted when 283 subjects had been \nrandomised and 42 relapse events had been observed.\n\nBased on the final analysis (N = 305), 42 subjects (29.0%) in the placebo group and 14 subjects \n(8.8%) in the TREVICTA group had experienced a relapse event during the double blind phase. The \nhazard ratio was 3.81 (95% CI: 2.08, 6.99) indicating a 74% decrease in relapse risk with TREVICTA \ncompared to placebo. A Kaplan Meier plot of time to relapse by treatment group is shown in Figure 1. \nThere was a significant difference (p < 0.0001) between the two treatment groups in the time to \nrelapse in favour of TREVICTA. The time to relapse of the placebo group (median 395 days) was \nsignificantly shorter than for the TREVICTA group (the median could not be estimated due to the low \npercentage of subjects with relapse [8.8%]).\n\nTime(days) since Randomization\n\n28 56 84 112 140 168 196 224 252 280 308 336 364 392 420 448\n\nE\ns\nti\nm\n\na\nte\n\nd\n P\n\ne\nrc\n\ne\nn\nt \no\n\nf \nS\n\nu\nb\nje\n\nc\nts\n\n W\nit\nh\no\n\nu\nt \nR\n\ne\nla\n\np\ns\ne\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n     Placebo (N=145)\n\nTREVICTA (N=160) logrank test, p-value<0.0001\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier plot of time to relapse \u2013 Final analysis\n\nIn the non-inferiority study, 1,429 acutely ill subjects (baseline mean PANSS total score: 85.7) who \nmet DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were enrolled into the open-label phase and treated with\n1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable for 17 weeks. The dose could be adjusted (i.e., 50 mg, \n75 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg) at the week 5 and 9 injections and the injection site could be deltoid or \ngluteal. For subjects that met randomisation criteria at weeks 14 and 17, 1,016 were randomised in a \n1:1 ratio to continue on monthly injections of 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable or to switch \nto TREVICTA with a 3.5 multiple of the week 9 and 13 dose of 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate \ninjectable for 48 weeks. Subjects received TREVICTA once every 3 months and received \n\n\n\n17\n\nplacebo-injectable medication for the other months to maintain the blind. The primary efficacy \nendpoint of the study was the percentage of subjects who had not relapsed at the end of the 48-week \ndouble-blind phase based on the Kaplan-Meier 48-week estimate (TREVICTA: 91.2%, 1-monthly\npaliperidone palmitate injectable: 90.0%). The median time to relapse in either group could not be \nestimated due to low percentage of subjects with relapse. The difference (95% CI) between the \ntreatment groups was 1.2% (-2.7%, 5.1%), meeting non-inferiority criterion based on a margin of \n-10%. Thus, the TREVICTA treatment group was non-inferior to 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate \ninjectable. Improvements in functioning, as measured by the Personal and Social Performance scale \n(PSP), which was observed during the open-label stabilisation phase were maintained during the \ndouble-blind phase for both treatment groups.\n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier plot of time to relapse comparing TREVICTA and 1-monthly paliperidone \npalmitate injectable\n\nThe efficacy results were consistent across population subgroups (gender, age, and race) in both \nstudies.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTREVICTA in all subsets of the paediatric population in schizophrenia. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption and distribution\n\nDue to its extremely low water solubility, the 3-monthly formulation of paliperidone palmitate \ndissolves slowly after intramuscular injection before being hydrolysed to paliperidone and absorbed \ninto the systemic circulation. The release of the active substance starts as early as day 1 and lasts for as \nlong as 18 months.\n\nThe data presented in this paragraph are based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following a \nsingle intramuscular dose of TREVICTA, the plasma concentrations of paliperidone gradually rise to \nreach maximum plasma concentrations at a median Tmax of 30-33 days. Following intramuscular \ninjection of TREVICTA at doses of 175-525 mg in the deltoid muscle, on average, an 11-12% higher \nCmax was observed compared with injection in the gluteal muscle. The release profile and dosing \nregimen of TREVICTA results in sustained therapeutic concentrations. The total exposure of \npaliperidone following TREVICTA administration was dose-proportional over a 175-525 mg dose \nrange, and approximately dose-proportional for Cmax. The mean steady-state peak:trough ratio for a \nTREVICTA dose was 1.6 following gluteal administration and 1.7 following deltoid administration.\n\n\n\n18\n\nThe plasma protein binding of racemic paliperidone is 74%.\n\nFollowing administration of TREVICTA, the (+) and (-) enantiomers of paliperidone interconvert, \nreaching an AUC (+) to (-) ratio of approximately 1.7-1.8.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\n\nIn a study with oral immediate release 14C-paliperidone, one week following administration of a single \noral dose of 1 mg immediate release 14C-paliperidone, 59% of the dose was excreted unchanged into \nurine, indicating that paliperidone is not extensively metabolised in the liver. Approximately 80% of \nthe administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and 11% in the faeces. Four metabolic pathways \nhave been identified in vivo, none of which accounted for more than 10% of the dose: dealkylation, \nhydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and benzisoxazole scission. Although in vitro studies suggested a \nrole for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of paliperidone, there is no evidence in vivo that \nthese isozymes play a significant role in the metabolism of paliperidone. Population pharmacokinetics \nanalyses indicated no discernible difference on the apparent clearance of paliperidone after \nadministration of oral paliperidone between extensive metabolisers and poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 \nsubstrates. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that paliperidone does not substantially \ninhibit the metabolism of medicines metabolised by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, \nCYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5.\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that paliperidone is a P-gp substrate and a weak inhibitor of P-gp at high \nconcentrations. No in vivo data are available and the clinical relevance is unknown.\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the median apparent half-life of paliperidone following \nTREVICTA administration over the dose range of 175-525 mg ranged from 84-95 days following \ndeltoid injections and 118-139 days following gluteal injections.\n\nLong-acting 3-monthly paliperidone palmitate injection versus other paliperidone formulations\n\nTREVICTA is designed to deliver paliperidone over a 3-month period, while 1-monthly paliperidone \npalmitate injection is administered on a monthly basis. TREVICTA, when administered at doses that \nare 3.5-fold higher than the corresponding dose of 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injection (see \nsection 4.2), results in paliperidone exposures similar to those obtained with corresponding monthly \ndoses of 1-monthly paliperidone palmitate injection and corresponding once daily doses of \npaliperidone prolonged release tablets. The exposure range for TREVICTA is encompassed within the \nexposure range for the approved dose strengths of paliperidone prolonged release tablets.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPaliperidone is not extensively metabolised in the liver. Although TREVICTA was not studied in \npatients with hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate \nhepatic impairment. In a study with oral paliperidone in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh class B), the plasma concentrations of free paliperidone were similar to those of healthy \nsubjects. Paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nTREVICTA has not been systematically studied in patients with renal impairment. The disposition of \na single oral dose of a paliperidone 3 mg prolonged release tablet was studied in subjects with varying \ndegrees of renal function. Elimination of paliperidone decreased with decreasing estimated creatinine \nclearance. Total clearance of paliperidone was reduced in subjects with impaired renal function by \n32% on average in mild (CrCl = 50 to < 80 mL/min), 64% in moderate (CrCl = 30 to < 50 mL/min), \nand 71% in severe (CrCl = 10 to < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, corresponding to an average \nincrease in exposure (AUCinf) of 1.5, 2.6, and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.\n\n\n\n19\n\nElderly\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis showed no evidence of age related pharmacokinetics \ndifferences.\n\nBody mass index (BMI)/body weight\n\nLower Cmax was observed in overweight and obese subjects. At apparent steady-state with \nTREVICTA, the trough concentrations were similar among normal, overweight, and obese subjects.\n\nRace\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis showed no evidence of race related pharmacokinetics \ndifferences.\n\nGender\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis showed no evidence of gender related pharmacokinetics \ndifferences.\n\nSmoking status\n\nBased on in vitro studies utilising human liver enzymes, paliperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone. Effect of \nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone was not studied with TREVICTA. A population \npharmacokinetic analysis based on data with oral paliperidone prolonged release tablets showed a \nslightly lower exposure to paliperidone in smokers compared with non-smokers. The difference is not \nlikely to be of clinical relevance.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeat-dose toxicity studies of intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate (the 1-monthly\nformulation) and orally administered paliperidone in rat and dog showed mainly pharmacological \neffects, such as sedation and prolactin-mediated effects on mammary glands and genitals. In animals \ntreated with paliperidone palmitate an inflammatory reaction was seen at the intramuscular injection \nsite. Occasionally abscess formation occurred.\n\nIn rat reproduction studies with oral risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in rats \nand humans, adverse effects were seen on the birth weight and survival of the offspring. No \nembryotoxicity or malformations were observed following intramuscular administration of \npaliperidone palmitate to pregnant rats up to the highest dose (160 mg/kg/day) corresponding to \n2.2 times the exposure level in humans at the maximum recommended dose of 525 mg. Other \ndopamine antagonists, when administered to pregnant animals, have caused negative effects on \nlearning and motor development in the offspring.\n\nPaliperidone palmitate and paliperidone were not genotoxic. In oral carcinogenicity studies of \nrisperidone in rats and mice, increases in pituitary gland adenomas (mouse), endocrine pancreas \nadenomas (rat), and mammary gland adenomas (both species) were seen. The carcinogenic potential \nof intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate was assessed in rats. There was a statistically \nsignificant increase in mammary gland adenocarcinomas in female rats at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/month. \nMale rats showed a statistically significant increase in mammary gland adenomas and carcinomas at \n30 and 60 mg/kg/month which is 0.6 and 1.2 times the exposure level at the maximum recommended \nhuman 525 mg dose. These tumours can be related to prolonged dopamine D2-antagonism and \nhyperprolactinemia. The relevance of these tumour findings in rodents in terms of human risk is \nunknown.\n\n\n\n20\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What TREVICTA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use TREVICTA\n3. How to use TREVICTA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store TREVICTA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What TREVICTA is and what it is used for\n\nTREVICTA contains the active substance paliperidone which belongs to the class of antipsychotic \nmedicines and is used as a maintenance treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia in adult patients.\n\nIf you have responded well to treatment with paliperidone palmitate injection given once a month, \nyour doctor may start treatment with TREVICTA.\n\nSchizophrenia is a disease with \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d symptoms. Positive means an excess of \nsymptoms that are not normally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may hear voices or \nsee things that are not there (called hallucinations), believe things that are not true (called delusions), \nor feel unusually suspicious of others. Negative means a lack of behaviours or feelings that are \nnormally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may appear withdrawn and may not \nrespond at all emotionally or may have trouble speaking in a clear and logical way. People with this \ndisease may also feel depressed, anxious, guilty, or tense.\n\nTREVICTA can help alleviate the symptoms of your disease and reduce the chance of your symptoms \ncoming back.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use TREVICTA\n\nDo not use TREVICTA\n- if you are allergic to paliperidone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if you are allergic to another antipsychotic medicine including the substance risperidone.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using TREVICTA.\nThis medicine has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. However, elderly patients with \ndementia, who are treated with other similar types of medicine, may have an increased risk of stroke \nor death (see section 4).\n\n\n\n41\n\nAll medicines have side effects and some of the side effects of this medicine can worsen the symptoms \nof other medical conditions. For that reason, it is important to discuss with your doctor any of the \nfollowing conditions which can potentially worsen during treatment with this medicine:\n\n- if you have Parkinson\u2019s disease\n- if you have ever been diagnosed with a condition whose symptoms include high temperature \n\nand muscle stiffness (also known as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome)\n- if you have ever experienced twitching or jerking movements that you cannot control in your \n\nface, tongue, or other parts of your body (Tardive Dyskinesia)\n- if you know that you have had low levels of white blood cells in the past (which may or may not \n\nhave been caused by other medicines)\n- if you are diabetic or prone to diabetes\n- if you have had breast cancer or a tumour in the pituitary gland in your brain\n- if you have a heart disease or heart disease treatment that makes you prone to low blood \n\npressure\n- if you have low blood pressure when you stand up or sit up suddenly\n- if you have a history of seizures\n- if you have kidney problems\n- if you have liver problems\n- if you have prolonged and/or painful erection\n- if you have problems with controlling body temperature or overheating\n- if you have an abnormally high level of the hormone prolactin in your blood or if you have a \n\npossible prolactin-dependent tumour\n- if you or someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as antipsychotics have been \n\nassociated with formation of blood clots.\n\nIf you have any of these conditions, please talk to your doctor as he/she may want to adjust your dose \nor monitor you for a while.\n\nAs dangerously low numbers of a certain type of white blood cell needed to fight infection in your \nblood has been seen very rarely with patients taking this medicine, your doctor may check your white \nblood cell counts.\n\nEven if you have previously tolerated oral paliperidone or risperidone, rarely allergic reactions occur \nafter receiving injections of TREVICTA. Seek medical attention right away if you experience a rash, \nswelling of your throat, itching, or problems breathing as these may be signs of a serious allergic \nreaction.\n\nThis medicine may cause you to gain weight. Significant weight gain may be bad for your health. \nYour doctor should regularly measure your body weight.\n\nAs diabetes mellitus or worsening of pre-existing diabetes mellitus have been seen with patients taking \nthis medicine, your doctor should check for signs of high blood sugar. In patients with pre-existing \ndiabetes mellitus blood glucose should be monitored regularly.\n\nSince this medicine may reduce your urge to vomit, there is a chance that it may mask the body\u2019s \nnormal response to ingestion of toxic substances or other medical conditions.\n\nDuring an operation on the eye for cloudiness of the lens (cataract), the pupil (the black circle in the \nmiddle of your eye) may not increase in size as needed. Also, the iris (the coloured part of the eye) \nmay become floppy during surgery and that may lead to eye damage. If you are planning to have an \noperation on your eye, make sure you tell your eye doctor that you are taking this medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not use this medicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. It is not known if it is safe \nand effective in these patients.\n\n\n\n42\n\nOther medicines and TREVICTA\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nTaking this medicine with carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic and mood stabiliser) may require a change \nto your dose of this medicine.\n\nSince this medicine works primarily in the brain, using other medicines that work in the brain can \ncause an exaggeration of side effects such as sleepiness or other effects on the brain such as other \npsychiatric medications, opioids, antihistamines and sleep medication.\n\nSince this medicine can lower blood pressure, care should be taken when this medicine is used with \nother medicines that lower blood pressure.\n\nThis medicine can reduce the effect of medicines against Parkinson\u2019s disease and restless legs \nsyndrome (e.g., levodopa).\n\nThis medicine may cause an electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality demonstrating a long time for an \nelectrical impulse to travel through a certain part of the heart (known as \u201cQT prolongation\u201d). Other \nmedicines that have this effect include some medicines used to treat the rhythm of the heart or to treat \ninfection, and other antipsychotics.\n\nIf you have a history of seizures, this medicine may increase your chance of experiencing them. Other \nmedicines that have this effect include some medicines used to treat depression or to treat infection, \nand other antipsychotics.\n\nTREVICTA should be used with caution with medicines that increase the activity of the central \nnervous system (psychostimulants such as methylphenidate).\n\nTREVICTA with alcohol\nAlcohol should be avoided.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should not use this medicine \nduring pregnancy unless this has been discussed with your doctor. The following symptoms may occur \nin newborn babies of mothers that have used paliperidone in the last trimester (last three months of \ntheir pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, \nand difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops any of these symptoms seek medical attention for your \nbaby.\n\nThis medicine can pass from mother to baby through breast milk and may harm the baby. Therefore, \nyou should not breast-feed when using this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDizziness, extreme tiredness and vision problems may occur during treatment with this medicine (see \nsection 4). This should be considered in cases where full alertness is required, e.g., when driving a car \nor handling machines.\n\nTREVICTA contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n\n\n43\n\n3.

If you \nhave moderate or severe kidney problems this medicine should not be used.\n\nElderly\nYour doctor will determine your dose of this medicine if your kidney function is reduced.\n\nIf you are given more TREVICTA than needed\nThis medicine will be given to you under medical supervision; it is, therefore, unlikely that you will be \ngiven too much.\n\nPatients who have been given too much paliperidone may experience the following symptoms:\ndrowsiness or sedation, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, an abnormal electrocardiogram (electrical \ntracing of the heart), or slow or abnormal movements of the face, body, arms or legs.\n\nIf you stop using TREVICTA\nIf you stop receiving your injections, your symptoms of schizophrenia may get worse.

Place on a clean surface.\nThen, holding the syringe upright, twist and pull the rubber cap to remove.\n\nGrasp needle pouch\n\nFold back needle cover and plastic tray. Then, firmly grasp the needle sheath through the pouch, as \nshown.\n\n\n\n55\n\nAttach needle\n\nWith your other hand, hold the syringe by the luer connection and attach it to the safety needle with a \ngentle clockwise twisting motion.\nDo not remove the pouch until the syringe and needle are securely attached.\n\nRemove needle sheath\n\nPull the needle sheath away from the needle in a straight motion.\nDo not twist the sheath, as this may loosen the needle from the syringe.\n\nRemove air bubbles\n\nHold the syringe upright and tap gently to make any air bubbles rise to the top.\nSlowly and carefully press plunger rod upward to remove air.\n\n\n\n56\n\nInject dose\n\nSlowly inject the entire contents of the syringe intramuscularly, deep into the selected deltoid or \ngluteal muscle.\nDo not administer by any other route.\n\nSecure needle\n\nAfter the injection is complete, use your thumb or a flat surface to secure the needle in the safety \nmechanism. The needle is secure when a \u201cclick\u201d sound is heard.\n\nInject3\n\nAfter injection4\n\n\n\n57\n\nDispose properly\n\nDispose of the syringe and unused needle in an approved sharps container.\n\nThin wall safety needles are designed specifically for use with \nTREVICTA.

once a month, your doctor may start treatment with trevicta. schizophrenia is a disease with \"positive\" and \"negative\" symptoms. positive means an excess of symptoms that are not normally present. for example, a person with schizophrenia may hear voices or see things that are not there (called hallucinations), believe things that are not true (called delusions), or feel unusually suspicious of others. negative means a lack of behaviours or feelings that are normally present. for example, a person with schizophrenia may appear withdrawn and may not respond at all emotionally or may have trouble speaking in a clear and logical way. people with this disease may also feel depressed, anxious, guilty, or tense. trevicta can help alleviate the symptoms of your disease and reduce the chance

patients with dementia. however, elderly patients with dementia, who are treated with other similar types of medicine, may have an increased risk of stroke or death (see section 4). all medicines have side effects and some of the side effects of this medicine can worsen the symptoms of other medical conditions. for that reason, it is important to discuss with your doctor any of the following conditions which can potentially worsen during treatment with this medicine: - if you have parkinson's disease - if you have ever been diagnosed with a condition whose symptoms include high temperature and muscle stiffness (also known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome) - if you have ever experienced twitching or jerking movements that you cannot control in your face, tongue, or other parts of your body (tardive dyskinesia) - if you know that you have had low levels of white blood cells in the past (which may or may not have been caused by other medicines) - if you are diabetic or prone to diabetes - if you have had breast cancer or a tumour in the pituitary gland in your brain - if you have a heart disease or heart disease treatment that makes you prone to low blood pressure - if you have low blood pressure when you stand up or sit up suddenly - if you have a history of seizures - if you have kidney problems - if you have liver problems - if you have prolonged and/or painful erection - if you have problems with controlling body temperature or overheating - if you have an abnormally high level of the hormone prolactin in your blood or if you have a possible prolactin-dependent tumour - if you or someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as antipsychotics have been associated with formation of blood clots. if you have any of these conditions, please talk to your doctor as he/she may want to adjust your dose or monitor you for a while. as dangerously low numbers of a certain type of white blood cell needed to fight infection in your blood has been seen very rarely with patients taking this medicine, your doctor may check your white blood cell counts. even if you have previously tolerated oral paliperidone or risperidone, rarely allergic reactions occur after receiving injections of trevicta. seek medical attention right away if you experience a rash, swelling of your throat, itching, or problems breathing as these may be signs of a serious allergic reaction. this medicine may cause you to gain weight. significant weight gain may be bad for your health. your doctor should regularly measure your body weight. as

side effects such as sleepiness or other effects on the brain such as other psychiatric medications, opioids, antihistamines and sleep medication. since this medicine can lower blood pressure, care should be taken when this medicine is used with other medicines that lower blood pressure. this medicine can reduce the effect of medicines against parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome (e.g., levodopa). this medicine may cause an electrocardiogram (ecg) abnormality demonstrating a long time for an electrical impulse to travel through a certain part of the heart (known as \"qt prolongation\"). other medicines that have this effect include some medicines used to treat the rhythm of the heart or to treat infection, and other antipsychotics. if you have a history of seizures,
