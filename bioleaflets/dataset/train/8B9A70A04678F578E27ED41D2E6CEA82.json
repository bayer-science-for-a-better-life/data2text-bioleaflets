QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains nominally 250/500/1000/2000/3000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (INN: \noctocog alfa). \nHuman coagulation factor VIII is produced by recombinant DNA technology (rDNA) in baby hamster \nkidney cells containing the human factor VIII gene.  \n \n\uf0b7 One mL Helixate NexGen 250 IU contains approximately 100 IU (250 IU / 2.5 mL) of \n\nrecombinant human coagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water \nfor injections. \n\n\uf0b7 One mL Helixate NexGen 500 IU contains approximately 200 IU (500 IU / 2.5 mL) of \nrecombinant human coagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water \nfor injections. \n\n\uf0b7 One mL Helixate NexGen 1000 IU contains approximately 400 IU (1000 IU / 2.5 mL) of \nrecombinant human coagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water \nfor injections. \n\n\uf0b7 One mL Helixate NexGen 2000 IU contains approximately 400 IU (2000 IU / 5 mL) of \nrecombinant human coagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water \nfor injections. \n\n\uf0b7 One mL Helixate NexGen 3000 IU contains approximately 600 IU (3000 IU / 5 mL) of \nrecombinant human coagulation factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution with water \nfor injections. \n\n \nThe potency (IU) is determined using the one-stage clotting assay against the FDA Mega standard \nwhich was calibrated against WHO standard in International Units (IU). \nThe specific activity of Helixate NexGen is approximately 4000 IU/mg protein. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection.  \n \nPowder: dry white to slightly yellow powder or cake.  \nSolvent: water for injection, a clear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in \nvon Willebrand's disease. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nThis product is indicated for adults, adolescents and children of all ages. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. \n \nPosology \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \nrelated to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is \nexpressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative \nto the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).  \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in \none mL of normal human plasma.  \n \nOn demand treatment \n \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that \n1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% \nto 2.5% of normal activity. The required dose is determined using the following formulae: \n \nI. Required IU = body weight (kg) \u00d7 desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) \u00d7 0.5 \n \nII. Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =  2 \u00d7 administered IU \n  body weight (kg) \n \nThe dose, frequency and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the \npatient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the \nbleeding, the presence of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels. In the case of the \nhaemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in % of \nnormal) in the corresponding period: \n \nTable 1: Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/  \nType of surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) (IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/ \nDuration of therapy (days)  \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleed or oral bleed  \n\n \n \n\n20 - 40 \n\n \n \nRepeat every 12 to 24 hours. At \nleast 1 day, until the bleeding \nepisode as indicated by pain is \nresolved or healing is achieved. \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleed or haematoma \n\n30 - 60 Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours \nfor 3 - 4 days or more until pain and \ndisability are resolved. \n\nLife threatening haemorrhages \n(such as intracranial bleed, \nthroat bleed, severe abdominal \nbleed) \n\n60 - 100 Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor \nincluding tooth extraction \n\n \n \n\n30 - 60 \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \nhealing is achieved. \n\nMajor 80 - 100 \n(pre- and \n\npostoperative) \n\na) By bolus infusions \nRepeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours \nuntil adequate wound healing \noccurs, then continue with therapy \nfor at least another 7 days to \nmaintain a factor VIII activity of \n30% to 60% (IU/dl). \nb) By continuous infusion \nRaise factor VIII activity pre-\nsurgery with an initial bolus \ninfusion and immediately follow \nwith continuous infusion (in \nIU/kg/h) adjusting according to \npatient\u2019s daily clearance and desired \nfactor VIII levels for at least 7 days. \n\n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted \naccording to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case. Under certain circumstances larger \namounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.  \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to \nguide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions. In the case of \nmajor surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of \ncoagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in \ntheir response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. \n \nContinuous infusion \n \nFor the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery \ndecay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 mL/h/kg) and then adjust \naccordingly.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nInfusion rate (in IU/kg/h) = Clearance (in mL/h/kg) \u00d7 desired factor VIII level (in IU/mL) \n \nFor continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps \nwith a PVC reservoir. Helixate NexGen contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is \nknown to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride \n(PVC) materials. This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration. \n \nProphylaxis \n \nFor long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are \n20 to 40 IU of Helixate NexGen per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.  \nIn some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Helixate NexGen in children of all ages have been established. Data have \nbeen obtained from clinical studies in 61 children under 6 years of age and non-interventional studies \nin children of all ages. \n \nPatients with inhibitors \nPatients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors. If the expected plasma \nfactor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an \nassay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present. If the inhibitor is present at \nlevels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per mL, administration of additional recombinant coagulation \nfactor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with Helixate \nNexGen. However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted \naccording to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity. In patients with inhibitor \ntitres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex \nconcentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered. \nThese therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntravenous use. \n \nHelixate NexGen should be injected intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes. The rate of administration \nshould be determined by the patient\u2019s comfort level (maximal rate of infusion: 2 mL/min).  \n \nContinuous infusion \n \nHelixate NexGen can be infused by continuous infusion. The infusion rate should be calculated based \non the clearance and the desired FVIII level.  \nExample: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 mL/h/kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 \nIU/h/kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%. For calculation of mL/hour, multiply infusion rate in \nIU/h/kg by kg bw/concentration of solution (IU/mL).  \n \nMe\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 2: Example for calculation of infusion rate for continuous infusion after initial bolus \ninjection \n Desired plasma \n\nFVIII level  \nInfusion rate \nIU/h/kg \n\nInfusion rate for 75 kg patient \nmL/h \n\nClearance:    \n3 mL/h/kg \n\n  Concentrations of rFVIII solution \n100 IU/mL    200 IU/mL   400 \nIU/mL \n\n 100 % (1 IU/mL) 3.0 2.25               1.125          0.56 \n  60 % (0.6 IU/mL) 1.8 1.35                0.68           0.34 \n  40 % (0.4 IU/mL) 1.2 0.9                  0.45           0.225 \n \nHigher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings \nor extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions. \nAfter the initial 24 hours of continuous infusion, the clearance should be recalculated every day using \nthe steady state equation with the measured FVIII level and the rate of infusion using the following \nequation:  \nclearance = infusion rate/actual FVIII level. \nDuring continuous infusion, infusion bags should be changed every 24 hours. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and \nthe package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Known allergic reactions to mouse or hamster protein. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity  \n \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Helixate NexGen. The product contains \ntraces of mouse and hamster proteins and human proteins other than factor VIII (see section 5.1). \n \nIf symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue the use of the \nmedicinal product immediately and contact their physician. \n \nPatients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, nausea, \ngeneralised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.  \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \n \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) \nper mL of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the \nseverity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first \n20 exposure days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.  \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less risk of insufficient \nclinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.  \nIf the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with \nan appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with \nhigh levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should \nbe considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the \ncare of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nContinuous infusion \n \nIn a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent \nthrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially \u201csodium \nfree\u201d. \n \nCardiovascular events \n \nHaemophilic patients with cardiovascular risk factors or diseases may be at the same risk to develop \ncardiovascular events as non-haemophilic patients when clotting has been normalised by treatment \nwith FVIII. Elevation of FVIII levels following administration, in particular with existing \ncardiovascular risk factors, might put a patient into the same risk for vessel closure or myocardial \ninfarction as for the non-haemophilic population. Consequently, patients should be evaluated and \nmonitored for cardiac risk factors. \n \nCatheter-related complications \n \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nDocumentation \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Helixate NexGen is administered to a patient, the \nname and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and \nthe batch of the medicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. \n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of Helixate NexGen with other medicinal products have been reported. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Helixate NexGen. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nBased on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of Helixate \nNexGen during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, Helixate NexGen should be \nused during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no fertility data available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines \n \nHelixate NexGen has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \nwith recombinant factor VIII products and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis \n(including shock). In particular the skin related reactions may occur commonly, whereas a progress to \nsevere anaphylaxis (including shock) is considered to be rare. \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with Helixate NexGen.  If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest \nitself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised \nhaemophilia centre be contacted. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level).  \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common: (\uf0b31/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 3: Frequency of adverse drug reactions \nMedDRA \nStandard \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nFrequency \nVery common Common Uncommon Rare Very \n\nRare / not \nknown \n\nBlood and the \nLymphatic \nSystem \nDisorders \n\n FVIII \nInhibition \n(PUPs)* \n\n  FVIII \nInhibition \n(PTPs)* \n\n  \n\nGeneral \nDisorders and \nAdministratio\nn Site \nConditions \n\n Infusion site \nreaction \n\n Infusion related \nfebrile reaction \n(pyrexia) \n\n \n\nImmune \nSystem \nDisorders \n\n Skin associated \nhypersensitivity \nreactions, \n(pruritus, \nurticaria and \nrash) \n\n Systemic \nHypersensitivit\ny reactions \n(including \nanaphylactic \nreaction, \nnausea, blood \npressure \nabnormal and, \ndizziness) \n\n \n\nNervous \nSystem \nDisorders \n\n    Dysgeusia \n\n* Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \nhaemophilia A.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code B02BD02. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and \nvWF) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophilic patient, factor VIII \nbinds to vWF in the patient\u2019s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor \nIX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts \nprothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. \nHaemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of \nfactor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either \nspontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels \nof factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and \ncorrection of the bleeding tendencies. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDetermination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method \nfor biological activity of factor VIII. The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs. The degree and \nduration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of Helixate NexGen is similar to that \nachieved with plasma-derived factor VIII. \n \nContinuous Infusion \n \nIt has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a \nmajor surgery that Helixate NexGen can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and \npostoperative). In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with \nany other long term intravenous infusions. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nDuring studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of \nmouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation. However, the possibility of allergic \nreactions to constituents, e.g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in \ncertain predisposed patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nImmune Tolerance Induction (ITI) \n \nData on Immune Tolerance Induction have been collected in patients with haemophilia A who had \ndeveloped inhibitors to FVIII. A retrospective review has been done on 40 patients, and 39 patients \nwere included in a prospective investigator-initiated clinical study. Data show that Helixate NexGen \nhas been used to induce immune tolerance. In patients where immune tolerance was achieved the \nbleedings could be prevented or controlled with Helixate NexGen again, and the patients could \ncontinue with prophylactic treatment as maintenance therapy. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise \nof 2 % per IU/kg body weight for Helixate NexGen. This result is similar to the reported values for \nfactor VIII derived from human plasma. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nDistribution and elimination \n \nAfter administration of Helixate NexGen, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase \nexponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours. This is similar to that of plasma-\nderived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx. 13 hours. Additional \npharmacokinetic parameters for Helixate NexGen for bolus injection are: mean residence time \n[MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 mL/h.Mean baseline clearance for \n14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 mL/h corresponding to \n3.0 mL/h/kg (range 1.6-4.6  mL/h/kg).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEven doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to \ndemonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for Helixate NexGen in laboratory animals (mouse, \nrat, rabbit, and dog). \n \nSpecific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and \ncarcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous \nproteins in all non-human mammalian species. \n \nNo studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of Helixate NexGen, since no mutagenic \npotential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of Helixate NexGen.  \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Helixate NexGen is and what it is used for \n \nHelixate NexGencontains the active substance human recombinant coagulation factor VIII (octocog \nalfa). \n \nHelixate NexGen is used for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding adults, adolescents and children of \nall ages with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). \nThis preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not to be used in von \nWillebrand's disease. \n \nThe vial contains a dry white to slightly yellow powder or cake, as well as water for injections to be \nused to reconstitute the contents of the vial. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Helixate NexGen \n \nDo not use Helixate NexGen  \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to octocog alfa or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6 and end of section 2). \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to mouse or hamster protein. \nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTake special care with Helixate NexGen  and talk to your doctor or pharmacist if: \n\n\uf0b7 you experience tightness in the chest, feeling dizzy, feeling sick or faint, or experience \ndizziness on standing, you may be experiencing a rare severe sudden allergic reaction (a so-\ncalled anaphylactic reaction) to this medicine. If this occurs, stop administering the product \nimmediately and seek medical advice. \n\n\uf0b7 your bleeding is not being controlled with your usual dose of this medicine. The formation of \ninhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all Factor \nVIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly \nand you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \nyour or your child\u2019s bleeding is not being controlled with Helixate NexGen, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n\uf0b7 you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products, \nyou may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back. \n\n\uf0b7 you have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease. \n\uf0b7 you require a central venous access device (CVAD) for the administration of Helixate \n\nNexGen. You may be at risk of CVAD-related complications including local infections, \nbacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and the formation of a blood clot in the blood vessel \n(thrombosis) where the catheter is inserted. \n\n \nYour doctor may carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of this medicine provides adequate \nfactor VIII levels. \n \nOther medicines and Helixate NexGen \nInteractions with other medicines are not known. However, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply to patients of all ages, adults and children. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nExperience regarding fertility or the use of Helixate NexGen during pregnancy and breast-feeding is \nnot available. Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are \nplanning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. \nHelixate NexGen is not likely to affect the fertility in male or female patients, as the active substance \nis naturally occurring in the body. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo effects on ability to drive or use machines have been observed. \n \nHelixate NexGen contains sodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per vial and is therefore considered \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \nDocumentation \nIt is recommended that every time that you use Helixate NexGen, the name and batch number of the \nproduct are documented. \n \n \n3. How to use Helixate NexGen \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor or pharmacist has told \nyou. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\nTreatment of bleeding \nYour doctor will calculate the dose of this medicine and how frequently you should use it to get the \nnecessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood. The doctor should always adjust the dose and the \nfrequency of administration according to your individual needs. How much Helixate NexGen you \nshould use and how often you should use it depends on many factors such as:  \n\n\uf0b7 your weight \n\uf0b7 the severity of your haemophilia \n\uf0b7 where the bleed is and how serious it is \n\uf0b7 whether you have inhibitors and how high the inhibitor titre is \n\uf0b7 the factor VIII level that is needed. \n\n \nPrevention of bleeding \nIf you are using Helixate NexGen to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the \ndose for you. This will usually be in the range of 20 to 40 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, \ngiven every 2 to 3 days. However, in some cases, especially for younger patients, shorter dose \nintervals or higher doses may be necessary.  \n \nLaboratory tests \nIt is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable \nintervals to ensure that adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained. For major \nsurgery in particular, close monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis \nmust be carried out. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nHelixate NexGen can be used in children of all ages. \n \nIf bleeding is not controlled \nIf the factor VIII level in your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled \nafter apparently adequate dose, you may have developed factor VIII inhibitors. This must be checked \nby an experienced doctor. \nIf you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your \ndoctor.  \n \nPatients with inhibitors \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you may need to \nuse a larger amount of this medicine to control bleeding. If this dose does not control your bleeding \nyour doctor may consider giving you an additional product, factor VIIa concentrate or (activated) \nprothrombin complex concentrate.  \nThese treatments should be prescribed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A. Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this. \nDo not increase your dose of medicine you use to control your bleeding without consulting your \ndoctor. \n \nDuration of treatment \nYour doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals this medicine is to be administered. \nUsually, the substitution therapy with Helixate NexGen is a life-time treatment. \n \nHow Helixate NexGen is given \n \nThis medicine is intended for injection into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume \nand your comfort level and should be used  within 3 hours after preparing the solution.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\nHow Helixate NexGen is prepared for administration \nUse only the items that are provided with each package of this medicine. If these components cannot \nbe used, please contact your doctor. If any component of the package is opened or damaged, do not \nuse it. \n \nYou must filter the reconstituted product before administration to remove any possible particles  in the \nsolution. You are filtering by using the Mix2Vial adapter. \n \nThis medicine must not be mixed with other infusion solutions. Do not use solutions containing \nvisible particles or that are cloudy. Follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the \ndetailed instructions for reconstitution and administration provided at the end of this leaflet.  \n \nIf you use more Helixate NexGen than you should \nNo cases of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.  \nIf you have used more Helixate NexGen than you should, please inform your doctor. \n \nIf you forget to use Helixate NexGen \n\u2022 Proceed with your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your \n\ndoctor.  \n\u2022 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you want to stop using Helixate NexGen \nDo not stop using Helixate NexGen without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nThe most serious side effects are hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylactic shock (rare side effect). \nIf allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/infusion should be stopped immediately. \nPlease consult your doctor immediately. \n \nFor children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) \nmay form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients); however patients who have received previous \ntreatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than \n1 in 100 patients). If this happens your or your child\u2019s medicines may stop working properly and you \nor your child may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n \nOther possible side effects: \n \nCommon  may affect up to 1 in 10 users): \n\u2022 rash/itchy rash \n\u2022 local reactions where you injected the medication (e.g. burning sensation, temporary redness) \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 users): \n\u2022 hypersensitivity reactions including severe sudden allergic reaction (which may include hives, \n\nnausea, urticaria, angioedema, chills, flushing, headache, lethargy, wheezing or difficulty \nbreathing, restlessness, tachycardia, tingling or anaphylactic shock, e.g. tightness of the \nchest/general feeling of being unwell, dizziness and nausea and mildly reduced blood pressure, \nwhich may make you feel faint upon standing) \n\n\u2022 fever \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\u2022 dysgeusia (strange taste) \n \nIf you notice any of the following symptoms during injection/infusion: \n\u2022 chest tightness/general feeling of being unwell  \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon \n\nstanding) \n\u2022 nausea \nthis can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.  \nIf allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/infusion should be stopped immediately. \nPlease consult your doctor immediately.  \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nDuring clinical studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace \namounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation. The possibility of allergic \nreactions to substances contained in this medication, e.g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein \nexists in certain predisposed patients. \n \nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. \n \n2. Warm both unopened vials in your hands to a comfortable temperature (do not exceed 37 \u00b0C). \n \n3. Ensure product and solvent vial flip caps are removed and the stoppers are treated with an \n\nantiseptic solution and allowed to dry prior to opening the Mix2Vial package. \n \n4. Open the Mix2Vial package by peeling away the lid. Do not remove the \n\nMix2Vial from the blister package! \n \n\n4 \n5. Place the solvent vial on an even, clean surface and hold the vial tight. Take \n\nthe Mix2Vial together with the blister package and push the spike of the \nblue adapter end straight down through the solvent vial stopper. \n\n \n\n5 \n6. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial set by holding at \n\nthe rim, and pulling vertically upwards. Make sure that you only pull away \nthe blister package and not the Mix2Vial set. \n\n \n\n6 \n7. Place the product vial on an even and firm surface. Invert the solvent vial \n\nwith the Mix2Vial set attached and push the spike of the transparent \nadapter end straight down through the product vial stopper. The solvent \nwill automatically flow into the product vial. \n\n \n\n7 \n8. With one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set and with the other \n\nhand grasp the solvent-side and unscrew counter clockwise the set carefully \ninto two pieces. Discard the solvent vial with the blue Mix2Vial adapter \nattached. \n\n \n\n8 \n9. Gently swirl the product vial with the transparent adapter attached until the \n\nsubstance is fully dissolved. Do not shake. Carefully check for particles and \ndiscoloration before administration. Do not use solutions containing visible \nparticles or that are cloudy. \n\n 9 \n10.  Draw air into an empty, sterile syringe. While the product vial is upright, \n\nconnect the syringe to the Mix2Vial\u00b4s Luer Lock fitting by screwing \nclockwise.

While keeping the syringe plunger pressed, turn the system upside down and \ndraw the solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly. \n\n \n\n11 \n12. Now that the solution has been transferred into the syringe, firmly hold on to \n\nthe barrel of the syringe (keeping the syringe plunger facing down) and \ndisconnect the transparent Mix2Vial adapter from the syringe by unscrewing \ncounter clockwise. Hold the syringe upright and push the plunger until no air \nis left in the syringe. \n\n12 \n13. Apply a tourniquet to your arm. \n \n14. Determine the point of injection and clean the skin with an alcohol swab.  \n \n15. Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster. \n \n16. Let blood flow back to the open end of the venipuncture set and then attach the syringe with the \n\nsolution. Make sure that no blood enters the syringe. \n \n17. Remove tourniquet. \n \n18. Inject the solution into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the needle. \n\nThe speed of injection should be based on your comfort, but should not be faster than 2.0 mL \nper minute. \n\n \n19. If a further dose needs to be administered, use a new syringe with product reconstituted as \n\ndescribed above. \n \n20. If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe. Hold a pad firmly over \n\nthe injection site on your outstretched arm for about  2 minutes. Finally, apply a small pressure \ndressing to the injection site  and consider if a plaster is necessary. \n\n \n \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnex IV \n\nScientific conclusions  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\nScientific conclusions  \n\nTreatment of congenital haemophilia is currently based on prophylactic or on-demand replacement \ntherapy with coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). FVIII replacement therapy can be generally \ncategorised into two broad classes of products; plasma derived (pdFVIII) and recombinant (rFVIII) \nFVIII. A wide range of individual pdFVIII and rFVIII products are authorised for use in the \nEuropean Union.  \n\nA major complication of FVIII therapy is the occurrence of IgG alloantibodies (inhibitors) that \nneutralise FVIII activity, causing loss of bleeding control. Treatment of patients who have \ndeveloped inhibitors requires careful individual management and can be resistant to therapy.  \n\nTreatment with both pdFVIII and rFVIII can lead to development of inhibitors (tested with the \nNijmegen method of the Bethesda assay and defined as \u2265 0.6 Bethesda units (BU) for \u201ca low titre\u201d \ninhibitor and >5 BU for a \u201chigh-titre\u201d inhibitor). \n\nThe occurrence of inhibitor development in haemophilia A patients receiving FVIII products mostly \noccurs in previously-untreated patients (PUPs) or minimally treated patients (MTPs) who are still \nwithin the first 50 days of exposure (EDs) to the treatment. Inhibitors are less likely to occur in \npreviously-treated patients (PTPs).  \n\nThe known risk factors for inhibitor development can be grouped into patient and treatment-related \nfactors:  \n\n\uf0b7 Patient-related risk factors include type of F8 gene mutation, severity of haemophilia, \nethnicity, family history of inhibitor development and possibly HLA-DR (Human Leukocyte \nAntigen - antigen D Related) constitution.  \n\n\uf0b7 Treatment-related factors include intensity of exposure, number of exposure days (EDs), on \ndemand treatment posing a greater risk than prophylaxis, particularly in the context of \ndanger signals such as trauma or surgery, and young age at first treatment poses a higher \nrisk.  \n\nWhether there are significant differences in the risk of inhibitor development between different \ntypes of FVIII replacement product remains an area of uncertainty. Differences between products \nin each FVIII class  and consequently differential risks between individual products, are biologically \nplausible. The pdFVIII class consists of products with or without Von Willebrand Factor (VWF), and \nthose with VWF contain a range of VWF levels. Some experimental studies have suggested a role \nfor VWF in protecting FVIII epitopes from recognition by the antigen-presenting cells, thereby \nreducing immunogenicity, although this remains theoretical. VWF is not present in rFVIII, but there \nis significant heterogeneity within the rFVIII class for instance due to the different manufacturing \nprocesses used, with a wide range of products from different manufacturers produced over the past \n20 years. These different manufacturing processes (including the different cell lines used to \nengineer the rFVIII products) can in theory lead to differential immunogenicity. \n\nIn May 2016, an open-label, randomised controlled trial aimed at addressing the incidence of \ninhibitors between the two classes (pdFVIII vs. rFVIII products) was published in the New England \nJournal of Medicine1. This trial, known as the SIPPET study (\u201cSurvey of Inhibitors in Plasma-Product \nExposed Toddlers\u201d) was conducted to evaluate the relative risk of inhibitors in patients treated with \npdFVIII compared to rFVIII. It found that patients treated with rFVIII products had an 87% higher \nincidence of all inhibitors than those treated with pdFVIII (which contained VWF) (hazard ratio, \n1.87; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.96).  \n\n                                                      \n1 F.

The \nreferral focuses on the risk of inhibitor development in PUPs.  \n\nFurther to the recent publication on the SIPPET study, the MAHs were requested to assess the \npotential impact of the results of this study and other relevant safety data on inhibitor development \nin PUPs on the MA of their FVIII product including consideration on risk minimisation measures.  \n\nThe lead authors of the SIPPET study were also invited to respond to a list of questions regarding \nthe study methods and findings and to present their conclusions at the February 2017 PRAC \nplenary meeting. Information submitted by the lead authors of the SIPPET study during the course \nof the referral was also taken into consideration by PRAC in reaching its conclusion.  \n\nClinical discussion  \n\nPublished observational studies \n\nThe responses of MAHs referred to a range of published observational studies (the CANAL, RODIN, \nFranceCoag, UKHCDO, amongst others) which have sought to evaluate any differential risks of \ninhibitor development between the classes of pdFVIII and rFVIII, as well as any differential risk of \ninhibitor development between products within the rFVIII class.  \n\nThese studies have yielded different results and suffer from the limitations of observational studies, \nand in particular from possible selection bias. The risk of inhibitor development is multifactorial \n(aside from any putative product-specific risk), and such studies have not always been able to \ncollect information on relevant covariates and to adjust the analyses accordingly; residual \nconfounding is inevitably a significant uncertainty. Furthermore, over time there have been \nchanges in manufacturing process of individual products and changes in treatment regimens \nbetween centres, hence \u201clike for like\u201d comparisons between products is not always possible. These \nfactors make control of such studies and interpretation of the results challenging. \n\nThe CANAL study2 found no evidence of a class difference, including pdFVIII products with \nconsiderable quantities of von Willebrand factor; for \u2018clinically relevant\u2019 inhibitors the adjusted \nhazard ratio was 0.7 (95% CI 0.4-1.1), and for high titre inhibitors (\u22655 BU) was 0.8 (95% CI 0.4-\n1.3).  \n\nThe RODIN/Pednet study3 also found no evidence of a class difference in inhibitor risk between all \npdFVIII vs all rFVIII; for \u2018clinically relevant\u2019 inhibitors the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.96 (95% CI \n0.62-1.49), and for high titre inhibitors (\u22655 BU/ml) was 0.95 (95% CI 0.56-1.61). However, the \nstudy found evidence of an increased risk of inhibitors (all and high titre) for 2nd generation rFVIII \noctocog alfa (Kogenate FS/Helixate NexGen) compared with 3rd generation rFVIII octocog alfa \n(which was driven solely by data for Advate). \n\nSimilar to RODIN/Pednet, the UKHCDO study found a significant increased risk of inhibitors (all and \nhigh titre) for Kogenate FS/Helixate NexGen (2nd generation rFVIII) compared to Advate (3rd \ngeneration rFVIII). Although this became non-significant when UK patients (also included in the \nRODIN/Pednet study were excluded. There was also evidence for an increased risk with Refacto AF \n(another 3rd generation rFVIII) vs Advate, but only for all inhibitor development. Like the UKHCDO \n\n                                                      \n2 http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/109/11/4648.full.pdf \n3 Gouw SC et al. PedNet and RODIN Study Group.

In 2013, PRAC had concluded that the RODIN/Pednet findings were not sufficiently \nrobust to support a conclusion that Kogenate FS/Helixate NexGen was associated with an increased \nrisk of developing factor VIII inhibitors compared with other products. In 2016, PRAC had \nconsidered the findings of meta-analysis of all three studies (RODIN/Pednet, UKHCDO and \nFranceCoag studies), and again concluded that the currently available evidence does not confirm \nthat Kogenate Bayer/Helixate NexGen is associated with an increased risk of factor VIII inhibitors, \ncompared with other recombinant factor VIII products in PUPs. \n\n  MAH-sponsored studies \n\nThe MAHs provided an analysis of low and high titre inhibitor development in PUPs with severe \nhaemophilia A (FVIII < 1%) from all clinical trials and observational studies conducted with their \nproducts, along with critical discussion on the limitations of these studies.   \n\nThe data came from a very wide range of heterogenous studies across products and over time. \nMany of these studies were small and not specifically designed to evaluate the inhibitor risk in PUPs \nwith severe haemophilia A. The studies were mostly single arm and do not provide data to perform \ncomparative analysis (either between pdFVIII and rFVIII as a class comparison, or within the rFVIII \nclass). However, the general estimates of inhibitor rates from these studies for individual products \nare broadly in line with the findings from large observational studies. \n\nOf the larger and more relevant studies for pdFVIII products, inhibitor rates observed (often not \nstated if high or low titre) ranged from 3.5 to 33%, with most around 10-25%. However, in many \ncases little information was provided on the methods, patient populations and nature of the \ninhibitors to assess the information in the context of more recent published data. For most rFVIII \nproducts, newer and more relevant information from clinical trials in PUPs is available. Inhibitor \nrates in these studies range from 15 to 38% for all inhibitors and 9 to 22.6% for high titre \ninhibitors; i.e. within the range of \u2018very common\u2019.  \n\nThe PRAC also considered interim results submitted by the MAHs from ongoing studies from CSL \n(CRD019_5001) and Bayer (Leopold KIDS, 13400, part B.). \n\nFurthermore, the PRAC examined clinical trials and the scientific literature for de novo inhibitors in \nPTPs. The analysis demonstrated that the frequency of inhibitor development is much lower in PTPs \ncompared to PUPs. The available data showed that in many studies including the EUHASS registry \n(Iorio A, 20174; Fischer K, 20155) the frequency could be classified as \u201cuncommon\u201d.  \n\nThe SIPPET study \n\nThe SIPPET study was an open-label, randomized, multi-centre, multi-national trial investigating \nthe incidence of neutralising allo-antibodies in patients with severe congenital haemophilia A \n(plasma FVIII concentration<1%) with either the use of pdFVIII or rFVIII concentrates.

The primary and \nsecondary outcomes assessed in the study were the incidence of all inhibitors (\u22650.4 BU/ml) and \nthe incidence of high-titre inhibitors (\u22655 BU/ml), respectively. \n\nInhibitors developed in 76 patients, 50 of whom had high-titre inhibitors (\u22655 BU). Inhibitors \ndeveloped in 29 of the 125 patients treated with pdFVIII (20 patients had high-titre inhibitors) and \nin 47 of the 126 patients treated with rFVIII (30 patients had high-titre inhibitors). The cumulative \nincidence of all inhibitors was 26.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.4 to 35.2) with pdFVIII and \n44.5% (95% CI, 34.7 to 54.3) with rFVIII; the cumulative incidence of high-titre inhibitors was \n18.6% (95% CI, 11.2 to 26.0) and 28.4% (95% CI, 19.6 to 37.2), respectively. In Cox regression \nmodels for the primary end point of all inhibitors, rFVIII was associated with an 87% higher \nincidence than pdFVIII (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.96). This association was \nconsistently observed in multivariable analysis. For high-titre inhibitors, the hazard ratio was 1.69 \n(95% CI, 0.96 to 2.98).  \n\n Ad hoc expert group meeting \n\nThe PRAC considered the views expressed by experts during an ad-hoc meeting. The expert group \nwas of the view that the relevant available data sources have been considered. The expert group \nsuggested that further data are needed to establish if there are clinically relevant differences in \nfrequency of inhibitor development between different factor VIII products and that, in principle, \nsuch data should be collected separately for individual products, as degree of immunogenicity will \nbe difficult to generalise across the classes of products (i.e. recombinant vs. plasma-derived). \n\nThe experts also agreed that the degree of immunogenicity of different products was adequately \ndescribed overall with the amendments to the SmPC proposed by the PRAC highlighting the clinical \nrelevance of inhibitor development (in particular low compared to high titre inhibitors), as well as \nthe  frequency of \u2018very common\u2019 in PUPs and \u2018uncommon\u2019 in PTPs. The experts also suggested \nstudies which could further characterise the immunogenic properties of the factor VIII medicinal \nproducts (e.g. mechanistic, observational studies).   \n\nDiscussion  \n\nThe PRAC considered that as a prospective randomised trial, the SIPPET study avoided many of the \ndesign limitations of the observational and registry-based studies undertaken so far to evaluate the \nrisk of inhibitor development in PUPs. However the PRAC is of the view that there are uncertainties \nwith regards to the findings of the SIPPET study which preclude the conclusion that there is a \nhigher risk of inhibitor development in PUPs treated with rFVIII products than pdFVIII products \nstudied in this clinical trial, as detailed below:   \n\n\uf0b7 The SIPPET analysis does not allow for product-specific conclusions to be made as it relates \nonly to a small number of certain FVIII products. The study was not designed and powered \nto generate sufficient product-specific data and, therefore, to draw any conclusions on the \nrisk of inhibitor development for individual products. In particular, only 13 patients (10% of \nthe FVIII arm) received a third generation rFVIII product. However, despite the lack of \nrobust evidence to support differential risks between rFVIII products, differential risks \ncannot be excluded, as this is a heterogeneous product class with differences in \ncomposition and formulations. Therefore, there is a high degree of uncertainty around \nextrapolating the SIPPET findings to the entire rFVIII class, particularly for more recently-\nauthorised rFVIII products which were not included in the SIPPET trial.  \n\n\uf0b7 The SIPPET study has methodological limitations, with particular uncertainty around whether \nthe randomisation process (block size of 2) may have introduced a selection bias in the \nstudy.   \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n\n\uf0b7 There were also deviations from the final protocol and statistical analysis plan. The statistical \nconcerns include the fact that no pre-specified primary analysis has been published and the \nfact that the study was stopped early following the publication of the RODIN study \nindicating that Kogenate FS might be associated with an increased risk of inhibitor \nformation. Although this could not have been prevented, an early termination of an open \nlabel trial raises the possibility of investigator bias and inflation of the probability of \ndetecting an effect that is not present. \n\n\uf0b7 Treatment regimens in EU are different from those in the SIPPET study. The relevance for \nclinical practice in the EU (and therefore for the products subject to this procedure) is \ntherefore questioned. It is uncertain whether the findings of SIPPET can be extrapolated to \nthe risk of inhibitors in PUPs in current clinical practice in the EU as treatment modality and \nintensity have been suggested as risk factors for inhibitor development in previous studies. \nImportantly, the EU SmPCs do not include modified prophylaxis (as defined in the SIPPET \nstudy) as an authorised posology, and the impact of the apparent imbalance in the \nunspecified other combinations of treatment modality on the SIPPET findings is unclear. \nTherefore, it remains uncertain whether the same differential risk of inhibitor development \nobserved in the SIPPET study would be apparent in patient populations treated in routine \ncare in other countries where the modality of treatment (i.e. primary prophylaxis) is \ndifferent from that in the study. The additional points of clarification provided by the \nSIPPET authors do not fully resolve this uncertainty. \n\nHaving considered the abovementioned results from SIPPET, the published literature and all the \ninformation submitted by the MAHs, as well as the views expressed by experts expressed at the \nad-hoc expert meeting, the PRAC concluded that: \n\n\uf0b7 Inhibitor development is an identified risk with both pdFVIII and rFVIII products. Although \nthe clinical studies for some individual products have identified limited numbers of cases of \ninhibitor development, these tend to be small studies with methodological limitations, or \nstudies not adequately designed to evaluate this risk. \n\n\uf0b7 The FVIII products are heterogenous, and the plausibility of different rates of inhibitor \ndevelopment between individual products cannot be excluded.  \n\n\uf0b7 Individual studies have identified a wide range of inhibitor development across products, but \nthe direct comparability of study results is questionable based on diversity of study \nmethods and patient populations over time.  \n\n\uf0b7 The SIPPET study was not designed to evaluate the risk of inhibitor development for \nindividual products, and included a limited number of FVIII products. Due to heterogeneity \nacross products, there is considerable uncertainty in extrapolating the findings of studies \nthat have evaluated only class effects to individual products; and particularly to products \n(including more recently authorised products) which are not included in such studies. \n\n\uf0b7 Finally, the PRAC noted that to date most studies evaluating a differential risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment between classes of FVIII products suffer from a variety of potential \nmethodological limitations and based on the available data considered there is no clear and \nconsistent evidence to suggest differences in relative risk between classes of FVIII \nproducts. Specifically, the findings from the SIPPET study, as well as those from the \nindividual clinical trials and observational studies included in the MAH responses, are not \nsufficient to confirm any consistent statistically and clinically meaningful differences in \ninhibitor risk between the rFVIII and pdFVIII product classes. \n\nIn view of the above, the PRAC recommended the following updates of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of \nthe SmPC as well as sections 2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet for the FVIII products indicated for the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\ntreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency) as follows: \n\n\uf0b7 The section 4.4 of the SmPC should be amended to include a warning on the clinical \nimportance of monitoring patients for FVIII inhibitor development (in particular warning on \nthe clinical consequences of low compared to high titre inhibitors).  \n\n\uf0b7 With regards to sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, the PRAC noted that several FVIII \nproducts currently include reference to data from study results which do not allow for a \ndefinite conclusion on the inhibitor risk for individual products. As the evidence suggests \nthat all human FVIII products carry a risk of inhibitor development such statements should \nbe removed. The available data supports a frequency of FVIII inhibitor development within \nthe frequency of \u2018very common\u2019 and \u2018uncommon\u2019, for PUPs and PTPs respectively, therefore \nthe PRAC recommends that the SmPCs should be aligned with these frequencies unless \njustified by product specific data. For products for which section 4.2 contains the following \nstatement for PUPs: \u201c<Previously untreated patients. The safety and efficacy of \n{(Invented) name} in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. No data \nare available. >), the above frequency for PUPs should not be implemented. In relation to \nsection 5.1, any reference to inhibitor development studies in PUPs and PTPs should be \ndeleted unless the studies were conducted in compliance with a Paediatric Investigation \nPlan or the studies provide robust evidence of a frequency of inhibitors in PUP which is less \nthan \u2018very common\u2019 or for PTPs which is different from \u2018uncommon\u2019 (as laid down in the \nattachments of the PRAC AR). \n\nFurther to the assessment of the totality of the responses submitted by the MAH for susoctocog \nalfa (Obizur), the PRAC is of the opinion that the outcome of this article 31 referral procedure does \nnot apply to this product in view of the indication of Obizur (acquired haemophilia A due to \ninhibitory antibodies to endogenous FVIII) and the different target population. \n\nBenefit \u2013risk balance \n\nBased on the current evidence from the SIPPET study, as well as data from the individual clinical \ntrials and observational studies included in the MAH responses, and the views expressed by the \nexperts of the ad-hoc expert meeting, the PRAC agreed that the current evidence does not provide \nclear and consistent evidence of any statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor \nrisk between rFVIII and pdFVIII products. No conclusions can be drawn on any role of VWF in \nprotecting against inhibitor development. \n\nGiven these are heterogenous products, this does not preclude individual products being associated \nwith an increased risk of inhibitor development in ongoing or future PUP studies. \n\nIndividual studies have identified a wide range of inhibitor frequency in PUPs across products, and \nthe SIPPET study was not designed to differentiate between individual products in each class. Due \nto very different study methods and patient populations that have been studied over time, and \ninconsistent findings across studies, the PRAC found that the totality of evidence does not support \na conclusion that recombinant factor VIII medicines, as a class, poses a greater risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment than the class derived from plasma. \n\nBesides, the PRAC noted that several FVIII products currently include in their product information \nreference to data from study results which do not allow a definite conclusion on the inhibitor risk \nfor individual products. As the evidence suggests that all human FVIII products carry a risk of \ninhibitor development, within the frequency of \u2018very common\u2019 and \u2018uncommon\u2019 for PUPs and PTPs \nrespectively, the PRAC recommends that the SmPCs should be aligned with these frequencies \nunless justified by product specific data. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nIn view of the above, the PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance of Factor VIII products \nindicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital \nfactor VIII deficiency), remains favourable subject to the changes to the product information \nagreed (section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC).  \n\nRe-examination procedure \n\nFollowing the adoption of the PRAC recommendation during the May 2017 PRAC meeting, the MAH \nLFB Biomedicaments expressed their disagreement with the initial PRAC recommendation.  \n\nGiven the detailed grounds provided by the MAH, the PRAC carried out a new assessment of the \navailable data in the context of the re-examination.  \n\nPRAC discussion on grounds for re-examination \n\nThe SIPPET study was not designed to evaluate the risk of inhibitor development for individual \nproducts, and included a limited number of FVIII products. Due to heterogeneity across products, \nthere is considerable uncertainty in extrapolating the findings of studies that have evaluated only \nclass effects to individual products; and particularly to products (including more recently authorised \nproducts) which are not included in such studies. The findings from the SIPPET study, as well as \nthose from the individual clinical trials and observational studies, are not sufficient to confirm any \nconsistent statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor risk between the rFVIII and \npdFVIII product classes. \n\nOverall, the PRAC maintains its conclusions that standardised information on the frequency for \nFVIII products in PUP and PTP should be reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC, unless another \nfrequency range for a specific medicinal product is demonstrated by robust clinical studies for \nwhich the results would be summarised in section 5.1. \n\nExpert consultation \n\nThe PRAC consulted an ad-hoc expert meeting on some of the aspects that formed part of the \ndetailed grounds submitted by LFB Biomedicaments. \n\nOverall, the expert group supported the PRAC initial conclusions and agreed that the proposed \nproduct information provides an adequate level of information to appropriately communicate to \nprescribers and patients about the risk of inhibitor development. No additional communication, on \nrisk factors for inhibitor development beyond the product information or any additional risk \nminimisation measures was recommended. \n\nThe group also agreed that specific data about frequency of inhibitors for each product should not \nbe included in the SmPC as the available studies are not adequately powered to draw precise \nconclusions on the absolute frequency for each product or on the relative frequency of inhibitors \nbetween products.  \n\nThe experts emphasized that collaboration between academia, industry and regulators should be \nencouraged to collect harmonised data through registries.  \n\nPRAC conclusions \n\nIn conclusion, further to the initial assessment and the re-examination procedure, PRAC maintains \nits conclusion that the benefit-risk balance of the human plasma derived and recombinant \ncoagulation Factor VIII containing medicinal products remains favourable subject to the agreed \nchanges to the product information (section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC). \n\nThe PRAC adopted a recommendation on 01 September 2017 which was then considered by the \nCHMP, in accordance with Article 107k of Directive 2001/83/EC. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\nOverall summary of the scientific evaluation by the PRAC \n\nWhereas,  \n\n\u2022 The PRAC considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC resulting from \npharmacovigilance data, for human plasma derived and recombinant coagulation factor \nVIII containing medicinal products (see Annex I and Annex A).  \n\n\u2022 The PRAC considered the totality of the data submitted with regards to the risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment for the classes of recombinant and plasma derived FVIII products, in \npreviously untreated patients (PUPs). This included published literature (SIPPET study6), \ndata generated in individual clinical trials and a range of observational studies submitted by \nthe marketing authorisation holders, including the data generated in large multicentre \ncohort studies, data submitted by the national competent authorities of the EU Member \nStates as well as responses provided by the Authors of the SIPPET study. PRAC also \nconsidered grounds submitted by LFB Biomedicaments as basis for their request for re-\nexamination of the PRAC recommendation and the views of two experts meetings held on \n22 February and 3 August 2017. \n\n\u2022 The PRAC noted that the SIPPET study was not designed to evaluate the risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment for individual products, and included a limited number of FVIII products in \ntotal. Due to the heterogeneity across products, there is considerable uncertainty in \nextrapolating the findings of studies evaluating only class effects to individual products; \nand particularly to the products that are not included in such studies. \n\n\u2022 The PRAC also considered that studies conducted to date suffer from a variety of \nmethodological limitations and, on balance, there is no clear and consistent evidence to \nsuggest differences in relative risks between FVIII product classes based on available data. \nSpecifically, the findings from the SIPPET study, as well as those from the individual clinical \ntrials and observational studies included in the MAH responses, are not sufficient to confirm \nany consistent statistically and clinically meaningful differences in inhibitor risk between \nrFVIII and pdFVIII product classes. Given these are heterogenous products, this does not \npreclude individual products being associated with an increased risk of inhibitor \ndevelopment in ongoing or future PUP studies. \n\n\uf0b7 The PRAC noted that the efficacy and safety of Factor VIII products as indicated in the \ntreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A have been \nestablished.Based on the available data, the PRAC considered that SmPC updates for the \nFVIII products are warranted: section 4.4 should be amended to include a warning on the \nclinical importance of monitoring patients for FVIII inhibitor development. With regards to \nsections 4.8 and 5.1, the PRAC noted that several FVIII products currently include \nreference to data from study results which do not allow a definite conclusion on the \ninhibitor risk for individual products. Results of clinical studies not sufficiently robust (e.g. \nsuffering from methodolical limitations) should not be reflected in the product information \non FVIIII products. The PRAC recommended changes to the product information \naccordingly. Besides, as the evidence suggests that all human FVIII products carry a risk of \ninhibitor development, within the frequency of \u2018very common\u2019 and \u2018uncommon\u2019, for PUPs \nand PTPs respectively, the PRAC recommended that the product information of these \nproducts should be aligned with these frequencies unless justified by product specific data.  \n\nTherefore, the PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance of the human plasma derived and \nrecombinant coagulation Factor VIII containing medicinal products remains favourable and \nrecommended the variations to the terms of the marketing authorisations. \n                                                      \n6 Peyvandi F, Mannucci PM, Garagiola I, et al.

treatment of bleeding your doctor will calculate the dose of this medicine and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor viii activity in your blood. the doctor should always adjust the dose and the frequency of administration according to your individual needs. how much helixate nexgen you should use and how often you should use it depends on many factors such as: your weight the severity of your haemophilia where the bleed is and how serious it is whether you have inhibitors and how high the inhibitor titre is the factor viii level that is needed. prevention of bleeding if you are using helixate nexgen to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you. this will usually be in the range of 20 to 40 iu of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, given every 2 to 3 days. however, in some cases, especially for younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. laboratory tests it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that adequate factor viii levels have been reached and are maintained. for major surgery in particular, close monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis must be carried out. use in children and adolescents helixate nexgen can be used in children of all ages. if bleeding is not controlled if the factor viii level in your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dose, you may have developed factor viii inhibitors. this must be checked by an experienced doctor. if you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor. patients with inhibitors if you have been told by your doctor that you have developed factor viii inhibitors you may need to use a larger amount of this medicine to control bleeding. if this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider giving you an additional product, factor viia concentrate or (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate. these treatments should be prescribed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia a. speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this. do not increase your dose of medicine you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor. duration of treatment your doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals this medicine is to be administered. usually, the substitution therapy with helixate nexgen is a life-time treatment. how helixate nexgen is given this medicine is intended for injection into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume and your comfort level and should be used within 3 hours after preparing the solution. how helixate nexgen is prepared for administration use only the items that are provided with each package of this medicine. if these components cannot be used, please contact your doctor. if any component of the package is opened or damaged, do not use it. you must filter the reconstituted product before administration to remove any possible particles in the solution. you are filtering by using the mix2vial adapter. this medicine must not be mixed with other infusion solutions. do not use solutions containing visible particles or that are cloudy. follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the detailed instructions for reconstitution and administration provided at the end of this leaflet. if you use more helixate nexgen than you should no cases of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor viii have been reported. if you have used more helixate nexgen than you should, please inform your doctor. if you forget to use helixate nexgen proceed with your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you want to stop using helixate nexgen do not
