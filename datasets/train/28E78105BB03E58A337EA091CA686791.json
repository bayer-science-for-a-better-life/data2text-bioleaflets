QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nVipdomet 12.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets \nEach tablet contains alogliptin benzoate equivalent to 12.5 mg alogliptin and 850 mg metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nVipdomet 12.5 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets \nEach tablet contains alogliptin benzoate equivalent to 12.5 mg alogliptin and 1000 mg metformin \nhydrochloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nVipdomet 12.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets \nLight yellow, oblong (approximately 21.0 mm long by 10.1 mm wide), biconvex, film-coated tablets \nwith \u201c12.5/850\u201d debossed on one side and \u201c322M\u201d debossed on the other side. \n \nVipdomet 12.5 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets \nPale yellow, oblong (approximately 22.3 mm long by 10.7 mm wide), biconvex, film-coated tablets \nwith \u201c12.5/1000\u201d debossed on one side and \u201c322M\u201d debossed on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVipdomet is indicated in the treatment of adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus: \n \n- as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients, inadequately \n\ncontrolled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone, or those already being treated \nwith the combination of alogliptin and metformin. \n\n \n- in combination with pioglitazone (i.e. triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and \n\nexercise in adult patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin \nand pioglitazone. \n\n \n- in combination with insulin (i.e. triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to \n\nimprove glycaemic control in patients when insulin at a stable dose and metformin alone do not \nprovide adequate glycaemic control. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nFor the different dose regimens Vipdomet is available in strengths of 12.5 mg/850 mg and \n12.5 mg/1,000 mg film-coated tablets. \n \nAdults (\u226518 years old) with normal renal function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\u226590 mL/min) \nThe dose should be individualised on the basis of the patient\u2019s current treatment regimen.  \n \nFor patients inadequately controlled on the maximal tolerated dose of metformin hydrochloride alone, \nthe recommended dose is one tablet of 12.5 mg/850 mg or 12.5 mg/1,000 mg twice daily, \ncorresponding to 25 mg alogliptin plus 1,700 mg or 2,000 mg metformin hydrochloride daily, \ndepending on the dose of metformin hydrochloride already being taken. \n \nFor patients inadequately controlled on dual therapy with a maximal tolerated dose of metformin and \npioglitazone, the dose of pioglitazone should be maintained, and Vipdomet administered \nconcomitantly; alogliptin should be dosed at 12.5 mg twice daily (25 mg total daily dose) and \nmetformin hydrochloride at a similar dose (either 850 mg or 1,000 mg twice daily) to that already \nbeing taken. \n \nCaution should be exercised when alogliptin is used in combination with metformin and a \nthiazolidinedione as an increased risk of hypoglycaemia has been observed with this triple therapy (see \nsection 4.4). In case of hypoglycaemia, a lower dose of the thiazolidinedione or metformin may be \nconsidered. \n \nFor patients switching from separate tablets of alogliptin and metformin (as dual therapy or as part of \ntriple therapy with insulin), both alogliptin and metformin should be dosed at the total daily dose \nalready being taken; the individual dose of alogliptin should be halved as it will be taken twice daily \nwhilst the dosing of metformin should remain unchanged. \n \nFor patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with insulin and the maximal \ntolerated dose of metformin, the dose of Vipdomet should provide alogliptin dosed at 12.5 mg twice \ndaily (25 mg total daily dose) and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. \n \nA lower dose of insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n \nMaximum daily dose \nThe maximum recommended daily dose of 25 mg alogliptin should not be exceeded. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly (\u226565 years old) \nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age. However, dosing of alogliptin should be conservative \nin patients with advanced age due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population \n \nRenal impairment \nA GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin containing medicinal \nproducts and at least annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal \nimpairment and in the elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g every \n3-6 months. \nThe maximum daily dose of metformin should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors that \nmay increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see section 4.4) should be reviewed before considering \ninitiation of metformin in patients with GFR<60 mL/min. \nIf no adequate strength of Vipdomet is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead \nof the fixed dose combination. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nGFR mL/min Metformin Alogliptin* \n\n60-89 Maximum daily dose is 3,000 mg  \nDose reduction may be considered in \nrelation to declining renal function. \n\nNo dose adjustment \nMaximum daily dose is 25 mg \n\n45-59 Maximum daily dose is 2,000 mg \nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose. \n\nMaximum daily dose is 12.5 mg \n\n30-44 Maximum daily dose is 1,000 mg. \nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose. \n\nMaximum daily dose is 12.5 mg \n\n<30 Metformin is contra-indicated Maximum daily dose is 6.25 mg \n* Alogliptin dose adjustment is based on a pharmacokinetic study where kidney function was assessed \nusing creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels estimated from the Cockcroft-Gault equation.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nVipdomet must not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Vipdomet in children and adolescents <18 years old have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use. \n \nVipdomet should be taken twice daily because of the pharmacokinetics of its metformin component. It \nshould also be taken with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with \nmetformin. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water.   \n \nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose should not be \ntaken at the same time. In that case, the missed dose should be skipped. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or \n\nhistory of a serious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic \nshock, and angioedema, to any dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.8) \n\n- Any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis) \n- Diabetic pre-coma \n- Severe renal failure (GFR <30 mL/min) \n- Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: \n\n- dehydration  \n- severe infection \n- shock \n\n- Acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia (see section 4.4) such as: \n- cardiac or respiratory failure \n- recent myocardial infarction \n- shock \n\n- Hepatic impairment (see section 4.4) \n- Acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nVipdomet should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Vipdomet is not a substitute for \ninsulin in insulin-requiring patients. \n \nLactic acidosis \n \nLactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening \nof renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute \nworsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis.  \n \nIn case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever, heat, reduced fluid intake) Vipdomet \nshould be temporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and \nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated \npatients. Other risk factors for lactic acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, \ninadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting and any conditions associated with \nhypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause lactic acidosis (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nPatients and/or care-givers should be informed on the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is \ncharacterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia \nfollowed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking Vipdomet and seek \nimmediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), \nincreased plasma lactate levels (>5 mmol/L) and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. \n \nAdministration of iodinated contrast agents \n \nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast media may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Vipdomet should be \ndiscontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable, see sections 4.2 \nand 4.5. \n \nRenal function \n \nGFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter (see section 4.2). \nMetformin is contraindicated in patients with GFR<30 mL/min and should be temporarily \ndiscontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see section 4.3). \n \nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic. Special caution should be \nexercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating \nantihypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrug (NSAID). \n \nSurgery \n \nAs Vipdomet contains metformin it must be discontinued at the time of surgery under general, spinal \nor epidural anesthesia. Therapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or \nresumption of oral nutrition and provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be \nstable.   \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nAlogliptin has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) and \nis, therefore, not recommended for use in such patients (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nUse with other antihyperglycaemic medicinal products and hypoglycaemia \n \nInsulin is known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin may be considered to \nreduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when this medicinal product is used in combination with Vipdomet \n(see section 4.2). \n \nDue to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia in combination with pioglitazone, a lower dose of \npioglitazone may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when this medicinal product is \nused in combination with Vipdomet (see section 4.2). \n \nCombinations not studied \n \nVipdomet should not be used in combination with a sulphonylurea, as the safety and efficacy of this \ncombination have not been fully established. \n \nChange in clinical status of patients with previously controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus \n \nAs Vipdomet contains metformin, any patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus previously well controlled \non Vipdomet who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly \ndefined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis. \nEvaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, \nlactate, pyruvate and metformin levels. If acidosis of either form occurs, Vipdomet must be stopped \nimmediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema and exfoliative skin \nconditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme have been observed for \nDPP-4 inhibitors and have been spontaneously reported for alogliptin in the post-marketing setting. In \nclinical studies of alogliptin, anaphylactic reactions were reported with a low incidence. \n \nAcute pancreatitis \n \nUse of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In a pooled \nanalysis of the data from 13 studies, the overall rates of pancreatitis reports in patients treated with \n25 mg alogliptin, 12.5 mg alogliptin, active control or placebo were 2, 1, 1 or 0 events per \n1,000 patient years, respectively. In the cardiovascular outcomes study the rates of pancreatitis reports \nin patients treated with alogliptin or placebo were 3 or 2 events per 1,000 patient years, respectively. \nThere have been spontaneously reported adverse reactions of acute pancreatitis in the post-marketing \nsetting. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, \nsevere abdominal pain, which may radiate to the back. If pancreatitis is suspected, Vipdomet should be \ndiscontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, Vipdomet should not be restarted. Caution should be \nexercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. \n \nHepatic effects \n \nPostmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction including hepatic failure have been received. A causal \nrelationship has not been established. Patients should be observed closely for possible liver \nabnormalities. Obtain liver function tests promptly in patients with symptoms suggestive of liver \ninjury. If an abnormality is found and an alternative etiology is not established, consider \ndiscontinuation of alogliptin treatment. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCo-administration of 100 mg alogliptin once daily and 1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily \nfor 6 days in healthy subjects had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin \nor metformin. \n \nSpecific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have not been performed with Vipdomet. The \nfollowing section outlines the interactions observed with the individual components of Vipdomet \n(alogliptin/metformin) as reported in their respective Summary of Product Characteristics. \n \nInteractions with metformin \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nAlcohol \nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in case of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment. \n \nIodinated contrast agents \nVipdomet must be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until \nat least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable, see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4. \n \nCationic medicinal products \nCationic substances that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may interact with \nmetformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted in seven \nnormal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased metformin systemic \nexposure (area under the curve, AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%. Therefore, close monitoring of \nglycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic \ntreatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular \nsecretion are co-administered. \n \nCombination requiring precautions for use \nSome medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop \ndiuretics. When starting or using such products in combination with metformin, close monitoring of \nrenal function is necessary. \n \nMedicinal products with intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity \nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes), beta-2-agonists and diuretics (see also \nsection 4.4) have intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent \nblood glucose monitoring performed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal \nproducts. If necessary, the dose of Vipdomet should be adjusted during therapy with the other \nmedicinal product and upon its discontinuation. \n \nACE inhibitors \nACE inhibitors may decrease blood glucose levels. If necessary, the dose of Vipdomet should be \nadjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and upon its discontinuation. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on alogliptin \n \nAlogliptin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and metabolism by the cytochrome (CYP) \nP450 enzyme system is negligible (see section 5.2). Interactions with CYP inhibitors are thus not \nexpected and have not been shown.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nResults from clinical interaction studies also demonstrate that there are no clinically relevant effects of \ngemfibrozil (a CYP2C8/9 inhibitor), fluconazole (a CYP2C9 inhibitor), ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 \ninhibitor), cyclosporine (a p-glycoprotein inhibitor), voglibose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor), \ndigoxin, metformin, cimetidine, pioglitazone or atorvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin. \n \nEffects of alogliptin on other medicinal products \n \nIn vitro studies suggest that alogliptin does not inhibit nor induce CYP 450 isoforms at concentrations \nachieved with the recommended dose of 25 mg alogliptin (see section 5.2). Interaction with substrates \nof CYP 450 isoforms are thus not expected and have not been shown. In studies in vitro, alogliptin \nwas found to be neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of key transporters associated with disposition of \nthe active substance in the kidney: organic anion transporter-1, organic anion transporter-3 or organic \ncationic transporter-2 (OCT2). Furthermore, clinical data do not suggest interaction with \np-glycoprotein inhibitors or substrates. \n \nIn clinical studies, alogliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, \n(R)-warfarin, pioglitazone, glyburide, tolbutamide, (S)-warfarin, dextromethorphan, atorvastatin, \nmidazolam, an oral contraceptive (norethindrone and ethinyl oestradiol), digoxin, fexofenadine, \nmetformin, or cimetidine, thus providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity to cause interaction with \nsubstrates of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, p-glycoprotein, and OCT2. \n \nIn healthy subjects, alogliptin had no effect on prothrombin time or International Normalised Ratio \n(INR) when administered concomitantly with warfarin.  \n \nCombination of alogliptin with other anti-diabetic medicinal products \n \nResults from studies with metformin, pioglitazone (thiazolidinedione), voglibose (alpha-glucosidase \ninhibitor) and glyburide (sulphonylurea) have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic \ninteractions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of Vipdomet in pregnant women. Studies in pregnant rats with \nalogliptin plus metformin as combination treatment have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) \nat approximately 5-20 times (for metformin and alogliptin respectively) the human exposure at the \nrecommended dose.  \n \nVipdomet should not be used during pregnancy.  \n \nRisk related to alogliptin \nThere are no data from the use of alogliptin in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nRisk related to metformin  \nA limited amount of data from the use of metformin in pregnant women does not indicate an increased \nrisk of congenital abnormalities. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with \nrespect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant doses (see section 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNo studies in lactating animals have been conducted with the combined active substances of \nVipdomet. In studies performed with the individual active substances, both alogliptin and metformin \nwere excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is unknown whether alogliptin is excreted in human milk. \nMetformin is excreted in human milk in small amounts. A risk to the suckling child cannot be \nexcluded. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nVipdomet therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of Vipdomet on fertility in humans has not been studied. No adverse effects on fertility \nwere observed in animal studies conducted with alogliptin or with metformin (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVipdomet has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, patients \nshould be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia especially when used in combination with insulin or \npioglitazone. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAcute pancreatitis is a serious adverse reaction and is attributed to the alogliptin component of \nVipdomet (see section 4.4). Hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, \nanaphylactic reactions, and angioedema are serious and are attributed to the alogliptin component of \nVipdomet (see section 4.4). Lactic acidosis is a serious adverse reaction, which may occur very rarely \n(<1/10,000), and is attributed to the metformin component of Vipdomet (see section 4.4). Other \nreactions such as upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, gastroenteritis, \nabdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, pruritus, rash, \nhypoglycaemia may occur commonly (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) (see section 4.4) which are attributed to \nVipdomet. \n \nClinical studies conducted to support the efficacy and safety of Vipdomet involved the \nco-administration of alogliptin and metformin as separate tablets. However, the results of \nbioequivalence studies have demonstrated that Vipdomet film-coated tablets are bioequivalent to the \ncorresponding doses of alogliptin and metformin co-administered as separate tablets. \n \nThe information provided is based on a total of 7,150 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including \n4,201 patients treated with alogliptin and metformin, who participated in 7 phase 3 double-blind, \nplacebo- or active-controlled clinical studies. These studies evaluated the effects of co-administered \nalogliptin and metformin on glycaemic control and their safety as initial combination therapy, as dual \ntherapy in patients initially treated with metformin alone, and as add-on therapy to a thiazolidinedione \nor insulin. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n \n\nSystem organ class \nAdverse reaction \n\nFrequency of adverse reactions \n\n Alogliptin Metformin Vipdomet \nInfections and infestations    \nupper respiratory tract infections common  common \nnasopharyngitis common  common \nImmune system disorders    \nhypersensitivity not known   \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders    \nlactic acidosis  very rare  \nvitamin B12 deficiency  very rare  \nhypoglycaemia common  common \nNervous system disorders    \nheadache common  common \nmetallic taste  common  \nGastrointestinal disorders    \ngastroenteritis   common \nabdominal pain common very common common \ndiarrhoea common very common common \nvomiting  very common common \ngastritis   common \ngastroesophageal reflux disease common  common \nloss of appetite  very common  \nnausea  very common  \nacute pancreatitis not known   \nHepatobiliary disorders    \nhepatitis  very rare  \nLiver function test abnormalities  very rare  \nhepatic dysfunction including hepatic failure not known   \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders    \npruritus common very rare common \nrash common  common \nerythema  very rare  \nexfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome \n\nnot known   \n\nerythema multiforme not known   \nangioedema not known   \nurticaria not known very rare  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nLactic acidosis: 0.03 cases/1,000 patient-years (see section 4.4). \n \nLong-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption \nand appears generally to be without clinical significance. However, it may very rarely result in \nclinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g. megaloblastic anaemia). \n \nGastrointestinal symptoms occur most frequently during initiation of therapy and resolve \nspontaneously in most cases. These may be prevented by taking metformin in 2 daily doses during or \nafter meals. \n \nIsolated cases of hepatitis or liver function test abnormalities resolving on discontinuation of \nmetformin have been reported. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo data are available with regard to overdose of Vipdomet.   \n \nAlogliptin \n \nThe highest doses of alogliptin administered in clinical studies were single doses of 800 mg to healthy \nsubjects and doses of 400 mg once daily for 14 days to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \n(equivalent to 32 times and 16 times the recommended total daily dose of 25 mg alogliptin, \nrespectively).  \n \nMetformin \n \nA large overdose of metformin or concomitant risks may lead to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a \nmedical emergency and must be treated in hospital.  \n \nManagement \n \nIn the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive measures should be employed as dictated by the \npatient\u2019s clinical status. \n \nMinimal quantities of alogliptin are removed by haemodialysis (approximately 7% of the substance \nwas removed during a 3 hour haemodialysis session). Therefore, haemodialysis is of little clinical \nbenefit in removing alogliptin in overdose. It is not known if alogliptin is removed by peritoneal \ndialysis.  \n \nThe most effective method of removing lactate and metformin is haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes; combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs. \n \nATC code: A10BD13. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nVipdomet combines two antihyperglycaemic medicinal products with complementary and distinct \nmechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: \nalogliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin, a member of the biguanide \nclass.   \n \nAlogliptin \nAlogliptin is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of DPP-4, >10,000-fold more selective for DPP-4 \nthan other related enzymes including DPP-8 and DPP-9. DPP-4 is the principal enzyme involved in \nthe rapid degradation of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP \n(glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), which are released by the intestine and levels are \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nincreased in response to a meal. GLP-1 and GIP increases insulin biosynthesis and secretion from \npancreatic beta cells, while GLP-1 also inhibits glucagon secretion and hepatic glucose production. \nAlogliptin therefore improves glycaemic control via a glucose-dependent mechanism, whereby insulin \nrelease is enhanced and glucagon levels are suppressed when glucose levels are high. \n \nMetformin \nMetformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial \nplasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and, therefore, does not produce \nhypoglycaemia.  \n \nMetformin may act via 3 mechanisms: \n \n- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.  \n- in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and \n\nutilisation.  \n- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption.  \n \nMetformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. It also \nincreases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and \nGLUT-4).  \n \nIn humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid \nmetabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term \nclinical studies; metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nClinical studies conducted to support the efficacy of Vipdomet involved the co-administration of \nalogliptin and metformin as separate tablets. However, the results of bioequivalence studies have \ndemonstrated that Vipdomet film-coated tablets are bioequivalent to the corresponding doses of \nalogliptin and metformin co-administered as separate tablets. \n \nThe co-administration of alogliptin and metformin has been studied as dual therapy in patients initially \ntreated with metformin alone, and as add-on therapy to a thiazolidinedione or insulin. \n \nAdministration of 25 mg alogliptin to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus produced peak inhibition \nof DPP-4 within 1 to 2 hours and exceeded 93% both after a single 25 mg dose and after 14 days of \nonce-daily dosing. Inhibition of DPP-4 remained above 81% at 24 hours after 14 days of dosing. \nWhen the 4-hour postprandial glucose concentrations were averaged across breakfast, lunch and \ndinner, 14 days of treatment with 25 mg alogliptin resulted in a mean placebo-corrected reduction \nfrom baseline of -35.2 mg/dL. \n \nBoth 25 mg alogliptin alone and in combination with 30 mg pioglitazone demonstrated significant \ndecreases in postprandial glucose and postprandial glucagon whilst significantly increasing \npostprandial active GLP-1 levels at Week 16 compared to placebo (p<0.05). In addition, 25 mg \nalogliptin alone and in combination with 30 mg pioglitazone produced statistically significant \n(p<0.001) reductions in total triglycerides at Week 16 as measured by postprandial incremental \nAUC(0-8) change from baseline compared to placebo. \n \nA total of 7,151 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 4,202 patients treated with alogliptin \nand metformin, participated in 7 phase 3 double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical studies \nconducted to evaluate the effects of co-administered alogliptin and metformin on glycaemic control \nand their safety. In these studies, 696 alogliptin/metformin-treated patients were \u2265 65 years old. \n \nOverall, treatment with the recommended total daily dose of 25 mg alogliptin in combination with \nmetformin improved glycaemic control. This was determined by clinically relevant and statistically \nsignificant reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose compared to \n\n\n\n13 \n\ncontrol from baseline to study endpoint. Reductions in HbA1c were similar across different subgroups \nincluding renal impairment, age, gender and body mass index, while differences between races (e.g. \nWhite and non-White) were small. Clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c compared to control \nwere also observed regardless of baseline background treatment. Higher baseline HbA1c was \nassociated with a greater reduction in HbA1c. Generally, the effects of alogliptin on body weight and \nlipids were neutral. \n \nAlogliptin as add-on therapy to metformin \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to metformin hydrochloride therapy (mean \ndose = 1,847 mg) resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in HbA1c and \nfasting plasma glucose at Week 26 when compared to the addition of placebo (Table 2). Significantly \nmore patients receiving 25 mg alogliptin (44.4%) achieved target HbA1c levels of \u22647.0% compared to \nthose receiving placebo (18.3%) at Week 26 (p<0.001).   \n \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to metformin hydrochloride therapy (mean \ndose = 1,835 mg) resulted in improvements from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 and Week 104. At \nWeek 52, the HbA1c reduction by 25 mg alogliptin plus metformin (-0.76%, Table 3) was similar to \nthat produced by glipizide (mean dose = 5.2 mg) plus metformin hydrochloride therapy (mean \ndose = 1,824 mg, -0.73%). At Week 104, the HbA1c reduction by 25 mg alogliptin plus metformin \n(-0.72%, Table 3) was greater than that produced by glipizide plus metformin (-0.59%). Mean change \nfrom baseline in fasting plasma glucose at Week 52 for 25 mg alogliptin and metformin was \nsignificantly greater than that for glipizide and metformin (p<0.001). By Week 104, mean change \nfrom baseline in fasting plasma glucose for 25 mg alogliptin and metformin was -3.2 mg/dL compared \nwith 5.4 mg/dL for glipizide and metformin. More patients receiving 25 mg alogliptin and metformin \n(48.5%) achieved target HbA1c levels of \u22647.0% compared to those receiving glipizide and metformin \n(42.8%) (p=0.004). \n \nCo-administration of 12.5 mg alogliptin and 1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily resulted in \nstatistically significant improvements from baseline in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose at Week 26 \nwhen compared to either 12.5 mg alogliptin twice daily alone or 1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride \ntwice daily alone. Significantly more patients receiving 12.5 mg alogliptin and 1.000 mg metformin \nhydrochloride twice daily (59.5%) achieved target HbA1c levels of < 7.0% compared to those \nreceiving either 12.5 mg alogliptin twice daily alone (20.2%, p<0.001) or 1,000 mg metformin \nhydrochloride twice daily alone (34.3%, p<0.001) at Week 26.  \n \nAlogliptin as add-on therapy to metformin with a thiazolidinedione \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to pioglitazone therapy (mean dose = 35.0 mg, with or \nwithout metformin or a sulphonylurea) resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline \nin HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose at Week 26 when compared to the addition of placebo (Table 2). \nClinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c compared to placebo were also observed with 25 mg \nalogliptin regardless of whether patients were receiving concomitant metformin or sulphonylurea \ntherapy. Significantly more patients receiving 25 mg alogliptin (49.2%) achieved target HbA1c levels \nof \u22647.0% compared to those receiving placebo (34.0%) at Week 26 (p=0.004).  \n \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to 30 mg pioglitazone in combination with metformin \nhydrochloride therapy (mean dose = 1,867.9 mg) resulted in improvements from baseline in HbA1c at \nWeek 52 that were both non-inferior and statistically superior to those produced by 45 mg \npioglitazone in combination with metformin hydrochloride therapy (mean dose = 1,847.6 mg, \nTable 3). The significant reductions in HbA1c observed with 25 mg alogliptin plus 30 mg pioglitazone \nand metformin were consistent over the entire 52-week treatment period compared to 45 mg \npioglitazone and metformin (p<0.001 at all time points). In addition, mean change from baseline in \nFPG at Week 52 for 25 mg alogliptin plus 30 mg pioglitazone and metformin was significantly greater \nthan that for 45 mg pioglitazone and metformin (p<0.001). Significantly more patients receiving \n25 mg alogliptin plus 30 mg pioglitazone and metformin (33.2%) achieved target HbA1c levels of \n\u22647.0% compared to those receiving 45 mg pioglitazone and metformin (21.3%) at Week 52 (p<0.001).  \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nAlogliptin as add-on therapy to metformin with insulin \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to insulin therapy (mean dose = 56.5 IU, with or without \nmetformin) resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in HbA1c and FPG at \nWeek 26 when compared to the addition of placebo (Table 2). Clinically meaningful reductions in \nHbA1c compared to placebo were also observed with 25 mg alogliptin regardless of whether patients \nwere receiving concomitant metformin therapy. More patients receiving 25 mg alogliptin (7.8%) \nachieved target HbA1c levels of \u22647.0% compared to those receiving placebo (0.8%) at Week 26.  \n \n\nTable 2: Change in HbA1c (%) from baseline with alogliptin 25 mg at Week 26  \nby placebo-controlled study (FAS, LOCF) \n\nStudy Mean baseline \nHbA1c (%) (SD) \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in HbA1c \n\n(%)\u2020 (SE) \n\nPlacebo-corrected \nchange from baseline \n\nin HbA1c (%)\u2020 \n(2-sided 95% CI) \n\nAdd-on combination therapy placebo-controlled studies \nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with \nmetformin \n(n=203) \n\n7.93 \n(0.799) \n\n-0.59 \n(0.054) \n\n-0.48* \n(-0.67, -0.30) \n\nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with a \nsulphonylurea \n(n=197) \n\n8.09 \n(0.898) \n\n-0.52 \n(0.058) \n\n-0.53* \n(-0.73, -0.33) \n\nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with a \nthiazolidinedione \u00b1 \nmetformin or a \nsulphonylurea \n(n=195) \n\n8.01 \n(0.837) \n\n-0.80 \n(0.056) \n\n-0.61* \n(-0.80, -0.41) \n\nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with \ninsulin + metformin \n(n=126) \n\n9.27 \n(1.127) \n\n-0.71 \n(0.078) \n\n-0.59* \n(-0.80, -0.37) \n\nFAS = full analysis set \nLOCF = last observation carried forward \n\u2020 Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycaemic therapy status and baseline values \n* p<0.001 compared to placebo or placebo+combination treatment \n \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTable 3: Change in HbA1c (%) from baseline with alogliptin 25 mg \nby active-controlled study (PPS, LOCF) \n\nStudy Mean baseline \nHbA1c (%) (SD) \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in HbA1c \n\n(%)\u2020 (SE) \n\nTreatment-corrected \nchange from baseline \n\nin HbA1c (%)\u2020 \n(1-sided CI) \n\nAdd-on combination therapy studies \nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with \nmetformin vs a \nsulphonylurea + \nmetformin \n \nChange at Week 52 \n(n=382) \n \nChange at \nWeek 104  \n(n=382) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7.61 \n(0.526) \n\n \n \n\n7.61 \n(0.526) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-0.76 \n(0.027) \n\n \n \n\n-0.72 \n(0.037) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-0.03 \n(-infinity, 0.059) \n\n \n \n\n-0.13* \n(-infinity, -0.006) \n\nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with a \nthiazolidinedione + \nmetformin vs a \ntitrating \nthiazolidinedione + \nmetformin \n \nChange at Week 26 \n(n=303) \n \nChange at Week 52 \n(n=303) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n8.25 \n(0.820) \n\n \n8.25 \n\n(0.820) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-0.89 \n(0.042) \n\n \n-0.70 \n\n(0.048) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-0.47* \n(-infinity, -0.35) \n\n \n-0.42* \n\n(-infinity, -0.28) \n\nPPS = per protocol set \nLOCF = last observation carried forward \n*Non inferiority and superiority statistically demonstrated \n\u2020 Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycaemic therapy status and baseline values \n \n \nElderly (\u226565 years old) \nThe efficacy and safety of the recommended doses of alogliptin and metformin in a subgroup of \npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \u226565 years old were reviewed and found to be consistent with \nthe profile obtained in patients <65 years old. \n \nClinical safety \n \nCardiovascular Safety \nIn a pooled analysis of the data from 13 studies, the overall incidences of cardiovascular death, non \nfatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke were comparable in patients treated with 25 mg \nalogliptin, active control or placebo. \n \nIn addition, a prospective randomised cardiovascular outcomes safety study was conducted with \n5,380 patients with high underlying cardiovascular risk to examine the effect of alogliptin compared \nwith placebo (when added to standard of care) on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) \nincluding time to the first occurrence of any event in the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke in patients with a recent (15 to 90 days) acute coronary \n\n\n\n16 \n\nevent. At baseline, patients had a mean age of 61 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.2 years, and \nmean HbA1c of 8.0%. \n \nThe study demonstrated that alogliptin did not increase the risk of having a MACE compared to \nplacebo [Hazard Ratio: 0.96; 1-sided 99% Confidence Interval: 0-1.16]. In the alogliptin group, 11.3% \nof patients experienced a MACE compared to 11.8% of patients in the placebo group.  \n \n\nTable 4.

In the alogliptin group, 12.7% (344 subjects) experienced an \nevent within the secondary MACE composite endpoint, compared with 13.4% (359 subjects) in the \nplacebo group [Hazard Ratio = 0.95; 1-sided 99% Confidence Interval: 0-1.14]. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nIn a pooled analysis of the data from 12 studies, the overall incidence of any episode of \nhypoglycaemia was lower in patients treated with 25 mg alogliptin than in patients treated with \n12.5 mg alogliptin, active control or placebo (3.6%, 4.6%, 12.9% and 6.2%, respectively). The \nmajority of these episodes were mild to moderate in intensity. The overall incidence of episodes of \nsevere hypoglycaemia was comparable in patients treated with 25 mg alogliptin or 12.5 mg alogliptin, \nand lower than the incidence in patients treated with active control or placebo (0.1%, 0.1%, 0.4% and \n0.4%, respectively). In the prospective randomised controlled cardiovascular outcomes study, \ninvestigator reported events of hypoglycemia were similar in patients receiving placebo (6.5%) and \npatients receiving alogliptin (6.7%) in addition to standard of care. \n \nIn a clinical trial of alogliptin as mono-therapy, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar to that of \nplacebo, and lower than placebo in another trial as add-on to a sulphonylurea.  \n \nHigher rates of hypoglycaemia were observed with triple therapy with a thiazolidinedione and \nmetformin and in combination with insulin, as observed with other DPP-4 inhibitors.  \n \nPatients (\u226565 years old) with type 2 diabetes mellitus are considered more susceptible to episodes of \nhypoglycaemia than patients <65 years old. In a pooled analysis of the data from 12 studies, the \noverall incidence of any episode of hypoglycaemia was similar in patients \u226565 years old treated with \n25 mg alogliptin (3.8%) to that in patients <65 years old (3.6%). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nVipdomet in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that Vipdomet film-coated \ntablets are bioequivalent to the corresponding doses of alogliptin and metformin co-administered as \nseparate tablets. \n \nCo-administration of 100 mg alogliptin once daily and 1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily \nfor 6 days in healthy subjects had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin \nor metformin. \n \nAdministration of Vipdomet with food resulted in no change in total exposure (AUC) to alogliptin or \nmetformin. However, mean peak plasma concentrations of alogliptin and metformin were decreased \nby 13% and 28% when Vipdomet was administered with food, respectively. There was no change in \nthe time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) for alogliptin, but there was a delayed Tmax for metformin \nof 1.5 hours. These changes are not likely to be clinically significant (see below). \n \nVipdomet should be taken twice daily because of the pharmacokinetics of its metformin component. It \nshould also be taken with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal undesirable effects associated with \nmetformin (see section 4.2). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of Vipdomet in children and adolescents <18 years old has not been established. \nNo data are available (see section 4.2). \n \nThe following section outlines the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual components of \nVipdomet (alogliptin/metformin) as reported in their respective Summary of Product Characteristics. \n \nAlogliptin \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of alogliptin has been shown to be similar in healthy subjects and in patients \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus. \n \nAbsorption \nThe absolute bioavailability of alogliptin is approximately 100%.   \n \nAdministration with a high-fat meal resulted in no change in total and peak exposure to alogliptin. \nAlogliptin may, therefore, be administered with or without food.  \n \nAfter administration of single oral doses of up to 800 mg in healthy subjects, alogliptin was rapidly \nabsorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring 1 to 2 hours (median Tmax) after dosing. \n \nNo clinically relevant accumulation after multiple dosing was observed in either healthy subjects or in \npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  \n \nTotal and peak exposure to alogliptin increased proportionately across single doses of 6.25 mg up to \n100 mg alogliptin (covering the therapeutic dose range). The inter-subject coefficient of variation for \nalogliptin AUC was small (17%).   \n \nDistribution \nFollowing a single intravenous dose of 12.5 mg alogliptin to healthy subjects, the volume of \ndistribution during the terminal phase was 417 L indicating that the active substance is well distributed \ninto tissues.  \n \nAlogliptin is 20-30% bound to plasma proteins. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nBiotransformation \nAlogliptin does not undergo extensive metabolism, 60-70% of the dose is excreted as unchanged \nactive substance in the urine.  \n \nTwo minor metabolites were detected following administration of an oral dose of [14C] alogliptin, \nN-demethylated alogliptin, M-I (< 1% of the parent compound), and N-acetylated alogliptin, \nM-II (< 6% of the parent compound). M-I is an active metabolite and is a highly selective inhibitor of \nDPP-4 similar to alogliptin; M-II does not display any inhibitory activity towards DPP-4 or other \nDPP-related enzymes. In vitro data indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 contribute to the limited \nmetabolism of alogliptin.  \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that alogliptin does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 and does not \ninhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 at concentrations \nachieved with the recommended dose of 25 mg alogliptin. Studies in vitro have shown alogliptin to be \na mild inducer of CYP3A4, but alogliptin has not been shown to induce CYP3A4 in studies in vivo.  \n \nIn studies in vitro, alogliptin was not an inhibitor of the following renal transporters; OAT1, OAT3 \nand OCT2. \n \nAlogliptin exists predominantly as the (R)-enantiomer (>99%) and undergoes little or no chiral \nconversion in vivo to the (S)-enantiomer. The (S)-enantiomer is not detectable at therapeutic doses.  \n \nElimination \nAlogliptin was eliminated with a mean terminal half-life (T1/2) of approximately 21 hours.  \n \nFollowing administration of an oral dose of [14C] alogliptin, 76% of total radioactivity was eliminated \nin the urine and 13% was recovered in the faeces.  \n \nThe average renal clearance of alogliptin (170 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (approx. 120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. \n \nTime-dependency \nTotal exposure (AUC(0-inf)) to alogliptin following administration of a single dose was similar to \nexposure during one dose interval (AUC(0-24)) after 6 days of once daily dosing. This indicates no \ntime-dependency in the kinetics of alogliptin after multiple dosing. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nA single dose of 50 mg alogliptin was administered to 4 groups of patients with varying degrees of \nrenal impairment (CrCl using the Cockcroft-Gault formula): mild (CrCl = >50 to \u226480 mL/min), \nmoderate (CrCl = \u226530 to \u226450 mL/min), severe (CrCl = <30 mL/min) and end-stage renal disease on \nhaemodialysis.  \n \nAn approximate 1.7-fold increase in AUC for alogliptin was observed in patients with mild renal \nimpairment. However, as the distribution of AUC values for alogliptin in these patients was within the \nsame range as control subjects, no dose adjustment of alogliptin for patients with mild renal \nimpairment is necessary (see section 4.2).  \n \nIn patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis, an \nincrease in systemic exposure to alogliptin of approximately 2- and 4-fold was observed, respectively. \n(Patients with end-stage renal disease underwent haemodialysis immediately after alogliptin dosing. \nBased on mean dialysate concentrations, approximately 7% of the active substance was removed \nduring a 3-hour haemodialysis session.) Therefore, in order to maintain systemic exposures to \nalogliptin that are similar to those observed in patients with normal renal function, lower doses of \nalogliptin should be used in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal \ndisease requiring dialysis (see above and section 4.2).  \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nHepatic impairment \nTotal exposure to alogliptin was approximately 10% lower and peak exposure was approximately \n8% lower in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to control subjects. The magnitude \nof these reductions was not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, no dose adjustment of \nalogliptin is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh scores \nof 5 to 9). Alogliptin has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nscore >9). \n \nAge, gender, race, body weight \nAge (65-81 years old), gender, race (white, black and Asian) and body weight did not have any \nclinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin. No dose adjustment is necessary (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of alogliptin in children and adolescents <18 years old has not been established. \nNo data are available (see section 4.2 and above). \n \nMetformin \n \nAbsorption \nAfter an oral dose of metformin, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is reached in \napproximately 2.5 hours (Tmax). Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg or 850 mg metformin \nhydrochloride tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects. After an oral dose, the \nnon-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. \n \nAfter oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the \npharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear.  \n \nAt the recommended metformin doses and dosing schedules, steady-state plasma concentrations of \nmetformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally less than 1 microgram/mL. In \ncontrolled clinical studies, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed 4 microgram/mL \neven at maximum doses.  \n \nFood slightly delays and decreases the extent of the absorption of metformin. Following oral \nadministration of an 850 mg metformin hydrochloride tablet, the peak plasma concentration was \n40% lower, AUC was decreased by 25% and the time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) was \nprolonged by 35 minutes. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.  \n \nDistribution \nPlasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes. The blood peak is lower \nthan the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells most likely \nrepresent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) ranged \nbetween 63-276 L.  \n \nBiotransformation \nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans.  \n \nElimination \nRenal clearance of metformin is >400 mL/min indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular \nfiltration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is \napproximately 6.5 hours.  \n \nWhen renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and, \nthus, the elimination half-life is prolonged leading to increased levels of metformin in the plasma.  \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nVipdomet \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nDue to its metformin component, Vipdomet should not be used in patients with severe renal \nimpairment, or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nVipdomet should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nConcomitant treatment with alogliptin and metformin did not produce new toxicities and no effects on \nthe toxicokinetics of either compound were observed. \n \nIn rats no treatment-related foetal abnormalities occurred following concomitant administration at \nexposure margins of approximately 28- to 29-fold for alogliptin and 2- to 2.5-fold for metformin at the \nmaximum recommended human dose of 25 mg/day and 2,000 mg/day, respectively. The combination \nrevealed teratogenic potential in small numbers of foetuses (microphthalmia, small eye bulge and cleft \npalate) at higher doses of metformin (exposure margins of approximately 20-fold and 5- to 6-fold the \nmaximum recommended human dose for alogliptin and metformin, respectively). \n \nThe following data are findings from studies performed with alogliptin or metformin individually. \n \nAlogliptin \n \nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and toxicology. \n \nThe no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs \nup to 26- and 39-weeks in duration, respectively, produced exposure margins that were approximately \n147- and 227-fold, respectively, the exposure in humans at the recommended total daily dose of 25 mg \nalogliptin. \n \nAlogliptin was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. \n \nAlogliptin was not carcinogenic in 2-year carcinogenicity studies conducted in rats and mice. Minimal \nto mild simple transitional cell hyperplasia was seen in the urinary bladder of male rats at the lowest \ndose used (27 times the human exposure) without establishment of a clear NOEL (no observed effect \nlevel). \n \nNo adverse effects of alogliptin were observed upon fertility, reproductive performance, or early \nembryonic development in rats up to a systemic exposure far above the human exposure at the \nrecommended dose. Although fertility was not affected, a slight, statistical increase in the number of \nabnormal sperm was observed in males at an exposure far above the human exposure at the \nrecommended dose.  \n \nPlacental transfer of alogliptin occurs in rats. \n \nAlogliptin was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits with a systemic exposure at the NOAELs far above the \nhuman exposure at the recommended dose. Higher doses of alogliptin were not teratogenic but \nresulted in maternal toxicity, and were associated with delayed and/or lack of ossification of bones and \ndecreased foetal body weights. \n \nIn a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, exposures far above the human exposure at the \nrecommended dose did not harm the developing embryo or affect offspring growth and development. \n\n\n\n21 \n\nHigher doses of alogliptin decreased offspring body weight and exerted some developmental effects \nconsidered secondary to the low body weight. \n \nStudies in lactating rats indicate that alogliptin is excreted in milk. \n \nNo alogliptin-related effects were observed in juvenile rats following repeat-dose administration for \n4 and 8 weeks. \n \nMetformin \n \nPreclinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to \nreproduction. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Vipdomet is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Vipdomet \n3. How to take Vipdomet \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Vipdomet \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vipdomet is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Vipdomet is \nVipdomet contains two different medicines called alogliptin and metformin in one tablet: \n \n- alogliptin belongs to a group of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 \n\ninhibitors). Alogliptin works to increase the levels of insulin in the body after a meal and \ndecrease the amount of sugar in the body.  \n\n- metformin belongs to a group of medicines called biguanides which also help to lower blood \nsugar by lowering the amount of sugar made in the liver and helping insulin to work more \neffectively. \n\n \nBoth of these groups of medicines are \u201coral anti-diabetics\u201d. \n \nWhat Vipdomet is used for \nVipdomet is used to lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is also \ncalled non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM. \n \nVipdomet is taken when your blood sugar cannot be adequately controlled by diet, exercise and other \nanti-diabetic medicines such as metformin alone; insulin alone; or metformin and pioglitazone taken \ntogether.  \n \nIf you are already taking both alogliptin and metformin as single tablets, Vipdomet can replace them in \none tablet. \n \nIt is important that you continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise that your nurse or doctor has \ngiven you. \n \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Vipdomet \n \nDo not take Vipdomet: \n- if you are allergic to alogliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n- if you have had a serious allergic reaction to any other similar medicines that you take to control \n\nyour blood sugar. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include; rash, raised red patches \non your skin (hives), swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in \nbreathing or swallowing. Additional symptoms may include general itching and feeling of heat \nespecially affecting the scalp, mouth, throat, palms of hands and soles of feet (Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome). \n\n- if you have -severely reduced kidney function \n- if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood \n\nglucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactate acidosis (see \u201cRisk of lactic \nacidosis\u201d below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called 'ketone \nbodies' accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include \nstomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity \nsmell.  \n\n- if you have a severe infection or are seriously dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your \nbody) \n\n- if you recently had a heart attack or have severe circulatory problems including shock \n- if you have severe breathing difficulties  \n- if you have liver disease \n- if you drink alcohol excessively (either every day or in large quantities only from time to time) \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vipdomet : \n- if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce insulin). \n- if you are taking Vipdomet with insulin or a thiazolidinedione. Your doctor may want to reduce \n\nyour dose of insulin or a thiazolidinedione when you take it together with Vipdomet in order to \navoid too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). \n\n- if you are taking another medicine for diabetes that contains a \u201csulphonylurea\u201d, you should not \nstart taking Vipdomet. \n\n- if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas. \n- in case of symptoms suggestive of liver injury during Vipdomet therapy. \n \nRisk of lactic acidosis \nVipdomet may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your \nkidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with \nuncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further \ninformation below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a \nreduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). If any of the above apply to you, talk to \nyour doctor for further instructions. \n \nStop taking Vipdomet for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with \ndehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to \nheat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions. \n \nStop taking Vipdomet and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience \nsome of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. \nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. If lactic acidosis is suspected, \nseek medical attention from a doctor or a hospital. \nSymptoms of lactic acidosis include: \n- vomiting \n- stomach ache (abdominal pain) \n- muscle cramps \n- a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness \n\n\n\n46 \n\n- difficulty in breathing \n- reduced body temperature and heartbeat. \n \nIf you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Vipdomet during and for some time before \nand after the procedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your \ntreatment with Vipdomet. \n \nDuring treatment with Vipdomet, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or \nmore frequently if you are elderly and/or if have worsening kidney function \n \nChildren and adolescents \nVipdomet is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data in \nthese patients.  \n \nOther medicines and Vipdomet \nIf you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \nexample in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Vipdomet before or at the time of the \ninjection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nVipdomet. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. You may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may \nneed to adjust the dosage of Vipdomet. It is especially important to mention the following: \n- hydrocortisone and prednisolone (corticosteroids), used to treat diseases that involve \n\ninflammation like asthma and arthritis  \n- cimetidine, used to treat stomach problems \n- bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists), used to treat asthma \n- medicines which increase urine production (diuretics)  \n- medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, such as \n\nibuprofen and celecoxib),  \n- certain medicines used for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors  and \n\nangiotensin II receptor antagonists)  \n- medicines containing alcohol. \n \nVipdomet with alcohol \nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Vipdomet since this may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis - see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You should not use Vipdomet if you \nare pregnant. \n \nVipdomet is not recommended during breast-feeding since metformin passes into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVipdomet is not known to affect your ability to drive and use machines. Taking Vipdomet in \ncombination with medicines called pioglitazone or insulin can cause too low blood sugar levels \n(hypoglycaemia), which may affect your ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n \n3. How to take Vipdomet \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nYour doctor will tell you exactly how much Vipdomet you need to take. The amount of Vipdomet will \nvary depending on your condition and the doses you currently take of metformin alone, metformin in \ncombination with pioglitazone, insulin and/or individual tablets of alogliptin and metformin.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet twice a day. If you have reduced kidney function, your doctor \nmay prescribe a lower dose, which may need to be given as separate tablets of alogliptin and \nmetformin. \n \nSwallow your tablet(s) whole with water. You should take this medicine with food to reduce your \nchance of an upset stomach. \n \nIf you take more Vipdomet than you should \nIf you take more tablets than you should, or if someone else or a child takes your medicine, contact or \ngo to your nearest emergency centre straight away. Take this leaflet or some tablets with you so that \nyour doctor knows exactly what you have taken.  \n \nIf you forget to take Vipdomet \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. Do not take a double dose to make up \nfor a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Vipdomet \nDo not stop taking Vipdomet without consulting your doctor first. Your blood sugar levels may \nincrease when you stop taking Vipdomet. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what vipdomet is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what vipdomet is vipdomet contains two different medicines called alogliptin and metformin in one tablet: - alogliptin belongs to a group of medicines called dpp-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors). alogliptin works to increase the levels of insulin in the body after a meal and decrease the amount of sugar in the body. - metformin belongs to a group of medicines called biguanides which also help to lower blood sugar by lowering the amount of sugar made in the liver and helping insulin to work more effectively. both of these groups of medicines are \"oral anti-diabetics\". what vipdomet is used for vipdomet is used to lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. type 2 diabetes is also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or niddm. vipdomet is taken when your blood sugar cannot be adequately controlled by diet, exercise and other anti-diabetic medicines such as metformin alone; insulin alone; or metformin and pioglitazone taken together. if you are already taking both alogliptin and metformin as single tablets, vipdomet can replace them in one tablet. it is important that you continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise that your nurse or doctor has given you.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "vipdomet", "Type":

allergic to alogliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) - if you have had a serious allergic reaction to any other similar medicines that you take to control your blood sugar. symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include; rash, raised red patches on your skin (hives), swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing. additional symptoms may include general itching and feeling of heat especially affecting the scalp, mouth, throat, palms of hands and soles of feet (stevens-johnson syndrome). - if you have -severely reduced kidney function - if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactate acidosis (see \"risk of lactic acidosis\" below) or ketoacidosis. ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called 'ketone bodies' accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. symptoms include stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or your breath developing an unusual fruity smell. - if you have a severe infection or are seriously dehydrated (have lost a lot of water from your body) - if you recently had a heart attack or have severe circulatory problems including shock - if you have severe breathing difficulties - if you have liver disease - if you drink alcohol excessively (either every day or in large quantities only from time to time) warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking vipdomet : - if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce insulin). - if you are taking vipdomet with insulin or a thiazolidinedione. your doctor may want to reduce your dose of insulin or a thiazolidinedione when you take it together with vipdomet in order to avoid too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). - if you are taking another medicine for diabetes that contains a \"sulphonylurea\", you should not start taking vipdomet. - if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas. - in case of symptoms suggestive of liver injury during vipdomet therapy. risk of lactic acidosis vipdomet may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. the risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. stop taking vipdomet for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with dehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to heat or if you drink less fluid than normal. talk to your doctor for further instructions. stop taking vipdomet and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. if lactic acidosis is suspected, seek medical attention from a doctor or a hospital. symptoms of lactic acidosis include: - vomiting - stomach ache (abdominal pain) - muscle cramps - a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness 46 - difficulty in breathing - reduced body temperature and heartbeat. if you need to have major surgery you must stop taking vipdomet during and for some time before and after the procedure. your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with vipdomet. during treatment with vipdomet, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or more frequently if you are elderly and/or if have worsening kidney function children and adolescents vipdomet is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data in these patients. other medicines and vipdomet if you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for example in the context of an x-ray or scan, you must stop taking vipdomet before or at the time of the injection. your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with vipdomet. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. you may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the dosage of vipdomet. it is especially important to mention the following: - hydrocortisone and prednisolone (corticosteroids), used to treat diseases that involve inflammation like asthma and arthritis - cimetidine, used to treat stomach problems - bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists), used to treat asthma - medicines which increase urine production (diuretics) - medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (nsaid and cox-2-inhibitors, such as ibuprofen and celecoxib), - certain medicines used for the treatment of high blood pressure (ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor antagonists) - medicines containing alcohol. vipdomet with alcohol avoid excessive alcohol intake while taking vipdomet since this may increase the risk of lactic acidosis - see section \"warnings and precautions\". pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. you should not use vipdomet if you are pregnant. vipdomet is not recommended during breast-feeding since metformin passes into breast milk. driving and using machines vipdomet is not known to affect your ability to drive and use machines. taking vipdomet in combination with medicines called pioglitazone or insulin can cause too low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may affect your ability to drive and use machines.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "vipdomet", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text":
