This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nBLENREP 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne vial of powder contains 100 mg of belantamab mafodotin.  \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution, the solution contains 50 mg belantamab mafodotin per mL. \n\n \n\nBelantamab mafodotin is an antibody-drug conjugate that contains belantamab, an afucosylated \n\nhumanised monoclonal IgG1k antibody specific for B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), produced \n\nusing recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary) that is \n\nconjugated with maleimidocaproyl monomethyl auristatin F (mcMMAF). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). \n\n \n\nLyophilised white to yellow powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nBLENREP is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients, who \n\nhave received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome \n\ninhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have \n\ndemonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with BLENREP should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the \n\ntreatment of multiple myeloma. \n\n \n\nRecommended supportive care \n\n \n\nPatients should have an ophthalmic examination (including visual acuity and slit lamp examination) \n\nperformed by an eye care professional at baseline, before the subsequent 3 treatment cycles, and as \n\nclinically indicated whilst on treatment (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPhysicians should advise patients to administer preservative-free artificial tears at least 4 times a day \n\nbeginning on the first day of infusion and continuing until completion of treatment as this may reduce \n\ncorneal symptoms (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nFor patients with dry eye symptoms, additional therapies may be considered as recommended by their \n\neye care professional.  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 2.5 mg/kg of BLENREP administered as an intravenous infusion once \n\nevery 3 weeks.  \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable \n\ntoxicity (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDose modifications \n\n \n\nRecommended dose modifications for corneal adverse reactions are provided in Table 1. Table 2 \n\nprovides dose modifications recommended for other adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nManagement of corneal adverse reactions \n\n \n\nCorneal adverse reactions may include findings upon eye examination and/or changes in visual acuity \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The treating physician should review the patient\u2019s ophthalmic examination \n\nreport before dosing and should determine the dose of BLENREP based on the highest category from \n\nthe report in the most severely affected eye as both eyes may not be affected to the same degree (Table \n\n1). \n\n \n\nDuring the ophthalmic examination, the eye care professional should assess the following: \n\n \n\n\u2022 The corneal examination finding(s) and the decline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). \n\n\u2022 If there is a decline in BCVA, the relationship of corneal examination findings to BLENREP \n\nshould be determined. \n\n\u2022 The highest category grading for these examination findings and BCVA should be reported to the \n\ntreating physician. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Once symptoms resolve, resume at \n\nlower infusion rate reduced by at least 50%. If \n\nanaphylactic or life-threatening infusion \n\nreaction, permanently discontinue the infusion \n\nand institute appropriate emergency care. \n\nAdverse reactions were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology \n\nCriteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR \uf0b330 \n\nmL/min). There are insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment to support a dose \n\nrecommendation (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin greater than ULN \n\nto less than or equal to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN or aspartate transaminase [AST] greater than ULN). There are \n\ninsufficient data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe \n\nhepatic impairment to support a dose recommendation (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\nBLENREP has not been studied in patients with body weight < 40 kg or > 130 kg (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of BLENREP in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nBLENREP is for intravenous use. \n\nBLENREP must be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional prior to administration as an \n\nintravenous infusion. BLENREP should be infused over a minimum of 30 minutes (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nCorneal adverse reactions \n\n \n\nCorneal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of BLENREP. The most commonly \n\nreported adverse reactions were keratopathy or microcyst-like epithelial changes in corneal epithelium \n\n(as seen on eye examination) with or without changes in visual acuity, blurred vision, and dry eye \n\nsymptoms. Patients with a history of dry eyes were more prone to develop changes in the corneal \n\nepithelium. Changes in visual acuity may be associated with difficulty in driving or operating \n\nmachinery (see section 4.7). \n\n \n\nOphthalmic examinations, including assessment of visual acuity and slit lamp examination, should be \n\nperformed at baseline, before the subsequent 3 treatment cycles and during treatment as clinically \n\nindicated. Patients should be advised to administer preservative-free artificial tears at least 4 times a \n\nday during treatment (see section 4.2). Patients should avoid using contact lenses until the end of \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nPatients experiencing keratopathy with or without changes in visual acuity may require a dose \n\nmodification (delay and/or reduction) or treatment discontinuation based on severity of findings (see \n\nTable 1). \n\n \n\nCases of corneal ulcer (ulcerative and infective keratitis) have been reported (see section 4.8). These \n\nshould be managed promptly and as clinically indicated by an eye care professional. Treatment with \n\nBLENREP should be interrupted until the corneal ulcer has healed (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenic events (thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) were frequently reported \n\nin study 205678.  Thrombocytopenia may lead to serious bleeding events, including gastrointestinal \n\nand intracranial bleeding. \n\n \n\nComplete blood counts should be obtained at baseline and monitored during treatment, as clinically \n\nindicated. Patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or those on concomitant anticoagulant \n\ntreatments may require more frequent monitoring and should be managed with a dose delay or dose \n\nreduction (see Table 2). Supportive therapy (e.g. platelet transfusions) should be provided according to \n\nstandard medical practice. \n\n \n\nInfusion-Related Reactions \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions (IRR) have been reported with BLENREP. Most IRRs were Grade 1-2 and \n\nresolved within the same day (see section 4.8). If a grade 2 or higher infusion- related reaction occurs \n\nduring administration, reduce the infusion rate or stop the infusion depending on the severity of the \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nsymptoms. Institute appropriate medical treatment and restart infusion at a slower rate, if the patient\u2019s \n\ncondition is stable. If Grade 2 or higher IRR occurs, administer premedication for subsequent \n\ninfusions (see Table 2). \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, that is to say \n\nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo formal drug interaction studies have been performed with belantamab mafodotin. \n\nBased on available in vitro and clinical data, there is a low risk of pharmacokinetic or \n\npharmacodynamic drug interactions for belantamab mafodotin (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen \n\nThe pregnancy status of child-bearing women should be verified prior to initiating therapy with \n\nBLENREP. \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with BLENREP \n\nand for 4 months after the last dose. \n\n \n\nMen \n\nMen with female partners of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during \n\ntreatment with BLENREP and for 6 months after the last dose. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no data from the use of BLENREP in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nBased on the mechanism of action of the cytotoxic component monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), \n\nbelantamab mafodotin can cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see \n\nsection 5.3). Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) is known to cross the placenta; therefore, belantamab \n\nmafodotin has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus (see section \n\n5.3). \n\n \n\nBLENREP should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the \n\npotential risks to the foetus. If a pregnant woman needs to be treated she should be clearly advised on \n\nthe potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether belantamab mafodotin is excreted into human milk. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) \n\nis present in human milk in small amounts. Since belantamab mafodotin is a humanised IgG \n\nmonoclonal antibody, and based on the mechanism of action, it may cause serious adverse reactions in \n\nbreast-fed children. Women should be advised to discontinue breast-feeding prior to initiating \n\ntreatment with BLENREP and for 3 months after the last dose. \n\n \n\nFertility  \n\n \n\nBased on findings in animals and the mechanism of action, belantamab mafodotin may impair fertility \n\nin females and males of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nTherefore, women of childbearing potential who may desire children in the future should be \n\ncounselled prior to therapy regarding the option of having eggs frozen before treatment. Men being \n\ntreated with this medicine are advised to have sperm samples frozen and stored before treatment.  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nBLENREP has a moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n\nPatients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machines as BLENREP may \n\naffect their vision.  \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions described in this section were reported from 95 patients who received BLENREP \n\n2.5 mg/kg in study 205678. The most frequent adverse reactions (\u226530%) were keratopathy (71%) and \n\nthrombocytopenia (38%). The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia \n\n(7%), pyrexia (7%) and IRRs (3%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in \n\n9% of patients who received BLENREP with 3% related to ocular adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 3 summarises adverse drug reactions that occurred in patients receiving the recommended dose \n\nof BLENREP 2.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks.  \n\n \n\nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 \n\nto < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, where relevant, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Infusion reactions may include, \n\nbut are not limited to, pyrexia, chills, diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, hypertension, lethargy, tachycardia. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nCorneal adverse reactions \n\n \n\nCorneal adverse reactions were assessed in Study 205678 from the safety population (n = 218) which \n\nincluded patients treated with 2.5 mg/kg (n=95). Eye disorder events occurred in 74% patients and the \n\nmost common adverse reactions were keratopathy or microcyst-like epithelial changes in corneal \n\nepithelium [identified on eye exam, with or without symptoms] (71%), blurred vision (25%), and dry \n\neye symptoms (15%). Decreased vision (Snellen Visual Acuity worse than 20/50) in the better eye was \n\nreported in 18% and severe vision loss (20/200 or worse) in the better seeing eye was reported in 1% \n\nof patients treated with belantamab mafodotin. \n\nThe median time to onset of Grade 2 or above corneal findings (best corrected visual acuity or \n\nkeratopathy on eye examination) was 36 days (range: 19 to 143 days). The median time to resolution \n\nof these corneal findings was 91 days (range: 21 to 201 days).  \n\nCorneal findings (keratopathy) led to dose delays in 47% of patients, and dose reductions in 27% of \n\npatients. Three percent of patients discontinued treatment due to ocular events. \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, the incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRR) with belantamab mafodotin \n\n2.5 mg/kg was 21%, and most (90%) occurred during the first infusion. Most IRRs were reported as \n\nGrade 1 (6%) and Grade 2 (12%) while 3% experienced Grade 3 IRRs. Serious IRRs were reported by \n\n4% of patients and included symptoms of pyrexia and lethargy. Median time to onset and the median \n\nduration of the first occurrence of an IRR was 1 day. One patient (1%) discontinued treatment due to \n\nIRRs, experiencing Grade 3 IRRs at first and second infusion. No Grade 4 or 5 IRRs were reported.  \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenic events, (thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) occurred in 38% of \n\npatients treated with belantamab mafodotin 2.5 mg/kg. Grade 2 thrombocytopenic events occurred in \n\n3% of patients, Grade 3 in 9%, and Grade 4 in 13%. Grade 3 bleeding events occurred in 2% of \n\npatients and no Grade 4 or 5 events were reported.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nUpper respiratory tract infections were commonly reported across the belantamab mafodotin clinical \n\nprogramme and were mostly mild to moderate (Grade 1 to 3), occurring in 9% of patients treated with \n\nbelantamab mafodotin 2.5 mg/kg. There were no SAEs of upper respiratory tract infections reported.  \n\nPneumonia was the most frequent infection reported in 11% of patients treated with belantamab \n\nmafodotin 2.5 mg/kg. Pneumonia was also the most frequent SAE, reported in 7% of patients. \n\nInfections with a fatal outcome were primarily due to pneumonia (1%). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere has been no experience of overdosage in clinical studies.  \n\n \n\nThere is no known specific antidote for belantamab mafodotin overdose. In the event of an overdose, \n\nthe patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and appropriate \n\nsupportive treatment should be instituted immediately. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC39 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nBelantamab mafodotin is a humanised IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody conjugated with a cytotoxic agent, \n\nmaleimidocaproyl monomethyl auristatin F (mcMMAF). Belantamab mafodotin binds to cell surface \n\nBCMA and is rapidly internalised. Once inside the tumour cell, the cytotoxic agent is released \n\ndisrupting the microtubule network, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The antibody enhances \n\nrecruitment and activation of immune effector cells, killing tumour cells by antibody-dependent \n\ncellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. Apoptosis induced by belantamab mafodotin is accompanied \n\nby markers of immunogenic cell death, which may contribute to an adaptive immune response to \n\ntumour cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nCardiac Electrophysiology \n\nBased on exposure-QTc analysis, belantamab mafodotin had no meaningful QTc prolongation (>10 \n\nms) at the recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies in patients with multiple myeloma, <1% of patients (2/274) tested positive for anti-\n\nbelantamab mafodotin antibodies after receiving belantamab mafodotin. One of the two patients tested \n\npositive for neutralising anti-belantamab mafodotin antibodies. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nStudy 205678 was an open-label, two arm, Phase II, multicentre study which evaluated belantamab \n\nmafodotin as monotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma who had relapsed following treatment \n\nwith at least 3 prior therapies, and who were refractory to an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome \n\ninhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody alone or in combination.

Geometric mean belantamab \n\nmafodotin Cmax and AUC(0-tau) concentrations were 43 mcg/mL and 4,666 mcg.h/mL, respectively. \n\nGeometric mean cys-mcMMAF Cmax and AUC(0-168h) concentrations were 0.90 ng/mL and 84 ng.h/mL, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe mean steady-state volume of distribution of belantamab mafodotin was 10.8 L. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nThe monoclonal antibody portion of belantamab mafodotin is expected to undergo proteolysis to small \n\npeptides and individual amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes. Cys-mcMMAF had limited \n\nmetabolic clearance in human hepatic S9 fraction incubation studies. \n\n \n\nDrug interactions \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that cys-mcMMAF is a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP2, \n\nMRP3, bile salt export pump (BSEP), and a possible substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nBelantamab mafodotin was cleared slowly with total plasma clearance of 0.92 L/day and a terminal \n\nphase half-life of 12 days. Over time, clearance was reduced to 0.72 L/day with an elimination half-\n\nlife of 14 days. Predose cys-mcMMAF concentrations at each dose were typically below the limit of \n\nquantification (0.05 ng/mL). \n\n \n\nIn an animal study, approximately 83% of the radioactive dose was excreted in the faeces; urinary \n\nexcretion (approximately 13%) was a minor route; intact cys-mcMMAF was detected in human urine, \n\nwith no evidence of other MMAF-related metabolites. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nBelantamab mafodotin exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over the recommended dose range \n\nwith a reduction in clearance over time. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients (\u226565 years old) \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nNo formal studies have been conducted in elderly patients. Age was not a significant covariate in \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic analyses. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo formal studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment.  Renal function was not a \n\nsignificant covariate in population pharmacokinetic analyses that included patients with normal renal \n\nfunction and mild or moderate renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.  Hepatic function was not \n\na significant covariate in population pharmacokinetic analyses that included patients with normal \n\nhepatic function or mild hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\nBody weight was a significant covariate in population pharmacokinetic analyses. Belantamab \n\nmafodotin Ctau was predicted to be +10% at a body weight of 100 kg (+20% for 130 kg) and -10% at a \n\nbody weight of 55 kg (-20% for 40 kg) compared to the typical patient (75 kg). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAnimal toxicology and/or pharmacology \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical studies, the principal adverse findings (directly related to belantamab mafodotin) in the \n\nrat and monkey, at exposures \u22651.2 times of the recommended clinical dose of 2.5 mg/kg, were \n\nelevated liver enzymes sometimes associated with hepatocellular necrosis at \u2265 10 and \u22653 mg/kg, \n\nrespectively, and increases in alveolar macrophages associated with eosinophilic material in the lungs \n\nat \u22653 mg/kg (rat only).Most findings in animals were related to the cytotoxic drug conjugate, the \n\nhistopathological changes observed in the testes and lungs, were not reversible in rats. \n\n \n\nSingle cell necrosis in the corneal epithelium and/or increased mitoses of corneal epithelial cells was \n\nobserved in rat and rabbit. Belantamab mafodotin was taken up into cells throughout the body by a \n\nmechanism unrelated to BCMA receptor expression on the cell membrane.  \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis/mutagenesis \n\n \n\nBelantamab mafodotin was genotoxic in an in vitro screening assay in human lymphocytes, consistent \n\nwith the pharmacological effect of cys-mcMMAF-mediated disruption of microtubules causing \n\naneuploidy. \n\nNo carcinogenicity or definitive genotoxicity studies have been conducted with belantamab mafodotin. \n\n \n\nReproductive Toxicology \n\n \n\nNo animal studies have been performed to evaluate the potential effects of belantamab mafodotin on \n\nreproduction or development. The mechanism of action is to kill rapidly dividing cells which would \n\naffect a developing embryo which has rapidly dividing cells. There is also a potential risk of heritable \n\nchanges via aneuploidy in female germ cells. \n\n \n\nEffects on male and female reproductive organs have been observed in animals at doses of \n\n\u2265 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 4 times the exposure of the clinical dose. Luteinized nonovulatory \n\nfollicles were seen in the ovaries of rats after 3 weekly doses. Findings in male reproductive organs, \n\nthat were adverse and progressed following repeat dosing in rat, included marked \n\ndegeneration/atrophy of seminiferous tubules that generally did not reverse following dosing \n\ncessation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

What you need to know before you are given BLENREP \n\n3. How BLENREP is given  \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store BLENREP \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n1. What BLENREP is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nBLENREP contains the active substance belantamab mafodotin, a monoclonal antibody connected to \n\nan anticancer substance that can kill multiple myeloma cells. The monoclonal antibody is a protein \n\ndesigned to find the multiple myeloma cancer cells in your body and bind to them.  \n\nOnce attached to the cancer cells, the anticancer substance is released and kills the cancer cells. \n\n \n\nBLENREP is used to treat adults who have cancer of the bone marrow called multiple myeloma. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given BLENREP  \n\n \n\nDo not receive BLENREP: \n\n- if you are allergic to belantamab mafodotin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).  \n\n\u2794 Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nEye problems \n\nBLENREP can cause dry eyes, blurred vision or other eye problems. \n\nYou should have an eye examination by an eye specialist before starting treatment and for the next \n\nthree doses of BLENREP. Your doctor may request further eye tests whilst on treatment with \n\nBLENREP. Even if your vision seems fine, it is important that you get your eyes checked during \n\ntreatment with BLENREP because some changes can happen without symptoms and may only be seen \n\non an eye examination. \n\n\u2794 Do not use contact lenses while you are receiving treatment. \n\nYour doctor will ask you to use eye drops called preservative-free artificial tears at least 4 times a day \n\nduring treatment to moisten and lubricate your eyes. You should apply them as instructed. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nIf you notice changes with your vision, your doctor may hold treatment with BLENREP or adjust the \n\ndose or ask you to see an eye specialist. Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with BLENREP. \n\n\u2794 Contact your doctor if you have blurred vision or other eye problems.  \n\nAbnormal bruising and bleeding  \n\n \n\nBLENREP can decrease the number of blood cells called platelets which help to clot your blood.  \n\nSymptoms of low platelets counts (thrombocytopenia) include: \n\n\u2022 abnormal bruising under the skin, \n\n\u2022 bleeding longer than usual after a test, \n\n\u2022 bleeding from your nose or your gums or more serious bleeding.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will ask you to have a blood test before you start treatment, and regularly during \n\ntreatment with BLENREP, to check that your platelet levels are normal. \n\n\u2794 Tell your doctor if you develop abnormal bleeding or bruising, or any symptoms that worry \n\nyou. \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n\n \n\nBLENREP is given by a drip (infusion) into a vein. Some people who receive infusions develop \n\ninfusion-related reactions. \n\n\u2794 See \u2018Infusion-related reactions\u2019 in Section 4.  \n\nIf you have previously had a reaction to an infusion of BLENREP, or any other medicine: \n\n\u2794 Tell your doctor or nurse before you receive another infusion. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nThis medicine is not intended for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and BLENREP \n\n\u2794 Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and fertility \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby: \n\n\u2794 Tell your doctor before you are given this medicine. \n\n \n\nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant: \n\n\u2022 Your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start treatment with BLENREP. \n\n\u2022 You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after your last dose \n\nof BLENREP.  \n\nWomen being treated with this medicine who wish to have children are advised to seek fertility \n\ncounselling and consider options to freeze eggs/embryos before treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you are a man who could father a child: \n\n\u2022 You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after your last dose \n\nof BLENREP. \n\nMen being treated with this medicine are advised to have sperm samples frozen and stored before \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nYou must not breast-feed during treatment and for 3 months after your last dose of BLENREP. \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nIt is not known if the medicine passes into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about this. \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nBLENREP can cause problems with vision that can affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n\n\u2794 Do not drive or use machines unless you are sure your vision is not affected. Talk to your \n\ndoctor if you are not sure. \n\nBLENREP contains sodium  \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, that is to say essentially \n\n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\n3. How BLENREP is given \n\n \n\nYour doctor will decide on the correct dose of BLENREP. The dose is calculated based on your body \n\nweight. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 2.5 mg of BLENREP per kilogram of your body weight. It is given by your \n\ndoctor or nurse as a drip into a vein (intravenous infusion) every three weeks. \n\n \n\nBefore your infusion, you should apply lubricating and moistening eye drops (preservative-free \n\nartificial tears). You should continue to use the eye drops at least 4 times a day whilst  you are \n\nreceiving treatment with BLENREP. \n\nIf you given more BLENREP than you should \n\n \n\nThis medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much \n\n(an overdose) your doctor will check you for side effects. \n\nIf a dose of BLENREP is missed \n\n \n\nIt is very important to go to all your appointments, to make sure your treatment works. If you miss an \n\nappointment, make another one as soon as possible. \n\n\u2794 Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment. \n\n \n\n4.

Proper handling procedures should be \n\nfollowed. Use aseptic technique for the reconstitution and dilution of the dosing solution. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of BLENREP is 2.5 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion once \n\nevery 3 weeks.  \n\n \n\nCalculate the dose (mg), total volume (mL) of solution required and the number of vials needed based \n\non the patient\u2019s actual body weight (kg). \n\n \n\nReconstitution \n\n1. Remove the vial(s) of BLENREP from the refrigerator and allow to stand for approximately 10 \n\nminutes to reach room temperature. \n\n2. Reconstitute each vial with 2 mL of water for injections to obtain a concentration of 50 mg/mL. \n\nGently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. Do not shake. \n\n3. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The \n\nreconstituted solution should be a clear to opalescent, colourless to yellow to brown liquid. \n\nDiscard the reconstituted vial if extraneous particulate matter other than translucent to white \n\nproteinaceous particles is observed. \n\n \n\nDilution Instructions for Intravenous Use \n\n \n\n1. Withdraw the necessary volume for the calculated dose from each vial. \n\n2. Add the necessary amount of BLENREP to the infusion bag containing 250 mL of sodium chloride \n\n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Mix the diluted solution by gentle inversion. The final \n\nconcentration of the diluted solution should be between 0.2 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL. DO NOT \n\nSHAKE. \n\n3. Discard any unused reconstituted solution of BLENREP left in the vial. \n \n\nIf the diluted solution is not used immediately, it may be stored in a refrigerator (2\u00baC to 8\u00baC) for up to \n\n24 hours prior to administration. If refrigerated, allow the diluted solution to equilibrate to room \n\ntemperature prior to administration. The diluted solution may be kept at room temperature (20\u00baC to \n\n25\u00baC) for a maximum of 6 hours (including infusion time). \n\nAdministration Instructions \n\n1. Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion over a minimum of 30 minutes using an \n\ninfusion set made of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin. \n\n2. Filtration of the diluted solution is not required. However, if the diluted solution is filtered, \n\npolyethersulfone (PES) based filter is recommended. \n\n \n\nDisposal \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnex IV \n\nConclusions on the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation and similarity \n\npresented by the European Medicines Agency \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nConclusions presented by the European Medicines Agency on: \n\n\u2022 Conditional marketing authorisation \n\nThe CHMP having considered the application is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance is \n\nfavourable to recommend the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation as further \n\nexplained in the European Public Assessment Report. \n\n\u2022 Similarity  \n\nThe CHMP is of the opinion that Blenrep is not similar to authorised orphan medicinal products \n\nwithin the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 as further explained \n\nin the European Public Assessment Report.  \n\n \n\n\n\tANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

need to know before you are given blenrep", "Section_Content": "do not receive blenrep: - if you are allergic to belantamab mafodotin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. warnings and precautions eye problems blenrep can cause dry eyes, blurred vision or other eye problems. you should have an eye examination by an eye specialist before starting treatment and for the next three doses of blenrep. your doctor may request further eye tests whilst on treatment with blenrep. even if your vision seems fine, it is important that you get your eyes checked during treatment with blenrep because some changes can happen without symptoms and may only be seen on an eye examination. do not use contact lenses while you are receiving treatment. your doctor will ask you to use eye drops called preservative-free artificial tears at least 4 times a day during treatment to moisten and lubricate your eyes. you should apply them as instructed. if you notice changes with your vision, your doctor may hold treatment with blenrep or adjust the dose or ask you to see an eye specialist. your doctor may decide to stop treatment with blenrep. contact your doctor if you have blurred vision or other eye problems. abnormal bruising and bleeding blenrep can decrease the number of blood cells called platelets which help to clot your blood. symptoms of low platelets counts (thrombocytopenia) include: abnormal bruising under the skin, bleeding longer than usual after a test, bleeding from your nose or your gums or more serious bleeding. your doctor will ask you to have a blood test before you start treatment, and regularly during treatment with blenrep, to check that your platelet levels are normal. tell your doctor if you develop abnormal bleeding or bruising, or any symptoms that worry you. infusion-related reactions blenrep is given by a drip (infusion) into a vein. some people who receive infusions develop infusion-related reactions. see 'infusion-related reactions' in section 4. if you have previously had a reaction to an infusion of blenrep, or any other medicine: tell your doctor or nurse before you receive another infusion. children and adolescents this medicine is not intended for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age. other medicines and blenrep tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy and fertility if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby: tell your doctor before you are given this medicine. if you are a woman who could become pregnant: your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start treatment with blenrep. you must use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after your last dose of blenrep. women being treated with this medicine who wish to have children are advised to seek fertility counselling and consider options to freeze eggs/embryos before treatment. if you are a man who could father a child: you must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after your last dose of blenrep. men being treated with this medicine are advised to have sperm samples frozen and stored before treatment. breast-feeding you must not breast-feed during treatment and for 3 months after your last dose of blenrep. it is not known if the medicine passes into breast milk. talk to your doctor about this. driving and using machines blenrep can cause problems with vision that can affect your ability to drive or use machines. do not drive or use machines unless you are sure your vision is not affected. talk to your doctor if you are not sure. blenrep contains sodium this
