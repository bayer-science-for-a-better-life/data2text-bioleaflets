NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTygacil 50 mg powder for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach 5 ml Tygacil vial contains 50 mg of tigecycline. After reconstitution, 1 ml contains 10 mg of \ntigecycline.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for solution for infusion (powder for infusion).\n\nOrange cake or powder.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTygacil is indicated in adults and in children from the age of eight years for the treatment of the \nfollowing infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1):\n\n Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding diabetic foot infections (see \nsection 4.4);\n\n Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI).\n\nTygacil should be used only in situations where other alternative antibiotics are not suitable (see \nsections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nAdults\nThe recommended dose for adults is an initial dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for \n5 to 14 days.\n\nThe duration of therapy should be guided by the severity, site of the infection, and the patient’s \nclinical response.\n\nChildren and adolescents (8 to 17 years of age)\nTigecycline is only to be used to treat patients aged 8 years and older after consultation with a \nphysician with appropriate experience in the management of infectious diseases.\n\nChildren aged 8 to <12 years: 1.2 mg/kg of tigecycline every 12 hours intravenously to a \nmaximum dose of 50 mg every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days.\n\nAdolescents aged 12 to <18 years: 50 mg of tigecycline every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days.\n\n\n\n3\n\nElderly\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is warranted in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh \nA and Child Pugh B).\n\nIn patients (including paediatrics) with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), the dose of \ntigecycline should be reduced by 50%. Adult dose should be reduced to 25 mg every 12 hours \nfollowing the 100 mg loading dose. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) should be \ntreated with caution and monitored for treatment response (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment or in patients undergoing \nhaemodialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Tygacil in children under 8 years of age have not been established. No data \nare available. Tygacil should not be used in children aged under 8 years because of teeth \ndiscolouration (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nTigecycline is administered only by intravenous infusion over 30 to 60 minutes (see sections 4.4 \nand 6.6). Tigecycline should be preferably administered over a 60-minute length of infusion in \npaediatric patients (see section 4.4).\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution & dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients hypersensitive to tetracycline class antibiotics may be hypersensitive to tigecycline.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nIn clinical studies in complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), complicated intra-abdominal \ninfections (cIAI), diabetic foot infections, nosocomial pneumonia and studies in resistant pathogens, a \nnumerically higher mortality rate among tigecycline treated patients has been observed as compared \nto the comparator treatment. The causes of these findings remain unknown, but poorer efficacy and \nsafety than the study comparators cannot be ruled out.\n\nSuperinfection\n\nIn clinical trials in cIAI patients, impaired healing of the surgical wound has been associated with \nsuperinfection. A patient developing impaired healing should be monitored for the detection of \nsuperinfection (see section 4.8).\n\nPatients who develop superinfections, in particular nosocomial pneumonia, appear to be associated \nwith poorer outcomes. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of superinfection. If \na focus of infection other than cSSTI or cIAI is identified after initiation of tigecycline therapy \nconsideration should be given to instituting alternative antibacterial therapy that has been \ndemonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of the specific type of infection(s) present.\n\n\n\n4\n\nAnaphylaxis\n\nAnaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, potentially life-threatening, have been reported with tigecycline \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.8).\n\nHepatic failure\n\nCases of liver injury with a predominantly cholestatic pattern have been reported in patients receiving \ntigecycline treatment, including some cases of hepatic failure with a fatal outcome. Although hepatic \nfailure may occur in patients treated with tigecycline due to the underlying conditions or concomitant \nmedicinal products, a possible contribution of tigecycline should be considered (see section 4.8).\n\nTetracycline class antibiotics\n\nGlycylcycline class antibiotics are structurally similar to tetracycline class antibiotics. Tigecycline \nmay have adverse reactions similar to tetracycline class antibiotics. Such reactions may include \nphotosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, pancreatitis, and anti-anabolic action which has led to \nincreased BUN, azotaemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphataemia (see section 4.8). \n\nPancreatitis\n\nAcute pancreatitis, which can be serious, has occurred (frequency: uncommon) in association with \ntigecycline treatment (see section 4.8). The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be considered in \npatients taking tigecycline who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities \nsuggestive of acute pancreatitis. Most of the reported cases developed after at least one week of \ntreatment. Cases have been reported in patients without known risk factors for pancreatitis. Patients \nusually improve after tigecycline discontinuation. Consideration should be given to the cessation of \nthe treatment with tigecycline in cases suspected of having developed pancreatitis.\n\nCoagulopathy\n\nTigecycline may prolong both prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time \n(aPTT). Additionally, hypofibrinogenaemia has been reported with the use of tigecycline. Therefore, \nblood coagulation parameters such as PT or other suitable anticoagulation test, including blood \nfibrinogen, should be monitored prior to treatment initiation with tigecycline and regularly while on \ntreatment. Special care is recommended in seriously ill patients and in patients also using \nanticoagulants (see section 4.5).\n\nUnderlying diseases\n\nExperience in the use of tigecycline for treatment of infections in patients with severe underlying \ndiseases is limited.\n\nIn clinical trials in cSSTI, the most common type of infection in tigecycline treated-patients was \ncellulitis (58.6 %), followed by major abscesses (24.9 %). Patients with severe underlying disease, \nsuch as those that were immunocompromised, patients with decubitus ulcer infections, or patients that \nhad infections requiring longer than 14 days of treatment (for example, necrotizing fasciitis), were not \nenrolled. A limited number of patients were enrolled with co-morbid factors such as diabetes \n(25.8 %), peripheral vascular disease (10.4 %), intravenous substance abuse (4.0 %), and HIV-\npositive infection (1.2 %). Limited experience is also available in treating patients with concurrent \nbacteraemia (3.4 %). Therefore, caution is advised when treating such patients. The results in a large \nstudy in patients with diabetic foot infection, showed that tigecycline was less effective than \ncomparator, therefore, tigecycline is not recommended for use in these patients (see section 4.1).\n\n\n\n5\n\nIn clinical trials in cIAI, the most common type of infection in tigecycline-treated patients was \ncomplicated appendicitis (50.3 %), followed by other diagnoses less commonly reported such as \ncomplicated cholecystitis (9.6 %), perforation of intestine (9.6 %), intra-abdominal abscess (8.7 %), \ngastric or duodenal ulcer perforation (8.3 %), peritonitis (6.2 %) and complicated diverticulitis (6.0 \n%). Of these patients, 77.8 % had surgically-apparent peritonitis. There were a limited number of \npatients with severe underlying disease such as immunocompromised patients, patients with \nAPACHE II scores  15 (3.3 %), or with surgically apparent multiple intra-abdominal abscesses \n(11.4 %). Limited experience is also available in treating patients with concurrent bacteraemia \n(5.6 %). Therefore, caution is advised when treating such patients.\n\nConsideration should be given to the use of combination antibacterial therapy whenever tigecycline is \nto be administered to severely ill patients with cIAI secondary to clinically apparent intestinal \nperforation or patients with incipient sepsis or septic shock (see section 4.8).\n\nThe effect of cholestasis in the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline has not been properly established.\nBiliary excretion accounts for approximately 50 % of the total tigecycline excretion. Therefore, \npatients presenting with cholestasis should be closely monitored.\n\nPseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in \nseverity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients \nwho present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of any antibacterial agent (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nThe use of tigecycline may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. \nPatients should be carefully monitored during therapy (see section 4.8).\n\nResults of studies in rats with tigecycline have shown bone discolouration. Tigecycline may be \nassociated with permanent tooth discolouration in humans if used during tooth development (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nClinical experience in the use of tigecycline for the treatment of infections in paediatric patients aged \n8 years and older is very limited (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Consequently, use in children should be \nrestricted to those clinical situations where no alternative antibacterial therapy is available.\n\nNausea and vomiting are very common adverse reactions in children and adolescents (see section 4.8). \nAttention should be paid to possible dehydration. Tigecycline should be preferably administered over\na 60-minute length of infusion in paediatric patients. \n\nAbdominal pain is commonly reported in children as it is in adults. Abdominal pain may be indicative \nof pancreatitis. If pancreatitis develops, treatment with tigecycline should be discontinued.    \n\nLiver function tests, coagulation parameters, haematology parameters, amylase and lipase should be \nmonitored prior to treatment initiation with tigecycline and regularly while on treatment.\n\nTygacil should not be used in children under 8 years of age due to the lack of safety and efficacy data \nin this age group and because tigecycline may be associated with permanent teeth discolouration (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nExcipient information\n\nTygacil contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 ml of suspension. Patients on low sodium \ndiets can be informed that this medicinal product is essentially ‘sodium free’.\n\n\n\n6\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nConcomitant administration of tigecycline and warfarin (25 mg single-dose) to healthy subjects \nresulted in a decrease in clearance of R-warfarin and S-warfarin by 40 % and 23 %, and an increase in \nAUC by 68 % and 29 %, respectively. The mechanism of this interaction is still not elucidated. \nAvailable data does not suggest that this interaction may result in significant INR changes. However, \nsince tigecycline may prolong both prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time \n(aPTT), the relevant coagulation tests should be closely monitored when tigecycline is \nco-administered with anticoagulants (see section 4.4). Warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetic \nprofile of tigecycline.\n\nTigecycline is not extensively metabolised. Therefore, clearance of tigecycline is not expected to be \naffected by active substances that inhibit or induce the activity of the CYP450 isoforms. In vitro, \ntigecycline is neither a competitive inhibitor nor an irreversible inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nTigecycline in recommended dosage did not affect the rate or extent of absorption, or clearance of \ndigoxin (0.5 mg followed by 0.25 mg daily) when administered in healthy adults. Digoxin did not \naffect the pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary when \ntigecycline is administered with digoxin.\n\nIn in vitro studies, no antagonism has been observed between tigecycline and other commonly used \nantibiotic classes.\n\nConcurrent use of antibiotics with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.\n\nConcomitant use of tigecycline and calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine may lead \nto an increase in serum trough concentrations of the calcineurin inhibitors. Therefore, serum \nconcentrations of the calcineurin inhibitor should be monitored during treatment with tigecycline to \navoid drug toxicity.\n\nBased on an in vitro study tigecycline is a P-gp substrate. Co-administration of P-gp inhibitors (e.g., \nketoconazole or cyclosporine) or P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin) could affect the pharmacokinetics of \ntigecycline (see section 5.2).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of tigecycline in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nAs it is known for tetracycline class antibiotics, tigecycline may also induce permanent dental defects \n(discolouration and enamel defects) and a delay in ossification processes in foetuses, exposed in utero\nduring the last half of gestation, and in children under eight years of age due to the enrichment in \ntissues with a high calcium turnover and formation of calcium chelate complexes (see section 4.4). \nTigecycline should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with tigecycline.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether tigecycline/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tigecycline/metabolites in \nmilk (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made \n\n\n\n7\n\nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from tigecycline therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nTigecycline did not affect mating or fertility in rats at exposures up to 4.7 times the human daily dose \nbased on AUC. In female rats, there were no compound-related effects on ovaries or oestrus cycles at \nexposures up to 4.7 times the human daily dose based on AUC.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDizziness may occur and this may have an effect on driving and use of machines (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of safety profile\n\nThe total number of cSSTI and cIAI patients treated with tigecycline in Phase 3 and 4 clinical studies \nwas 2,393.\n\nIn clinical trials, the most common medicinal product-related treatment emergent adverse reactions \nwere reversible nausea (21 %) and vomiting (13 %), which usually occurred early (on treatment days \n1-2) and were generally mild or moderate in severity.\n\nAdverse reactions reported with tigecycline, including clinical trials and post-marketing experience, \nare tabulated below.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nSystem \nOrgan Class\n\nVery \nCommon\n≥ 1/10\n\nCommon\n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10\n\nUncommon\n≥ 1/1,000 to\n< 1/100\n\nRare\n≥ 1/10,000 to\n< 1/1,000\n\nFrequency\nnot known\n(cannot be\nestimated\nfrom the \navailable\ndata)\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nsepsis/septic \nshock, \npneumonia, \nabscess, \ninfections\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nprolonged \nactivated \npartial \nthromboplasti\nn time (aPTT), \nprolonged \nprothrombin \ntime (PT)\n\nthrombocytop\nenia, increased \ninternational \nnormalised \nratio (INR)\n\nhypofibrinoge\nnaemia\n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nanaphylaxis/\nanaphylactoid \nreactions* (see \nsections 4.3 \nand 4.4)\n\n\n\n8\n\nSystem \nOrgan Class\n\nVery \nCommon\n≥ 1/10\n\nCommon\n≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10\n\nUncommon\n≥ 1/1,000 to\n< 1/100\n\nRare\n≥ 1/10,000 to\n< 1/1,000\n\nFrequency\nnot known\n(cannot be\nestimated\nfrom the \navailable\ndata)\n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders\n\nhypoglycaemi\na, \nhypoproteinae\nmia\n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\ndizziness\n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nphlebitis thrombophlebi\ntis\n\nGastrointestin\nal disorders \n\nnausea, \nvomiting, \ndiarrhoea\n\nabdominal \npain, \ndyspepsia, \nanorexia\n\nacute \npancreatitis \n(see section \n4.4)\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nelevated \naspartate \naminotransfera\nse (AST) in \nserum, and \nelevated \nalanine \naminotransfera\nse (ALT) in \nserum, \nhyperbilirubin\naemia\n\njaundice, liver \ninjury, mostly \ncholestatic\n\nhepatic \nfailure* (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\npruritus, rash severe skin \nreactions, \nincluding \nStevens-\nJohnson \nSyndrome*\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nimpaired \nhealing, \ninjection site \nreaction, \nheadache\n\ninjection site \ninflammation, \ninjection site \npain, \ninjection site \noedema, \ninjection site \nphlebitis\n\nInvestigations elevated \namylase in \nserum, \nincreased \nblood urea \nnitrogen \n(BUN)\n\n*ADR identified post-marketing\n\n\n\n9\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAntibiotic class effects\n\nPseudomembranous colitis which may range in severity from mild to life threatening (see section 4.4).\n\nOvergrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi (see section 4.4).\n\nTetracycline class effects\n\nGlycylcycline class antibiotics are structurally similar to tetracycline class antibiotics. Tetracycline \nclass adverse reactions may include photosensitivity, pseudotumour cerebri, pancreatitis, and anti-\nanabolic action which has led to increased BUN, azotaemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphataemia (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nTigecycline may be associated with permanent tooth discolouration if used during tooth development \n(see section 4.4).\n\nIn Phase 3 and 4 cSSTI and cIAI clinical studies, infection-related serious adverse reactions were \nmore frequently reported for subjects treated with tigecycline (7.1 %) vs comparators (5.3 %). \nSignificant differences in sepsis/septic shock with tigecycline (2.2 %) vs comparators (1.1 %) were \nobserved.\n\nAST and ALT abnormalities in tigecycline-treated patients were reported more frequently in the post \ntherapy period than in those in comparator-treated patients, which occurred more often on therapy.\n\nIn all Phase 3 and 4 (cSSTI and cIAI) studies, death occurred in 2.4 % (54/2216) of patients receiving \ntigecycline and 1.7% (37/2206) of patients receiving active comparators.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nVery limited safety data were available from two PK studies (see section 5.2). No new or unexpected \nsafety concerns were observed with tigecycline in these studies.\n\nIn an open-label, single ascending dose PK study, the safety of tigecycline was investigated in \n25 children aged 8 to 16 years who recently recovered from infections. The adverse reaction profile of \ntigecycline in these 25 subjects was generally consistent with that in adults.\n\nThe safety of tigecycline was also investigated in an open-label, ascending multi-dose PK study in \n58 children aged 8 to 11 years with cSSTI (n=15), cIAI (n=24) or community-acquired pneumonia \n(n=19). The adverse reaction profile of tigecycline in these 58 subjects was generally consistent with \nthat in adults, with the exception of nausea (48.3 %), vomiting (46.6 %) and elevated lipase in serum\n(6.9 %) which were seen at greater frequencies in children than in adults.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage. Intravenous administration of \ntigecycline at a single dose of 300 mg over 60 minutes in healthy volunteers resulted in an increased \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10\n\nincidence of nausea and vomiting. Tigecycline is not removed in significant quantities by \nhaemodialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, tetracyclines, ATC code: J01AA12.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic, inhibits protein translation in bacteria by binding to the 30S \nribosomal subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome. \nThis prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains.\n\nIn general, tigecycline is considered bacteriostatic. At 4 times the minimum inhibitory concentration \n(MIC), a 2-log reduction in colony counts was observed with tigecycline against Enterococcus spp., \nStaphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. \n\nMechanism of resistance\n\nTigecycline is able to overcome the two major tetracycline resistance mechanisms, ribosomal \nprotection and efflux. Cross-resistance between tigecycline and minocycline-resistant isolates among \nthe Enterobacteriaceae due to multi-drug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps has been shown. There is \nno target-based cross-resistance between tigecycline and most classes of antibiotics.\n\nTigecycline is vulnerable to chromosomally-encoded multi-drug efflux pumps of Proteeae and \nPseudomonas aeruginosa. Pathogens of the family Proteeae (Proteus spp., Providencia spp., and \nMorganella spp.) are generally less susceptible to tigecycline than other members of the \nEnterobacteriaceae. Decreased susceptibility in both groups has been attributed to the overexpression \nof the non-specific AcrAB multi-drug efflux pump. Decreased susceptibility in Acinetobacter \nbaumannii has been attributed to the overexpression of the AdeABC efflux pump.\n\nBreakpoints\n\nMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are as follows:\n\nStaphylococcus spp. S  0.5 mg/L and R  0.5 mg/L\nStreptococcus spp. other than S. pneumoniae S  0.25 mg/L and R  0.5 mg/L\nEnterococcus spp. S  0.25 mg/L and R  0.5 mg/L\nEnterobacteriaceae S  1(^) mg/L and R  2 mg/L\n\n(^)Tigecycline has decreased in vitro activity against Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella spp.\n\nFor anaerobic bacteria there is clinical evidence of efficacy in polymicrobial intra-abdominal \ninfections, but no correlation between MIC values, PK/PD data and clinical outcome. Therefore, no \nbreakpoint for susceptibility is given. It should be noted that the MIC distributions for organisms of \nthe genera Bacteroides and Clostridium are wide and may include values in excess of 2 mg/L \ntigecycline.\n\nThere is limited evidence of the clinical efficacy of tigecycline against enterococci. However, \npolymicrobial intra-abdominal infections have shown to respond to treatment with tigecycline in \nclinical trials.\n\n\n\n11\n\nSusceptibility\n\nThe prevalence of acquired resistance may vary geographically and with time for selected species, and \nlocal information on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections. As necessary, \nexpert advice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the \nagent in at least some types of infections is questionable.\n\nPathogen\n\nCommonly Susceptible Species\nGram-positive Aerobes\nEnterococcus spp.†\nStaphylococcus aureus*\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\nStaphylococcus haemolyticus\nStreptococcus agalactiae*\nStreptococcus anginosus group* (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius and S. constellatus)\nStreptococcus pyogenes*\nViridans group streptococci\n\nGram-negative Aerobes\nCitrobacter freundii*\nCitrobacter koseri\nEscherichia coli*\nKlebsiella oxytoca*\n\nAnaerobes\nClostridium perfringens†\nPeptostreptococcus spp.†\nPrevotella spp.\nSpecies for which acquired resistance may be a problem\nGram-negative Aerobes\nAcinetobacter baumannii\nBurkholderia cepacia\nEnterobacter aerogenes\nEnterobacter cloacae*\nKlebsiella pneumoniae*\nMorganella morganii\nProteus spp.\nProvidencia spp.\nSerratia marcescens\nStenotrophomonas maltophilia\n\nAnaerobes\nBacteroides fragilis group†\nInherently resistant organisms\nGram-negative Aerobes\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n*denotes species against which it is considered that activity has been satisfactorily demonstrated in \nclinical studies.\n† see section 5.1, Breakpoints above.\n\n\n\n12\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology \n\nNo significant effect of a single intravenous dose of tigecycline 50 mg or 200 mg on QTc interval was \ndetected in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled four-arm crossover thorough QTc study of \n46 healthy subjects.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn an open-label, ascending multiple-dose study, 39 children aged 8 to 11 years with cIAI or cSSTI \nwere administered tigecycline (0.75, 1, or 1.25 mg/kg). All patients received IV tigecycline for a \nminimum of 3 consecutive days to a maximum of 14 consecutive days, with the option to be switched \nto an oral antibiotic on or after day 4. \n\nClinical cure was assessed between 10 and 21 days after the administration of the last dose of \ntreatment. The summary of clinical response in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population results \nis shown in the following table. \n\nClinical Cure, mITT Population\n0.75 mg/kg 1 mg/kg 1.25 mg/kg\n\nIndication n/N (%) n/N (%) n/N (%)\ncIAI 6/6 (100.0) 3/6 (50.0) 10/12 (83.3)\ncSSTI 3/4 (75.0) 5/7 (71.4) 2/4 (50.0)\nOverall 9/10 (90.0) 8/13 (62.0 %) 12/16 (75.0)\n\nEfficacy data above shown should be viewed with caution as concomitant antibiotics were allowed in \nthis study. In addition, the small number of patients should also be taken into consideration. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nTigecycline is administered intravenously and therefore has 100 % bioavailability.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe in vitro plasma protein binding of tigecycline ranges from approximately 71 % to 89 % at \nconcentrations observed in clinical studies (0.1 to 1.0 mcg/ml). Animal and human pharmacokinetic \nstudies have demonstrated that tigecycline readily distributes to tissues.\nIn rats receiving single or multiple doses of 14C-tigecycline, radioactivity was well distributed to most \ntissues, with the highest overall exposure observed in bone marrow, salivary glands, thyroid gland, \nspleen, and kidney. In humans, the steady-state volume of distribution of tigecycline averaged 500 to \n700 L (7 to 9 L/kg), indicating that tigecycline is extensively distributed beyond the plasma volume \nand concentrates into tissues.\n\nNo data are available on whether tigecycline can cross the blood-brain barrier in humans.\nIn clinical pharmacology studies using the therapeutic dosage regimen of 100 mg followed by 50 mg \nq12h, serum tigecycline steady-state Cmax was 866±233 ng/ml for 30-minute infusions and 634±97 \nng/ml for 60-minute infusions. The steady-state AUC0-12h was 2349±850 ng•h/ml.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nOn average, it is estimated that less than 20 % of tigecycline is metabolised before excretion. In \nhealthy male volunteers, following the administration of 14C-tigecycline, unchanged tigecycline was \nthe primary 14C-labelled material recovered in urine and faeces, but a glucuronide, an N-acetyl \nmetabolite and a tigecycline epimer were also present.\n\n\n\n13\n\nIn vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tigecycline does not inhibit metabolism \nmediated by any of the following 6 cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms: 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, \nand 3A4 by competitive inhibition. In addition, tigecycline did not show NADPH-dependency in the \ninhibition of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A, suggesting the absence of mechanism-based \ninhibition of these CYP enzymes. \n\nElimination\n\nThe recovery of the total radioactivity in faeces and urine following administration of 14C-tigecycline\nindicates that 59 % of the dose is eliminated by biliary/faecal excretion, and 33 % is excreted in urine. \nOverall, the primary route of elimination for tigecycline is biliary excretion of unchanged tigecycline. \nGlucuronidation and renal excretion of unchanged tigecycline are secondary routes.\n\nThe total clearance of tigecycline is 24 L/h after intravenous infusion. Renal clearance is \napproximately 13 % of total clearance. Tigecycline shows a polyexponential elimination from serum \nwith a mean terminal elimination half-life after multiple doses of 42 hours although high \ninterindividual variability exists.\n\nIn vitro studies using Caco-2 cells indicate that tigecycline does not inhibit digoxin flux, suggesting \nthat tigecycline is not a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor. This in vitro information is consistent with \nthe lack of effect of tigecycline on digoxin clearance noted in the in vivo drug interaction study \ndescribed above (see section 4.5).\n\nTigecycline is a substrate of P-gp based on an in vitro study using a cell line overexpressing P-gp. The \npotential contribution of P-gp-mediated transport to the in vivo disposition of tigecycline is not \nknown. Co-administration of P-gp inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole or cyclosporine) or P-gp inducers \n(e.g., rifampicin) could affect the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe single-dose pharmacokinetic disposition of tigecycline was not altered in patients with mild \nhepatic impairment. However, systemic clearance of tigecycline was reduced by 25 % and 55 % and \nthe half-life of tigecycline was prolonged by 23 % and 43 % in patients with moderate or severe \nhepatic impairment (Child Pugh B and C), respectively (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe single dose pharmacokinetic disposition of tigecycline was not altered in patients with renal \ninsufficiency (creatinine clearance 30 ml/min, n=6). In severe renal impairment, AUC was 30 % \nhigher than in subjects with normal renal function (see section 4.2).\n\nElderly\nNo overall differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between healthy elderly subjects and \nyounger subjects (see section 4.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nTigecycline pharmacokinetics was investigated in two studies. The first study enrolled children aged \n8-16 years (n=24) who received single doses of tigecycline (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose \nof 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg, respectively) administered intravenously over 30 minutes. The second \nstudy was performed in children aged 8 to 11 years who received multiple doses of tigecycline (0.75, \n1, or 1.25 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 50 mg) every 12 hours administered intravenously over 30 \nminutes. No loading dose was administered in these studies. Pharmacokinetic parameters are \nsummarised in the table below.\n\n\n\n14\n\nDose Normalized to 1 mg/kg Mean ± SD Tigecycline Cmax and AUC in Children\nAge (yr) N Cmax (ng/mL) AUC (ng•h/mL)*\n\nSingle dose\n8 – 11 8 3881 ± 6637 4034 ± 2874\n12 - 16 16 8508 ± 11433 7026 ± 4088\n\nMultiple dose\n8 - 11 42 1911 ± 3032 2404 ± 1000\n\n* single dose AUC0-∞, multiple dose AUC0-12h\n\nThe target AUC0-12h in adults after the recommended dose of 100 mg loading and 50 mg every 12 \nhours, was approximately 2500 ng•h/mL.\n\nPopulation PK analysis of both studies identified body weight as a covariate of tigecycline clearance \nin children aged 8 years and older. A dosing regimen of 1.2 mg/kg of tigecycline every 12 hours (to a \nmaximum dose of 50 mg every 12 hours) for children aged 8 to <12 years and of 50 mg every \n12 hours for adolescents aged 12 to <18 years would likely result in exposures comparable to those \nobserved in adults treated with the approved dosing regimen.\n\nHigher Cmax values than in adult patients were observed in several children in these studies. As a \nconsequence, care should be paid to the rate of infusion of tigecycline in children and adolescents. \n\nGender\nThere were no clinically relevant differences in the clearance of tigecycline between men and women. \nAUC was estimated to be 20 % higher in females than in males.\n\nRace\nThere were no differences in the clearance of tigecycline based on race.\n\nWeight\nClearance, weight-normalised clearance, and AUC were not appreciably different among patients with \ndifferent body weights, including those weighing ≥125 kg. AUC was 24 % lower in patients weighing\n≥125 kg. No data is available for patients weighing 140 kg and more.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, lymphoid depletion/atrophy of lymph nodes, spleen \nand thymus, decreased erythrocytes, reticulocytes, leukocytes, and platelets, in association with bone \nmarrow hypocellularity, and adverse renal and gastrointestinal effects have been seen with tigecycline \nat exposures of 8 and 10 times the human daily dose based on AUC in rats and dogs, respectively. \nThese alterations were shown to be reversible after two weeks of dosing.\n\nBone discolouring was observed in rats which was not reversible after two weeks of dosing.\n\nResults of animal studies indicate that tigecycline crosses the placenta and is found in foetal tissues. \nIn reproduction toxicity studies, decreased foetal weights in rats and rabbits (with associated delays in \nossification) and foetal loss in rabbits have been observed with tigecycline. Tigecycline was not \nteratogenic in the rat or rabbit. Tigecycline did not affect mating or fertility in rats at exposures up to \n4.7 times the human daily dose based on AUC. In female rats, there were no compound-related effects \non ovaries or oestrus cycles at exposures up to 4.7 times the human daily dose based on AUC.\n\nResults from animal studies using 14C-labelled tigecycline indicate that tigecycline is excreted readily \nvia the milk of lactating rats. Consistent with the limited oral bioavailability of tigecycline, there is \nlittle or no systemic exposure to tigecycline in the nursing pups as a result of exposure via maternal \nmilk.\n\n\n\n15\n\nLifetime studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of tigecycline have not been \nperformed, but short-term genotoxicity studies of tigecycline were negative. \n\nBolus intravenous administration of tigecycline has been associated with a histamine response in\nanimal studies. These effects were observed at exposures of 14 and 3 times the human daily dose \nbased on the AUC in rats and dogs respectively.\n\nNo evidence of photosensitivity was observed in rats following administration of tigecycline.\n\n6.

What Tygacil is and what it is used for\n\nTygacil is an antibiotic of the glycylcycline group that works by stopping the growth of bacteria that \ncause infections.\n\nYour doctor has prescribed Tygacil because you or your child at least 8 years old has one of the \nfollowing types of serious infections:\n\n Complicated infection of the skin and soft tissues (the tissue below the skin), excluding diabetic \nfoot infections.\n\n Complicated infection in the abdomen\n\nTygacil is only used when your doctor thinks other antibiotics are not suitable.\n\n2. What you need to know before you receive Tygacil\n\nDo not use Tygacil\n If you are allergic to tigecycline, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you are allergic to tetracycline class antibiotics (e.g., minocycline, doxycycline, \netc.), you may be allergic to tigecycline.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Tygacil:\n If you have poor or slow wound healing.\n If you are suffering from diarrhoea before you are given Tygacil. If you develop diarrhoea \n\nduring or after your treatment, tell your doctor at once. Do not take any diarrhoea medicine \nwithout first checking with your doctor. \n\n\n\n26\n\n If you have or previously had any side effects due to antibiotics belonging to the tetracycline \nclass (e.g., skin sensitization to sun light, staining on developing teeth, pancreas inflammation, \nand alteration of certain laboratory values aimed at measuring how well your blood clots).\n\n If you have, or previously had liver problems. Depending on the condition of your liver, your \ndoctor may reduce the dose to avoid potential side effects.\n\n If you have blockage of the bile ducts (cholestasis).\n If you suffer from a bleeding disorder or are in treatment with anticoagulant drugs, as this\n\nmedicine can interfere with blood coagulation.\n\nDuring treatment with Tygacil:\n Tell your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n Tell your doctor immediately if you develop severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThese may be symptoms of acute pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas which may result in severe \nabdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting).\n\n In certain serious infections, your doctor may consider to use Tygacil in combination with other \nantibiotics.\n\n Your doctor will monitor you closely for the development of any other bacterial infections. If \nyou develop another bacterial infection, your doctor may prescribe a different antibiotic \nspecific for the type of infection present.\n\n Although antibiotics including Tygacil fight certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may \ncontinue to grow. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any \npotential infections and treat you if necessary.\n\nChildren\nTygacil is not to be used in children less than 8 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and \nefficacy in this age group and because it may induce permanent dental defects such as staining on the \ndeveloping teeth.\n\nOther medicines and Tygacil\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nTygacil may prolong certain tests that measure how well your blood is clotting. It is important that \nyou tell your doctor if you are taking medicines to avoid an excess of blood clotting (named \nanticoagulants). If this were the case, your doctor will monitor you closely.\n\nTygacil may interfere with the contraceptive pill (birth control pill). Talk to your doctor about the \nneed for an additional method of contraception while receiving Tygacil.\n\nTygacil may increase the effect of medicines used to suppress the immune system (such as tacrolimus \nor cyclosporine). It is important that you tell your doctor if you are taking these medicines so you can \nbe closely monitored.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTygacil may cause foetal harm. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or \nare planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before receiving Tygacil.\n\nIt is not known if Tygacil passes into breast milk in humans. Ask your doctor for advice before \nbreast-feeding your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nTygacil may cause side effects such as dizziness. This may impair your ability to drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\n\n\n27\n\nTygacil contains sodium\nTygacil contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 ml of suspension, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n3. How Tygacil is given\n\nTygacil will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse.\n\nThe recommended dose in adults is 100 mg given initially, followed by 50 mg every 12 hours. This \ndose is given intravenously (directly into your blood stream) over a period of 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nThe recommended dose in children aged 8 to <12 years is 1.2 mg/kg given every 12 hours \nintravenously to a maximum dose of 50 mg every 12 hours.\n\nThe recommended dose in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years is 50 mg given every 12 hours.\n\nA course of treatment usually lasts for 5 to 14 days. Your doctor will decide how long you should be \ntreated.\n\nIf you receive more Tygacil than you should\nIf you are concerned that you may have been given too much Tygacil, talk to your doctor or nurse \nimmediately.\n\nIf you miss a dose of Tygacil\nIf you are concerned that you may have missed a dose, talk to your doctor or nurse immediately.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nPseudomembranous colitis may occur with most antibiotics including Tygacil.

How Tygacil is given in this leaflet)\n\nThe powder should be reconstituted with 5.3 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for \ninjection, dextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection, or Lactated Ringer’s solution for injection\nto achieve a concentration of 10 mg/ml of tigecycline. The vial should be gently swirled until the \nactive substance is dissolved. Thereafter, 5 ml of the reconstituted solution should be immediately \nwithdrawn from the vial and added to a 100 ml intravenous bag for infusion or other suitable infusion \ncontainer (e.g. glass bottle).\n\nFor a 100 mg dose, reconstitute using two vials into a 100 ml intravenous bag for infusion or other \nsuitable infusion container (e.g. glass bottle).\n\nNote: The vial contains a 6 % overage. Thus, 5 ml of reconstituted solution is equivalent to 50 mg of \nthe active substance. The reconstituted solution should be yellow to orange in colour; if not, the \nsolution should be discarded. Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter \nand discolouration (e.g. green or black) prior to administration.\n\nTigecycline should be administered intravenously through a dedicated line or through a Y-site. If the \nsame intravenous line is used for sequential infusion of several active substances, the line should be \nflushed before and after infusion of tigecycline with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution \nfor injection or dextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection. Injection should be made with an \ninfusion solution compatible with tigecycline and any other medicinal product(s) via this common \nline.\n\nCompatible intravenous solutions include: sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection, \ndextrose 50 mg/ml (5 %) solution for injection, and Lactated Ringer’s solution for injection.\n\nWhen administered through a Y-site, compatibility of tigecycline diluted in sodium chloride 0.9 % for \ninjection is demonstrated with the following medicinal products or diluents: amikacin, dobutamine, \ndopamine HCl, gentamicin, haloperidol, Lactated Ringer’s, lidocaine HCl, metoclopramide, \nmorphine, norepinephrine, piperacillin/tazobactam (EDTA formulation), potassium chloride, \npropofol, ranitidine HCl, theophylline, and tobramycin.\n\nTygacil must not be mixed with other medicinal products for which compatibility data are not \navailable.\n\nOnce reconstituted and diluted in the bag or other suitable infusion container (e.g. glass bottle) \ntigecycline should be used immediately.\n\nFor single use only, any unused solution should be discarded.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
