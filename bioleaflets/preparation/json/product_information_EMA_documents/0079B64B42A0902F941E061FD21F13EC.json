See also sections 4.4 and 4.8 \nb.  Toxicity should be graded with the current version of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology \n\nCriteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE). \n \nPatient Alert Card \n \nAll prescribers of LIBTAYO should be familiar with the educational materials and inform the patients \nabout the Patient Alert Card explaining what to do should they experience any symptom of immune-\n\n\n\n \n\n 6  \n\nrelated adverse reactions and infusion-related reactions. The physician will provide the Patient Alert \nCard to each patient. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of LIBTAYO in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients. Cemiplimab exposure is similar across all \nage groups (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of LIBTAYO is recommended for patients with renal impairment. There are \nlimited data for LIBTAYO in patients with severe renal impairment CLcr 15 to 29 ml/min (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. LIBTAYO has not \nbeen studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. There are insufficient data in \npatients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment for dosing recommendations (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nLIBTAYO is for intravenous use. It is administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes through \nan intravenous line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding, in-line or add-on filter \n(0.2 micron to 5 micron pore size). \n \nOther medicinal products should not be co-administered through the same infusion line. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nImmune-related adverse reactions \nSevere and fatal immune-related adverse reactions have been observed with cemiplimab (see \nsection 4.2 and section 4.8). These immune-related reactions may involve any organ system. Most \nimmune-related reactions initially manifest during treatment with cemiplimab; however, \nimmune-related adverse reactions can occur after discontinuation of cemiplimab. \n\nImmune-related adverse reactions affecting more than one body system can occur simultaneously, \nsuch as myositis and myocarditis or myasthenia gravis, in patients treated with cemiplimab or other \nPD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. \n\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of immune-related adverse reactions. Immune-related \nadverse reactions should be managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications, hormone replacement \ntherapy (if clinically indicated), and corticosteroids. For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, \npatients should be evaluated to confirm an immune-related adverse reaction and to exclude other \n\n\n\n \n\n 7  \n\npossible causes, including infection. Depending upon the severity of the adverse reaction, cemiplimab \nshould be withheld or permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). \n\nImmune-related pneumonitis \nImmune-related pneumonitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate \naetiology, including fatal cases, has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and causes other than immune-\nrelated pneumonitis should be ruled out. Patients with suspected pneumonitis should be evaluated with \nradiographic imaging as indicated based on clinical evaluation and managed with cemiplimab \ntreatment modifications and corticosteroids. (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related colitis \nImmune-related diarrhoea or colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate \naetiology, has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of diarrhoea or colitis and managed with cemiplimab treatment \nmodifications, anti-diarrhoeal agents, and corticosteroids (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related hepatitis \nImmune-related hepatitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate aetiology, \nincluding fatal cases, has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment as indicated \nbased on clinical evaluation and managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids \n(see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related endocrinopathies \nImmune-related endocrinopathies, defined as treatment-emergent endocrinopathies with no clear \nalternate aetiology, have been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). \n \nThyroid disorders (Hypothyroidism/Hyperthyroidism) \nImmune-related thyroid disorders have been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab. Thyroid \ndisorders can occur at any time during the treatment. Patients should be monitored for changes in \nthyroid function at the start of treatment and periodically during the treatment as indicated based on \nclinical evaluation (see section 4.8). Patients should be managed with hormone replacement therapy (if \nindicated) and cemiplimab treatment modifications. Hyperthyroidism should be managed according to \nstandard medical practice (see section 4.2). \n \nHypophysitis \nImmune-related hypophysitis has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis and managed with cemiplimab \ntreatment modifications, corticosteroids and hormone replacement, as clinically indicated (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nAdrenal insufficiency \nAdrenal insufficiency has been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during and after treatment and \nmanaged with cemiplimab treatment modifications, corticosteroids and hormone replacement, as \nclinically indicated (see section 4.2). \n \nType 1 Diabetes mellitus \nImmune-related type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has been observed in patients \nreceiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia and signs \nand symptoms of diabetes as indicated based on clinical evaluation and managed with oral \nanti-hyperglycaemics or insulin and cemiplimab treatment modifications (see section 4.2).  \n \nImmune-related skin adverse reactions \nImmune-related skin adverse reactions, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids with no \nclear alternate aetiology, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), such as \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal \n\n\n\n \n\n 8  \n\noutcome), and other skin reactions such as rash, erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, have been reported \nin association with cemiplimab treatment (see section 4.8).  \n \nPatients should be monitored for evidence of suspected severe skin reactions and exclude other causes. \nPatients should be managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see \nsection 4.2). For symptoms or signs of SJS or TEN, refer the patient for specialised care for \nassessment and treatment and manage patient with treatment modifications (see section 4.2). \n \nCases of SJS, fatal TEN and stomatitis occurred following 1 dose of cemiplimab in patients with prior \nexposure to idelalisib, who were participating in a clinical trial evaluating cemiplimab in Non-Hodgkin \nLymphoma (NHL), and who had recent exposure to sulfa containing antibiotics (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids as described \nabove (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-related nephritis \nImmune-related nephritis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate aetiology, \nhas been observed in patients receiving cemiplimab (see section 4.8). Monitor patients for changes in \nrenal function. Patients should be managed with cemiplimab treatment modifications and \ncorticosteroids (see section 4.2). \n \nOther immune-related adverse reactions \nOther fatal and life-threatening immune-related adverse reactions have been observed in patients \nreceiving cemiplimab including paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, meningitis and myositis (see \nsection 4.8 for other immune-related adverse reactions). \n \nEvaluate suspected immune-related adverse reactions to exclude other causes. Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related adverse reactions and managed with cemiplimab \ntreatment modifications and corticosteroids as clinically indicated (see section 4.2 and section 4.8). \n \nSolid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with \nPD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with cemiplimab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant \nrecipients. The benefit of treatment with cemiplimab versus the risk of possible organ rejection should \nbe considered in these patients. Cases of graft-versus-host disease have been reported in the post-\nmarketing setting in patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in association with allogeneic \nhematopoietic stem cell transplant. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nCemiplimab can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions and managed with \ncemiplimab treatment modifications and corticosteroids. Cemiplimab should be interrupted or the rate \nof infusion slowed for mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. The infusion should be stopped and \ncemiplimab should be permanently discontinued for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) \ninfusion-related reactions (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients excluded from clinical studies \nPatients that had active infections or that were immunocompromised were not included in the main \nstudy. For a full list of patients excluded from clinical trials, see section 5.1. \n \nIn the absence of data, cemiplimab should be used with caution in these populations after careful \nevaluation of the balance of benefits and risks for the patient. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with cemiplimab. \n \nThe use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting cemiplimab, except for \nphysiological doses of systemic corticosteroid (≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), should be \n\n\n\n \n\n 9  \n\navoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of \ncemiplimab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting \ncemiplimab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with cemiplimab \nand for at least 4 months after the last dose of cemiplimab. \n \nPregnancy \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cemiplimab. There are no available data on \nthe use of cemiplimab in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the \nPD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing \nfoetus resulting in foetal death (see section 5.3).  \n \nHuman IgG4 is known to cross the placental barrier and cemiplimab is an IgG4; therefore, cemiplimab \nhas the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. Cemiplimab is not \nrecommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective \ncontraception unless the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether cemiplimab is secreted in human milk. It is known that antibodies (including \nIgG4) are secreted in human milk; a risk to the breast-feeding newborn/infant cannot be excluded. \n \nIf a woman chooses to be treated with cemiplimab, she should be instructed not to breast-feed while \nbeing treated with cemiplimab and for at least 4 months after the last dose. \n \nFertility \nNo clinical data are available on the possible effects of cemiplimab on fertility. No effects on fertility \nassessment parameters or in the male and female reproductive organs were observed in a 3-month \nrepeat dose fertility assessment study with sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCemiplimab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been \nreported following treatment with cemiplimab (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nImmune-related adverse reactions can occur with cemiplimab. Most of these, including severe \nreactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of cemiplimab \n(see “Description of selected adverse reactions” below). \n \nThe safety of cemiplimab has been evaluated in 591 patients with advanced solid malignancies \nincluding 219 advanced CSCC patients who received cemiplimab monotherapy in 2 clinical studies \n(R2810-ONC-1423 and R2810-ONC-1540). Of these 219 patients, 131 patients had mCSCC (nodal or \ndistant) and 88 patients had laCSCC. Immune-related adverse reactions occurred in 20.3% of patients \ntreated with cemiplimab in clinical trials including Grade 5 (0.7%), Grade 4 (1.2%) and Grade 3 \n(6.3%). Immune-related adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 4.4% of \npatients. The most common immune-related adverse reactions were hypothyroidism (7.1%), \npneumonitis (3.7%), cutaneous adverse reactions (2.0%), hyperthyroidism (1.9%) and hepatitis (1.9%) \n(see “Description of selected adverse reactions” below, Special warnings and precautions for use in \nsection 4.4 and Recommended treatment modifications in section 4.2). Adverse reactions were serious \nin 8.6% of patients and led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 5.8% of patients. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 10  \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in association with cemiplimab treatment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nListed in Table 2 are adverse reactions by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available \ndata).

Immune-related pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in \n11 (1.9%) of 591 patients. Among the 22 patients with immune-related pneumonitis, the median time \nto onset was 3.8 months (range: 7 days to 18 months) and the median duration of pneumonitis was \n21.5 days (range: 5 days to 6.5 months). Eighteen patients (3.0%) received high-dose corticosteroids \nfor a median of 8.5 days (range: 1 day to 5.9 months). Resolution of pneumonitis had occurred in \n14 (63.6%) of the 22 patients at the time of data cut-off. \n \nImmune-related colitis \nImmune-related diarrhoea or colitis occurred in 7 (1.2%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab \nincluding 2 (0.3%) with Grade 3 immune-related diarrhoea or colitis. Immune-related diarrhoea or \ncolitis led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 1 (0.2%) of 591 patients. Among the \n7 patients with immune-related diarrhoea or colitis, the median time to onset was 3.8 months \n(range: 15 days to 6.0 months) and the median duration of immune-related diarrhoea or colitis was \n30 days (range: 4 days to 8.6 months). Four patients (0.7%) with immune-related diarrhoea or colitis \nreceived high-dose corticosteroids for a median of 29 days (range: 19 days to 2.0 months). Resolution \nof immune-related diarrhoea or colitis had occurred in 4 (57.1%) of the 7 patients at the time of data \ncut-off. \n \nImmune-related hepatitis \nImmune-related hepatitis occurred in 11 (1.9%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including \n1 (0.2%) patient with Grade 5, 1 (0.2%) patient with Grade 4, and 9 (1.5%) patients with Grade 3 \nimmune-related hepatitis. Immune-related hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in \n5 (0.8%) of 591 patients. Among the 11 patients with immune-related hepatitis, the median time to \nonset was 1.0 month (range: 7 days to 4.2 months) and the median duration of hepatitis was 15 days \n(range: 8 days to 2.7 months). Ten (1.7%) patients with immune-related hepatitis received high-dose \ncorticosteroids for a median of 10.5 days (range: 2 days to 1.9 months). Resolution of hepatitis had \noccurred in 8 (72.7%) of the 11 patients at the time of data cut-off. \n \nImmune-related endocrinopathies \nHypothyroidism occurred in 42 (7.1%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including \n1 (0.2%) patient with Grade 3 hypothyroidism. No patient discontinued cemiplimab due to \nhypothyroidism. Among the 42 patients with hypothyroidism, the median time to onset was \n4.2 months (range: 15 days to 18.9 months). \n \nHyperthyroidism occurred in 11 (1.9%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including \n1 (0.2%) patient with Grade 3 hyperthyroidism. No patient discontinued cemiplimab due to \nhyperthyroidism. Among the 11 patients with hyperthyroidism, the median time to onset was \n1.9 months (range: 28 days to 14.8 months).  \n \nAdrenal insufficiency occurred in 3 (0.5%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including \n1 (0.2%) patient with Grade 3 adrenal insufficiency. No patient discontinued cemiplimab due to \nadrenal insufficiency. Among the 3 patients with adrenal insufficiency, the median time to onset was \n11.5 months (range: 10.4 months to 12.3 months). One of the 3 patients was treated with systemic \ncorticosteroids.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 13  \n\nImmune-related hypophysitis occurred in 1 (0.2%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab. The event \nwas Grade 3 hypophysitis. \n \nType 1 diabetes mellitus without an alternative aetiology occurred in 4 (0.7%) of 591 patients \nincluding 3 (0.5%) patients with Grade 4 and 1 (0.2%) patient with Grade 3 type 1 diabetes mellitus. \nType 1 diabetes mellitus led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 1 (0.2%) of 591 patients. \nAmong the 4 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the median time to onset was 2.3 months \n(range: 28 days to 6.2 months). \n \nImmune-related skin adverse reactions \nImmune-related skin adverse reactions occurred in 12 (2.0%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab \nincluding 6 (1.0%) patients with Grade 3 immune-related skin adverse reactions. Immune-related skin \nadverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab in 2 (0.3%) of 591 patients. Among \nthe 12 patients with immune-related skin adverse reactions, the median time to onset was 1.5 months \n(range: 2 days to 10.9 months) and the median duration was 4.4 months (range: 14 days to \n9.6 months). Nine patients (1.5%) with immune-related skin adverse reactions received high-dose \ncorticosteroids for a median of 16 days (range: 7 days to 2.6 months). Resolution had occurred in \n6 (50%) of 12 patients at the time of data cut-off. \n \nImmune-related nephritis \nImmune-related nephritis occurred in 3 (0.5%) of 591 patients receiving cemiplimab including \n2 (0.3%) patients with Grade 3 immune-related nephritis. Immune-related nephritis led to permanent \ndiscontinuation of cemiplimab in 1 (0.2%) of 591 patients. Among the 3 patients with immune-related \nnephritis, the median time to onset was 1.8 months (range: 29 days to 4.1 months) and the median \nduration of nephritis was 18 days (range: 9 days to 29 days). Two (0.3%) patients with immune-related \nnephritis received high-dose corticosteroids for a median of 1.5 months (range: 16 days to 2.6 months). \nResolution of nephritis had occurred in all patients at the time of data cut-off. \n \nOther immune-related adverse reactions \nThe following clinically significant, immune-related adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less \nthan 1% of 591 (unless otherwise specified) patients treated with cemiplimab. The events were \nGrade 3 or less unless stated otherwise: \n \nNervous system disorders: Meningitisa (Grade 4), paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (Grade 5), \nGuillain-Barre syndrome, central nervous system inflammation, chronic inflammatory demyelinating \npolyradiculoneuropathy, encephalitisb, myasthenia gravis, neuropathy peripheralc. \nCardiac Disorders: Myocarditisd, pericarditise \nImmune system disorders: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura \nVascular disorders: Vasculitis \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Arthralgia (1.4%), arthritisf, muscular weakness, \nmyalgia, polymyalgia rheumatica, Sjogren’s syndrome \nEye disorders: Keratitis \nGastrointestinal disorders: Stomatitis \nEndocrine: Thyroiditis \na. includes meningitis and meningitis aseptic \nb. includes encephalitis and noninfective encephalitis \nc. includes neuritis and neuropathy peripheral \nd. includes autoimmune myocarditis and myocarditis \ne. includes autoimmune pericarditis and pericarditis \nf. includes arthritis and polyarthritis \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nInfusion-related reactions occurred in 54 (9.1%) of 591 patients treated with cemiplimab including \n1 (0.2%) patient with Grade 3 infusion-related reaction. Infusion-related reaction led to permanent \ndiscontinuation of cemiplimab in 2 (0.3%) patients. The most common symptoms of infusion-related \nreaction were nausea, pyrexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, chills and flushing. All patients recovered \nfrom the infusion-related reaction. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 14  \n\nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with cemiplimab. \nApproximately 1.1% of patients administered cemiplimab developed treatment-emergent antibodies, \nwith approximately 0.2% exhibiting persistent antibody responses. No neutralizing antibodies have \nbeen observed. There was no evidence of an altered PK or safety profile with anti-cemiplimab \nantibody development. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, \nand appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC33 \n \nMechanism of action \nCemiplimab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the \nprogrammed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and \nPD-L2. Engagement of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed by antigen \npresenting cells and may be expressed by tumour cells and/or other cells in the tumour \nmicroenvironment, results in inhibition of T cell function such as proliferation, cytokine secretion, and \ncytotoxic activity. Cemiplimab potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through \nblockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy and safety of cemiplimab in patients with mCSCC (nodal or distant) or laCSCC who \nwere not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation were studied in clinical trial \nR2810-ONC-1540 (Study 1540). Study 1540 was a phase 2, open-label, multi-centre study that  \nenrolled 193 patients with mCSCC or laCSCC with a combined median follow-up time of 9.4 months \ntotal. Median duration of follow-up was 16.5 months for the mCSCC 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) \ngroup, 9.3 months for the laCSCC 3 mg/kg Q2W group and 8.1 months for the mCSCC 350 mg Q3W \ngroup. \n \nPatients with any of the following were excluded: autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy \nwith immunosuppressant agents within 5 years; history of solid organ transplant; history of \npneumonitis within the last 5 years; prior treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or other immune checkpoint \ninhibitor therapy; active infection requiring therapy, including known infection with human \nimmunodeficiency virus, or active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus; chronic lymphocytic \nleukaemia (CLL); brain metastases or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance \nscore (PS) ≥ 2. \n \nIn Study 1540, patients received cemiplimab until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or \ncompletion of planned treatment [3 mg/kg Q2W for 96 weeks or 350 mg Q3W for 54 weeks]. If \npatients with locally advanced disease showed sufficient response to treatment, surgery with curative \nintent was permitted. Tumour response assessments were performed every 8 or 9 weeks (for patients \nreceiving 3 mg/kg Q2W or 350 mg Q3W, respectively). The primary endpoint of Study 1540 was \nconfirmed objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by independent central review (ICR). For \n\n\n\n \n\n 15  \n\npatients with mCSCC without externally visible target lesions, ORR was determined by Response \nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1). For patients with externally visible target lesions \n(laCSCC and mCSCC), ORR was determined by a composite endpoint that integrated ICR \nassessments of radiologic data (RECIST 1.1) and digital medical photography (WHO criteria). The \nkey secondary endpoint was duration of response (DOR) by ICR. Other secondary endpoints included \nORR and DOR by investigator assessment (IA), progression free survival (PFS) by ICR and IA, \noverall survival (OS), complete response rate (CR) by ICR, and change in scores in patient reported \noutcomes on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of \nLife Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). \n \nResults are presented from 193 patients in Study 1540. Of these 193 patients, 115 had mCSCC and \n78 had laCSCC. The median age was 72 years (range: 38 to 96): Seventy-eight (40.4%) patients were \n75 years or older, 66 patients (34.2%) were 65 to less than 75 years, and 49 patients (25.4%) were less \nthan 65 years. A total of 161 (83.4 %) patients were male, and 187 (96.9%) patients were White; the \nECOG PS was 0 (44.6%) and 1 (55.4%). Thirty-three and 7/10 per cent (33.7%) of patients had \nreceived at least 1 prior anti-cancer systemic therapy, 90.2% of patients had received prior cancer \nrelated surgery, and 67.9% of patients had received prior radiotherapy.

Based on Kaplan Meier estimates. \n \n\nEfficacy and PD-L1 status \nClinical activity was observed regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression status. The relationship between \nPD-L1 status and efficacy was analysed post-hoc in patients with available tissue samples. Overall in \nStudies 1423 and 1540, PD-L1 IHC results were available for 75 advanced CSCC patients. Among \n22 advanced CSCC patients with PD-L1 < 1%, ORR per ICR was 40.9% (9/22). Among 53 advanced \nCSCC patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1%, ORR was 54.7% (29/53). Among 21 mCSCC patients, ORR was \n60% (3/5) in patients with PD-L1 < 1% and 56.3% (9/16) among patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1%. Among \n54 patients with laCSCC, ORR was 35.3% (6/17) in patients with PD-L1 < 1% and 54.1% (20/37) \namong patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1%. \n \nElderly population \nOf the 219 patients with mCSCC and laCSCC treated with cemiplimab, 25.1% (55/219) were less than \n65 years, 34.2% (75/219) were 65 to less than 75 years, and 40.6% (89/219) were 75 years or older. \nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger \nsubjects. \n \nIn the 193 patients in the efficacy analysis, the ORR by ICR (95% CI) was 40.8% (27.0%, 55.8%) in \npatients less than 65 years, 48.5% (36.0%, 61.1%) in patients 65 to less than 75 years, and 43.6% \n(32.4%, 55.3%) in patients 75 years or older. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ncemiplimab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of all conditions included in the \ncategory of malignant neoplasms, except haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nConditional approval \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency \nwill review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be \nupdated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcentration data were collected in 548 patients with various solid tumours, including 178 patients \nwith CSCC, who received cemiplimab. At dosing regimens of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg Q2W and 350 mg \nQ3W, kinetics of cemiplimab were observed to be linear and dose proportional, suggesting saturation \nof the target-mediated pathway over the dosing interval. \n \nIn patients with CSCC, cemiplimab exposure at steady-state at 350 mg Q3W (N=53) and at 3 mg/kg \nQ2W (N=135) is similar. At 350 mg Q3W, the mean cemiplimab concentrations at steady-state ranged \nbetween a Ctrough of 63 mg/l and a concentration at end of infusion (Cmax) of 151 mg/l. Steady-state \nexposure is achieved after approximately 4 months of treatment. \n \nAbsorption \nCemiplimab is administered via the intravenous route and hence is completely bioavailable. \n \nDistribution \nCemiplimab is primarily distributed in the vascular system with a volume of distribution at \nsteady-state (Vss) of 5.2 liters. \n\n\n\n \n\n 17  \n\n \nBiotransformation \nSpecific metabolism studies were not conducted because cemiplimab is a protein. Cemiplimab is \nexpected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. \n \nElimination \nClearance of cemiplimab is linear at doses of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every two weeks. Cemiplimab \nclearance after the first dose is approximately 0.33 l/day. The total clearance appears to decrease by \napproximately 35% over time, resulting in a steady state clearance (CLss) of 0.21 l/day; the decrease \nin CL is not considered clinically relevant. The within dosing interval half-life at steady state is \n19.4 days. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nAt the dosing regimens of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg every two weeks, kinetics of cemiplimab were \nobserved to be linear and dose proportional, suggesting saturation of the target-mediated pathway. \n \nSpecial populations \nA population PK analysis suggests that the following factors have no clinically significant effect on \nthe exposure of cemiplimab: age, gender, body weight, race, cancer type, albumin level, mild hepatic \nimpairment and renal impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe effect of renal impairment on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated by a population PK \nanalysis in patients with mild (CLcr 60 to 89 ml/min; n= 197), moderate (CLcr 30 to 59 ml/min; \nn= 90), or severe (CLcr 15 to 29 ml/min; n= 4) renal impairment. No clinically important differences \nin the exposure of cemiplimab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with \nnormal renal function. Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients with CLcr <25 ml/min (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of cemiplimab was evaluated by population PK \nanalysis. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (n= 5) (total bilirubin [TB] greater than 1.0 to \n1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] and any aspartate aminotransferase [AST]); no clinically \nimportant differences in the exposure of cemiplimab were found compared to patients with normal \nhepatic function. Cemiplimab has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment. There are insufficient data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment for \ndosing recommendations (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo studies have been performed to test the potential of cemiplimab for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cemiplimab (see section 4.6). As reported \nin the literature, PD-1 / PD-L1 signalling pathway plays a role in sustaining pregnancy by maintaining \nimmunological tolerance and studies have shown that PD-1 receptor blockade results in early \ntermination of pregnancy. The increase of spontaneous abortion and/or resorption in animals with \nrestricted PD-L1 expression (knock-out or anti-PD1 / PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies) has been shown \nin both mice and monkeys. These animal species have similar maternal-foetal interface to that in \nhumans. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you use LIBTAYO  \n3. How you are given LIBTAYO \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store LIBTAYO  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n1. What LIBTAYO is and what it is used for \n \nLIBTAYO is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance cemiplimab, which is a \nmonoclonal antibody. \n \nLIBTAYO is used in adults to treat a type of skin cancer called advanced cutaneous squamous cell \ncarcinoma or CSCC.  \n \nLIBTAYO works by helping your immune system fight your cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given LIBTAYO \n \nYou should not be given LIBTAYO if: \n\n you are allergic to cemiplimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\nIf you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor before you are given \nLIBTAYO. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given LIBTAYO if:  \n\n you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells) \n you have had an organ transplant, or you have received or plan to receive a bone marrow \n\ntransplant using bone marrow from another person (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant) \n\n\n\n \n\n 31  \n\n you have lung or breathing problems \n you have liver problems \n you have kidney problems \n you have diabetes \n you have any other medical conditions. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you, or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given \nLIBTAYO. \n \nLook out for side effects \nLIBTAYO can cause some serious side effects that you need to tell your doctor about immediately. \nThese problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended. You \nmay have more than one side effect at the same time. \nThese serious side effects include: \n\n Skin problems  \n Lung problems (pneumonitis)  \n Gut problems (colitis)  \n Liver problems (hepatitis)  \n Hormone gland problems - especially thyroid, pituitary, adrenal glands and the pancreas \n Type 1 diabetes \n Kidney problems (nephritis and kidney failure) \n Central nervous system problems (such as meningitis) \n Infusion-related reactions  \n Problems in other parts of the body (see ‘Possible side effects’) \n Muscle problems (inflammation of the muscles called myositis). \n\n \nLook out for these side effects while you are receiving LIBTAYO. See ‘Possible side effects’ section \nin section 4. If you have any of these effects, talk to your doctor immediately.  \nYour doctor may give you other medicines in order to stop more severe reactions and reduce your \nsymptoms. Your doctor also may delay your next dose of LIBTAYO or stop your treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nLIBTAYO should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and LIBTAYO \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking or have ever taken any of the following medicines: \n\n a cancer medicine called idelalisib \n medicines that make your immune system weak - examples include corticosteroids, such \n\nas prednisone. These medicines may interfere with the effect of LIBTAYO. However, \nonce you are treated with LIBTAYO, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to reduce \nthe side effects that you may have with LIBTAYO.  \n\n \nPregnancy  \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before you are given this medicine. \n\n LIBTAYO can harm your unborn baby. \n Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are being treated with \n\nLIBTAYO. \n If you are able to become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception to \n\navoid becoming pregnant: \n while you are being treated with LIBTAYO and \n for at least 4 months after the last dose. \n\n Talk to your doctor about the contraception methods that you must use during this time. \n\n\n\n \n\n 32  \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n\n If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before you are \ngiven this medicine.  \n\n Do not breast-feed while you are being treated with LIBTAYO and for at least 4 months \nafter the last dose.  \n\n It is not known if LIBTAYO passes into your breast milk.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nLIBTAYO has no or minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines.
