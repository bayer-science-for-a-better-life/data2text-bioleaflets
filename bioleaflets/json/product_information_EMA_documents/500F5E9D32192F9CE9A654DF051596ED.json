This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nUltomiris 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of 30 mL contains 300 mg of ravulizumab, produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell \nculture by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nAfter dilution, the final concentration of the solution to be infused is 5 mg/mL. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \nSodium (5 mmol per vial) \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \nClear to translucent, slight whitish colour, pH 7.0 solution.  \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nUltomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria \n(PNH): \n- in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity.  \n- in patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the \n\npast 6 months (see section 5.1). \n \nUltomiris is indicated in the treatment of patients with a body weight of 10 kg or above with atypical \nhaemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received \neculizumab for at least 3 months and have evidence of response to eculizumab (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRavulizumab must be administered by a healthcare professional and under the supervision of a \nphysician experienced in the management of patients with haematological or renal disorders. \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with PNH and aHUS \nThe recommended dosing regimen consists of a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing, \nadministered by intravenous infusion. The doses to be administered are based on the patient’s body \nweight, as shown in Table 1. For adult patients (≥ 18 years of age), maintenance doses should be \nadministered at a once every 8-week interval, starting 2 weeks after loading dose administration. \n \nDosing schedule is allowed to occasionally vary by ± 7 days of the scheduled infusion day (except for \nthe first maintenance dose of ravulizumab, but the subsequent dose should be administered according \nto the original schedule). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nFor patients switching from eculizumab to ravulizumab, the loading dose of ravulizumab should be \nadministered 2 weeks after the last eculizumab infusion, and then maintenance doses are administered \nonce every 8 weeks, starting 2 weeks after loading dose administration, as shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1:  Ravulizumab weight-based dosing regimen \n\nBody weight range (kg) Loading dose (mg) Maintenance dose (mg)* Dosing interval \n≥ 40 to < 60 2,400 3,000 Every 8 weeks \n\n≥ 60 to < 100 2,700 3,300 Every 8 weeks \n≥ 100 3,000 3,600 Every 8 weeks \n\n*Maintenance dose is administered 2 weeks after loading dose \nRavulizumab has not been studied in patients with PNH who weigh less than 40 kg. \n \nThere is no experience of concomitant PE/PI (plasmapheresis or plasma exchange, or fresh frozen \nplasma infusion) use with ravulizumab. Administration of PE/PI may reduce ravulizumab serum \nlevels.  \n \nPNH is a chronic disease and treatment with ravulizumab is recommended to continue for the patient’s \nlifetime, unless the discontinuation of ravulizumab is clinically indicated (see section 4.4). \n \nIn aHUS, ravulizumab treatment to resolve TMA manifestations should be for a minimum duration of \n6 months, beyond which length of treatment needs to be considered for each patient individually. \nPatients who are at higher risk for TMA recurrence, as determined by the treating healthcare provider \n(or clinically indicated), may require chronic therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population (> 65 years old) \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with PNH and aHUS aged 65 years and over. There is no \nevidence indicating any special precautions are required for treating a geriatric population – although \nexperience with ravulizumab in elderly patients is limited.  \n \nRenal impairment \nIn aHUS clinical trials, patients with renal impairment including on dialysis were included. No dose \nadjustment is required in this population, see section 5.2. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of ravulizumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment; \nhowever pharmacokinetic data suggest that no dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nPaediatric patients with aHUS with body weight ≥ 40 kg are treated in accordance with the adult \ndosing recommendations. The weight-based doses and dosing intervals for paediatric patients ≥ 10 kg \nto < 40 kg is shown in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2:  Ravulizumab weight-based dosing regimen for paediatric patient below 40 kg \n\nBody weight range (kg) Loading dose (mg) Maintenance dose (mg)* Dosing interval \n≥ 10 to < 20 600 600 Every 4 weeks \n≥ 20 to < 30 900 2,100 Every 8 weeks \n≥ 30 to < 40 1200 2,700 Every 8 weeks \n\n*Maintenance dose is administered 2 weeks after loading dose \n \nData to support safety and efficacy of ravulizumab for patients with body weight below 10 kg are \nlimited. Currently available data are described in section 4.8 but no recommendation on a posology \ncan be made for patients below 10 kg body weight.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ravulizumab in children with PNH aged 0 to < 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor intravenous infusion only.  \nUltomiris must be diluted to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL.  \nThis medicinal product must be administered through a 0.2 µm filter and should not be administered \nas an intravenous push or bolus injection.  \n \nUltomiris must be diluted prior to administration by intravenous infusion over a minimal period of \n1.7 to 2.4 hours depending of body weight, see Table 3 below.  \n \nTable 3: Dose administration rate \n\nBody weight \nrange (kg)a \n\nLoading dose \n(mg) \n\nMinimum \ninfusion duration \nminutes (hours) \n\nMaintenance \ndose (mg) \n\nMinimum infusion \nduration \n\nminutes (hours) \n≥ 10 to < 20 600 113 (1.9) 600 113 (1.9) \n≥ 20 to < 30 900 86 (1.5) 2,100 194 (3.3) \n≥ 30 to < 40 1,200 77 (1.3) 2,700 167 (2.8) \n≥ 40 to < 60 2,400 114 (1.9) 3,000 140 (2.4) \n≥ 60 to < 100 2,700 102 (1.7) 3,300 120 (2.0) \n\n≥ 100 3,000 108 (1.8) 3,600 132 (2.2) \na  Body weight at time of treatment. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection at treatment initiation (see section \n\n4.4). \n- Patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis unless they receive \n\nprophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination (see section \n4.4).  \n \n\n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nSerious meningococcal infection \n \nDue to its mechanism of action, the use of ravulizumab increases the patient's susceptibility to \nmeningococcal infection/sepsis (Neisseria meningitidis). Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup \nmay occur. To reduce this risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal \ninfections at least two weeks prior to initiating ravulizumab unless the risk of delaying ravulizumab \ntherapy outweighs the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Patients who initiate ravulizumab \ntreatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine, must receive treatment with \nappropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines against serogroups A, C, \nY, W135 and B where available, are recommended in preventing the commonly pathogenic \nmeningococcal serogroups. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national \nguidelines for vaccination use. If the patient is being switched from eculizumab treatment, physicians \n\n\n\n5 \n\nshould verify that meningococcal vaccination is current according to national guidelines for \nvaccination use. \n \nVaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given \nto official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. Cases of serious meningococcal \ninfections/sepsis have been reported in patients treated with ravulizumab. Cases of serious or fatal \nmeningococcal infections/sepsis have been reported in patients treated with other terminal \ncomplement inhibitors. All patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection \nand sepsis, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and treated with appropriate antibiotics. \nPatients should be informed of these signs and symptoms and steps should be taken to seek medical \ncare immediately. Physicians should provide patients with a patient information brochure and a patient \nsafety card.  \n \nImmunization \n \nPrior to initiating ravulizumab therapy, it is recommended that PNH and aHUS patients initiate \nimmunizations according to current immunization guidelines.  \n \nVaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated \ndiseases, including PNH and aHUS, may experience increased signs and symptoms of their underlying \ndisease, such as haemolysis. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for disease symptoms \nafter recommended vaccination.  \n \nPatients below the age of 18 years old must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and \npneumococcal infections, and strictly need to adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for \neach age group.  \n \nOther systemic infections \n \nRavulizumab therapy should be administered with caution to patients with active systemic infections. \nRavulizumab blocks terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased \nsusceptibility to infections caused by Neisseria species and encapsulated bacteria. Serious infections \nwith Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis), including disseminated gonococcal \ninfections, have been reported. \nPatients should be provided with information from the Package Leaflet to increase their awareness of \npotential serious infections and their signs and symptoms. Physicians should advise patients about \ngonorrhoea prevention.  \n \nInfusion reactions \n \nAdministration of ravulizumab may result in infusion reactions. In clinical trials with PNH and aHUS, \n[(4 out of 296 in patients with PNH) and (4 of 89 patients with aHUS)] patients experienced infusion \nreactions which were mild in severity and transient [e.g., lower back pain, drop in blood pressure, \nelevation in blood pressure, limb discomfort,  drug hypersensitivity (allergic reaction), and dysgeusia \n(bad taste)]. In case of infusion reaction, infusion of ravulizumab should be interrupted and \nappropriate supportive measures should be instituted if signs of cardiovascular instability or \nrespiratory compromise occur.  \n \nTreatment discontinuation for PNH \n \nIf patients with PNH discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be closely monitored for \nsigns and symptoms of serious intravascular haemolysis, identified by elevated LDH (lactate \ndehydrogenase) levels along with sudden decrease in PNH clone size or haemoglobin, or \nre-appearance of symptoms such as fatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath \n(dyspnoea), major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAny patient who discontinues ravulizumab should be monitored for at least 16 weeks to detect \nhaemolysis and other reactions. If signs and symptoms of haemolysis occur after discontinuation, \nincluding elevated LDH, consider restarting treatment with ravulizumab.  \n \nTreatment discontinuation for aHUS \n \nThere are no specific data on ravulizumab discontinuation. In a long-term prospective observational \nstudy, discontinuation of complement C5 inhibitor treatment (eculizumab) resulted in a 13.5-fold \nhigher rate of TMA recurrence and showed a trend toward reduced renal function compared to patients \nwho continued treatment.  \nIf patients must discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they should be monitored closely for signs \nand symptoms of TMA on an on-going basis. However, monitoring may be insufficient to predict or \nprevent severe TMA complications.   \nTMA complications post-discontinuation can be identified if any of the following is observed: \n(i) At least two of the following laboratory results observed concurrently: a decrease in platelet \ncount of 25% or more as compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during ravulizumab \ntreatment; an increase in serum creatinine of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during \nravulizumab treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH of 25% or more as compared to baseline or to \nnadir during ravulizumab treatment (results should be confirmed by a second measurement ) \nOr \n(ii) any one of the following symptoms of TMA: a change in mental status or seizures or other \nextra-renal TMA manifestations including cardiovascular abnormalities, pericarditis, gastrointestinal \nsymptoms/diarrhoea; or thrombosis. \nIf TMA complications occur after ravulizumab discontinuation, consider reinitiation of ravulizumab \ntreatment beginning with the loading dose and maintenance dose described in section 4.2. \n  \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product when diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection \ncontains 2.65 g sodium per 720 mL at the maximal dose, equivalent to 133 % of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \nChronic intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment may interfere with the endosomal \nneonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as ravulizumab and \nthereby decrease serum ravulizumab concentrations.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception methods during treatment and up \nto 8 months after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no clinical data from the use of ravulizumab in pregnant women.  \nNonclinical reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with ravulizumab (see section 5.3).  \nReproductive toxicology studies were conducted in mice using the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1, \nwhich assessed effect of C5 blockade on the reproductive system. No specific test-article related \nreproductive toxicities were identified in these studies. Human IgG are known to cross the human \nplacental barrier, and thus ravulizumab may potentially cause terminal complement inhibition in the \nfoetal circulation.  \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nIn pregnant women the use of ravulizumab may be considered following an assessment of the risks \nand benefits.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ravulizumab is excreted into human milk. Nonclinical reproductive toxicology \nstudies conducted in mice with the murine surrogate molecule BB5.1 identified no adverse effect to \npups resulting from consuming milk from treated dams. \n \nA risk to infants cannot be excluded. \nSince many medicinal products and immunoglobulins are secreted into human milk, and because of \nthe potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nduring treatment with ravulizumab and up to 8 months after treatment.  \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific non-clinical study on fertility has been conducted with ravulizumab. \nNonclinical reproductive toxicology studies conducted in mice with a murine surrogate molecule \n(BB5.1) identified no adverse effect on fertility of the treated females or males.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nUltomiris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse drug reactions (very common frequency) are diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, \nnasopharyngitis and headache. The most serious adverse reactions in patients in clinical trials are \nmeningococcal infection and meningococcal sepsis (see section 4.4).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 4 gives the adverse reactions observed from PNH and aHUS clinical trials.  \nAdverse reactions are listed by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and frequency, using the \nfollowing convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 4:  Adverse reactions  \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class \n\nVery common \n(≥ 1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\nUncommon (≥ \n1/1,000 to < 1/100) \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nUpper respiratory tract \ninfection, Nasopharyngitis \n\n Meningococcal \ninfection* \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Dizziness  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea, Nausea,  Abdominal pain, \nVomiting, Dyspepsia \n\n \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n Rash, Pruritus  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n Arthralgia, Back pain, \nMyalgia, Muscle \n\nspasms \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nPyrexia, Fatigue Influenza like illness, \nAsthenia \n\nChills \n\n* Meningococcal infection includes preferred terms of meningococcal infection and meningococcal sepsis \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMeningococcal infection/sepsis \nVaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infections. In clinical trials, \n3 out of 261 PNH patients developed serious meningococcal infections/sepsis while receiving \ntreatment with ravulizumab; all 3 had been vaccinated. All 3 recovered while continuing treatment \nwith ravulizumab. In aHUS studies, no meningococcal infections occurred among 89 patients \nreceiving treatment with ravulizumab. Please refer to section 4.4 for information on prevention and \ntreatment of suspected meningococcal infection. Meningococcal infections in patients treated with \nravulizumab presented as meningococcal sepsis. Patients should be informed of the signs and \nsymptoms of meningococcal septicaemia and advised to seek medical care immediately. \n \nImmunogenicity \nTreatment with any therapeutic protein may induce an immune response. In PNH patient studies \n(N = 261) and aHUS studies (N=89), only 2 (0.57 %) cases of development of treatment-emergent \nanti-drug antibody have been reported with ravulizumab. These anti-drug antibodies were transient in \nnature with low titre and did not correlate with clinical response or adverse events. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn paediatric patients with evidence of aHUS (aged 10 months to less than 18 years) included in \nALXN1210-aHUS-312 study, the safety profile of ravulizumab appeared similar to that observed in \nadult patients with evidence of aHUS. The safety profiles in the different paediatric subsets of age \nappear similar. The safety data for patient below 2 years of age is limited to four patients. The most \ncommon adverse reaction reported in paediatric patients was pyrexia.   \n \nThe safety of ravulizumab in children with PNH aged 0 to < 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported to date.  \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \nmonitored.  \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: \nL04AA43 \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nRavulizumab is a monoclonal antibody IgG2/4K that specifically binds to the complement protein C5, \nthereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a (the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin) and C5b (the initiating \nsubunit of the terminal complement complex [C5b-9]) and preventing the generation of the C5b-9. \nRavulizumab preserves the early components of complement activation that are essential for \nopsonisation of microorganisms and clearance of immune complexes.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nFollowing ravulizumab treatment in both complement-inhibitor naïve patients and \neculizumab-experienced patients with PNH in Phase 3 studies, immediate and complete inhibition of \nserum free C5 (concentration of < 0.5 µg/mL) was observed by the end of the first infusion and \nsustained throughout the entire 26-week treatment period in all patients. Immediate and complete \ninhibition of serum free C5 was also observed in adult and paediatric patients with aHUS by the end of \nthe first infusion and throughout the 26-week treatment period. \nThe extent and duration of the pharmacodynamic response in patients with PNH and aHUS were \nexposure dependent for ravulizumab. Free C5 levels less than 0.5 µg/mL were correlated with \nmaximal intravascular haemolysis control and complete terminal complement inhibition.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nParoxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria \nThe safety and efficacy of ravulizumab in patients with PNH were assessed in two open-label, \nrandomised, active-controlled Phase 3 trials:  \n- a complement-inhibitor naïve study in adult patients with PNH who were naïve to complement \n\ninhibitor treatment, \n- an eculizumab -experienced study in patients with PNH who were clinically stable after having \n\nbeen treated with eculizumab for at least the previous 6 months. \n \nRavulizumab was dosed in accordance with the recommended dosing described in section 4.2 \n(4 infusions of ravulizumab over 26 weeks) while eculizumab was administered according to the \napproved dosing regimen of eculizumab of 600 mg every week for the first 4 weeks and 900 mg every \n2 weeks (15 infusions over 26 weeks). \nPatients were vaccinated against meningococcal infection prior to or at the time of initiating treatment \nwith ravulizumab or eculizumab, or received prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until \n2 weeks after vaccination.  \nThere were no noteworthy differences in the demographic or baseline characteristics between the \nravulizumab and eculizumab treatment groups in either of the Phase 3 studies. The 12-month \ntransfusion history was similar between ravulizumab and eculizumab treatment groups within each of \nthe Phase 3 studies.  \n \nStudy in complement-inhibitor naïve patients with PNH \n \nThe complement-inhibitor naïve study was a 26-week, multicentre, open-label, randomised, \nactive-controlled, Phase 3 study conducted in 246 patients who were naïve to complement inhibitor \ntreatment prior to study entry. Eligible patients to enter this trial had to demonstrate high disease \nactivity, defined as LDH level ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening along with the \npresence of 1 or more of the following PNH-related signs or symptoms within 3 months of screening: \nfatigue, haemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), anaemia \n(haemoglobin < 10 g/dL), history of a major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, \nor erectile dysfunction; or history of packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion due to PNH. \n \nMore than 80 % of patients in both treatment groups had a history of transfusion within 12 months of \nstudy entry. The majority of the complement-inhibitor naïve study population was highly haemolytic \nat baseline; 86.2 % of enrolled patients presented with elevated LDH ≥ 3 × ULN, which is a direct \nmeasurement of intravascular haemolysis, in the setting of PNH.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nTable 5 presents the baseline characteristics of the PNH patients enrolled in the complement-inhibitor \nnaïve study, with no apparent clinically meaningful differences observed between the treatment arms. \n \nTable 5:  Baseline characteristics in the complement-inhibitor naïve study \n\nParameter Statistics Ravulizumab (N = 125) \nEculizumab \n\n(N = 121) \nAge (years) at PNH diagnosis Mean (SD) \n\nMedian \nMin, max \n\n37.9 (14.90) \n34.0 \n\n15, 81 \n\n39.6 (16.65) \n36.5 \n\n13, 82 \nAge (years) at first infusion in study Mean (SD) \n\nMedian \nMin, max \n\n44.8 (15.16) \n43.0 \n\n18, 83 \n\n46.2 (16.24) \n45.0 \n\n18, 86 \nSex (n, %) Male \n\nFemale \n65 (52.0) \n60 (48.0) \n\n69 (57.0) \n52 (43.0) \n\nPre-treatment LDH levels Mean (SD) 1633.5 (778.75) 1578.3 (727.06) \nMedian 1513.5 1445.0 \n\nNumber of patients with packed red \nblood cell (pRBC) transfusions within \n12 months prior to first dose \n\nn (%) 103 (82.4) 100 (82.6) \n\nUnits of pRBC transfused within \n12 months prior to first dose \n\nTotal 925 861 \nMean (SD) 9.0 (7.74) 8.6 (7.90) \nMedian 6.0 6.0 \n\nTotal PNH RBC clone size Median 33.6 34.2 \nTotal PNH granulocyte clone size Median 93.8 92.4 \nPatients with any PNH conditionsa \nprior to informed consent \n\nn (%) 121 (96.8) 120 (99.2) \n\n   Anaemia  103 (82.4) 105 (86.8) \n   Haematuria or haemoglobinuria  81 (64.8) 75 (62.0) \n   Aplastic anaemia  41 (32.8) 38 (31.4) \n   Renal failure  19 (15.2) 11 (9.1) \n   Myelodysplastic syndrome  7 (5.6) 6 (5.0) \n   Pregnancy complication  3 (2.4) 4 (3.3) \n   Otherb  27 (21.6) 13 (10.7) \n\na Based on medical history.  \nb “Other” as specified on case report form included thrombocytopenia, chronic kidney disease, and pancytopenia, \nas well as a number of other conditions. \n \nThe coprimary endpoints were transfusion avoidance, and haemolysis as directly measured by \nnormalisation of LDH levels (LDH levels ≤ 1 × ULN; the ULN for LDH is 246 U/L).

The overall mean weight at baseline was 22.2 kg;majority of the patients were \nin the baseline weight category ≥ 10 to < 20 kg. The majority of patients (72.2%) had pretreatment extra \nrenal signs (cardiovascular, pulmonary, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, skin, skeletal muscle) \nor symptoms of aHUS at baseline. At baseline, 33.3% (n = 6) of patients had CKD Stage 5.  \n \nA total of 10 patients, who switched from eculizumab to ravulizumab, had documented diagnosis of \naHUS and evidence of TMA were enrolled. Patients had to have clinical response to eculizumab prior \nto enrolment (i.e LDH <1.5 X ULN and platelet count ≥ 150,000/μL, and eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73m2). \nConsequently, there is no information on the use of ravulizumab in patient refractory to eculizumab.  \n \nTable 10 presents the baseline characteristics of the paediatric patients enrolled in Study ALXN1210-\naHUS-312.  \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTable 10:  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 \n\nParameter Statistics \nRavulizumab \n\n(Naïve, N = 18) \nRavulizumab \n\n(Switch, N = 10) \nAge at time of first infusion (years) category \n\nBirth to < 2 years \n2 to < 6 years \n6 to < 12 years \n12 to < 18 years \n\nn (%)  \n2 (11.1) \n9 (50.0) \n5 (27.8) \n2 (11.1) \n\n \n1 (10.0) \n1 (10.0) \n1 (10.0) \n7 (70.0) \n\n \nSex  \n\nMale \nn (%)  \n\n8 (44.4) \n \n\n9 (90.0) \nRacea \n\nAmerican Indian or Alaskan Native \nAsian \nBlack or African American \nWhite \nUnknown \n\nn (%)  \n1 (5.6) \n\n5 (27.8) \n3 (16.7) \n9 (50.0) \n1 (5.6) \n\n \n0 (0.0) \n\n4 (40.0) \n1 (10.0) \n5 (50.0) \n0 (0.0) \n\nHistory of transplant n (%) 1 (5.6) 1 (10.0) \nPlatelets (109/L) blood Median (min, \n\nmax) \n51.25 (14, 125) 281.75 (207, \n\n415.5) \nHaemoglobin (g/L)  Median (min, \n\nmax) \n74.25 (32, 106) 132.0 (114.5, 148) \n\nLDH (U/L)  Median (min, \nmax) \n\n1963.0 (772, 4985) 206.5 (138.5, 356) \n\neGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)  Median (min, \nmax) \n\n22.0 (10, 84) 99.75 (54, 136.5) \n\nRequired dialysis at baseline  n (%) 6 (33.3) 0 (0.0) \nNote: Percentages are based on the total number of patients. \na Patients can have multiple races selected. \nAbbreviations: aHUS = atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; \nLDH = lactate dehydrogenase; max = maximum; min = minimum. \n \nThe primary endpoint was Complete TMA Response during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, as \nevidenced by normalisation of haematological parameters (platelet ≥ 150 x 109/L and LDH ≤246 U/L) \nand ≥ 25% improvement in serum creatinine from baseline.

All patients with Complete TMA Response maintained it through the Initial \nEvaluation Period with continuous improvements seen in renal function. An increase in mean platelet \ncount was observed rapidly after commencement of ravulizumab, increasing from 60.50 × 109/L at \n\n\n\n17 \n\nbaseline to 296.67 × 109/L at Day 8 and remained above 296 × 109/L at all subsequent visits in the \nInitial Evaluation Period (26 weeks). \n \nThree additional patients had a Complete TMA Response that was confirmed after the 26-week Initial \nEvaluation Period (with a Complete TMA Response occurring at Days 291, 297 and 353); thus, 17 of \n18 (94.4%) paediatric patients (95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) had a Complete TMA Response .  Individual \ncomponent response increased to 17 of 18 (94.4%; 95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) patients for platelet count \nnormalization, 17 of 18 (94.4%; 95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) patients for LDH normalization, and 17 of 18 \n(94.4%; 95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) patients for renal function improvement.  \n \nAll 6 of the patients who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis; 5 of which \nhad already done so by Day 43. No patient started dialysis during the study. The majority of the \npatient population (15/17), improved by 1 or more CKD stages by Day 183; 14 patients improved by 2 \nor more stages.

The time to maximum observed \nconcentration (tmax) is expected at the end of infusion (EOI) or soon after EOI. Therapeutic \nsteady-state drug concentrations are reached after the first dose.  \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean (standard deviation [SD]) volume of distribution at steady state for patients with PNH and \naHUS on the studied weight-based dose regimen was 5.35 (0.92) L and 5.22 (1.85) L respectively.  \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nAs an immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) monoclonal antibody, ravulizumab is expected to be metabolized \nin the same manner as any endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via \ncatabolic pathways), and is subject to similar elimination. Ravulizumab contains only natural \noccurring amino acids and has no known active metabolites. The mean (SD) values for terminal \nelimination half-life and clearance of ravulizumab in patients with PNH and aHUS are 49.7 (8.9) days \nand 0.08 (0.022) L/day and 51.8 (16.2) days and 0.08 (0.04) L/day, respectively.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nOver the studied dose and regimen range, ravulizumab exhibited dose proportional and time linear \npharmacokinetics (PK).  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nWeight \nBody weight is a significant covariate in patients with PNH and aHUS, resulting in lower exposures in \nheavier patients. Weight-based dosing is proposed in section 4.2, Table 1.  \n \nNo formal trial of the effect of sex, race, age (geriatric), hepatic or renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of ravulizumab was conducted. However, based on population-PK assessment no \nimpact of sex, age, race and hepatic or renal function on ravulizumab PK was identified in the studied \nhealthy volunteers, subjects and patients with PNH or aHUS, and as a result, no dosing adjustment is \nconsidered necessary. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ravulizumab have been studied in aHUS patients with a range of renal \nimpairment including patients receiving dialysis. There have been no observed differences in \npharmacokinetic parameters noted in these subpopulations of patients including patients with \nproteinuria.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAnimal reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with ravulizumab, but were \nconducted in mice with a murine surrogate complement inhibitory antibody, BB5.1. No clear \ntreatment-related effects or adverse effects were observed in the murine surrogate reproductive \ntoxicology studies in mice. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, \ntwo cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring \nborn to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose (approximately 4 times the maximum \nrecommended human ravulizumab dose, based on a body weight comparison); however, the exposure \ndid not increase foetal loss or neonatal death. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nNo animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of \nravulizumab. \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on nonclinical studies using a murine \nsurrogate molecule, BB5.1, in mice. \n \n \n6.

What Ultomiris is and what it is used for \n \nWhat is Ultomiris \nUltomiris is a medicine that contains the active substance ravulizumab and it belongs to a class of \nmedicines called monoclonal antibodies, that attach to a specific target in the body. Ravulizumab has \nbeen designed to attach to the C5 complement protein, which is a part of the body’s defence system \ncalled the ‘complement system’. \n \nWhat is Ultomiris used for \nUltomiris is used to treat adult patients with a disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria \n(PNH). In patients with PNH, the complement system is overactive and attacks their red blood cells, \nwhich can lead to low blood counts (anaemia), tiredness, difficulty in functioning, pain, abdominal \npain, dark urine, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, erectile dysfunction and blood clots. By \nattaching to and blocking the C5 protein, this medicine can stop complement proteins from attacking \nred blood cells and so control symptoms of the disease.  \n \nUltomiris is also used to treat both adult and children patients with a disease affecting the blood \nsystem and kidney called atypical Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome  (aHUS). In patients with aHUS, \ntheir kidneys and blood vessels, including platelets, can be inflamed which can lead to low blood \ncounts (thrombocytopenia and anaemia), reduced or lost kidney function, blood clots, tiredness and \ndifficulty in functioning. Ultomiris can block the body’s inflammatory response, and its ability to \nattack and destroy its own vulnerable blood vessels and so control symptoms of the disease including \ninjury to the kidneys. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Ultomiris \n \nDo not use Ultomiris: \n- If you are allergic to ravulizumab, proteins derived from mouse products, other monoclonal \n\nantibodies, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- If you have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n- If you have meningococcal infection. \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before using Ultomiris. \n \nMeningococcal and other Neisseria infections symptoms \nBecause the medicine blocks the complement system, which is part of the body’s defences against \ninfection, the use of Ultomiris increases your risk of meningococcal infection caused by Neisseria \nmeningitidis. These are severe infections affecting the linings of the brain and can spread throughout \nthe blood and body (sepsis).  \n \nConsult your doctor before you start Ultomiris to be sure that you receive vaccination against \nNeisseria meningitidis at least 2 weeks before beginning therapy. If you cannot be vaccinated 2 weeks \nbeforehand, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you \nhave been vaccinated. Ensure that your current meningococcal vaccination is up to date. You should \nalso be aware that vaccination may not always prevent this type of infection. In accordance with \nnational recommendations, your doctor might consider that you need supplementary measures to \nprevent infection.  \n \nMeningococcal infection symptoms \nBecause of the importance of rapidly identifying and treating meningococcal infection in patients who \nreceive Ultomiris, you will be provided a ‘patient safety card’ to carry with you at all times, listing \nrelevant signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection/sepsis.  \nIf you experience any of the following symptoms, you should immediately inform your doctor:    \n- headache with nausea or vomiting \n- headache and fever \n- headache with a stiff neck or stiff back \n- fever \n- fever and rash  \n- confusion  \n- muscle aches with flu-like symptoms \n- eyes sensitive to light \n \nTreatment for meningococcal infection while travelling \nIf you are travelling in a region where you are unable to contact your doctor or will be temporarily \nunable to receive medical treatment, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic against Neisseria \nmeningitidis to bring with you. If you experience any of the symptoms described above, you should \ntake the course of antibiotics as prescribed. You should bear in mind that you should still see a doctor \nas soon as possible, even if you feel better after having taken the antibiotics. \n \nInfections \nBefore starting Ultomiris, inform your doctor if you have any infections.  \n \nInfusion reactions \nWhen Ultomiris is given, you may experience reactions to the infusion (drip) such as headache, lower \nback pain, and infusion-related pain.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nPatients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae and \npneumococcal infections. \n \nOther medicines and Ultomiris \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines.  \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n\n\n35 \n\nThe effects of the medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, effective contraception \nduring treatment and up to 8 months after treatment should be used in women who are able to get \npregnant.  \n \nPregnancy/ Breast-feeding \nUltomiris is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to \nhave a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nUltomiris contains sodium \nThis medicine when diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection for IV \nadministration contains 2.65 g sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 720 mL at the \nmaximal dose. This is equivalent to 133 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of \nsodium for an adult.  \nYou should take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to use Ultomiris \n \nAt least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will give you a vaccine against \nmeningococcal infections if you have not previously had one or if your vaccination is outdated. If you \ncannot be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before you start treatment with Ultomiris, your doctor will \nprescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection until 2 weeks after you have been vaccinated. \nIf your child is less than 18 years, your doctor will administer a vaccine (if not yet done) against \nHaemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal infections according to the national vaccination \nrecommendations for each age group. \n \nInstructions for proper use \nUltomiris is given by infusion (drip) into a vein. The infusion will take approximately 2 hours. \n \nYour dose will be worked out by your doctor, based on your body weight, as shown in Table 1. Your \nfirst dose is called the loading dose. Two weeks after receiving your loading dose, you will be given a \nmaintenance dose of Ultomiris, and this will then be repeated once every 8 weeks for patient above 20 \nkg and every 4 weeks for patient less than 20 kg.  \n \nIf you were previously receiving another medicine for PNH and aHUS called Soliris, the loading dose \nshould be given 2 weeks after the last Soliris infusion.  \n \nTable 1:  Ultomiris weight-based dosing regimen \n\nBody weight range (kg) Loading dose (mg) Maintenance dose (mg) \n10 to less than 20 600 600 \n20 to less than 30 900 2,100 \n30 to less than 40 1,200 2,700 \n40 to less than 60 2,400 3,000 \n60 to less than 100 2,700 3,300 \n\nabove 100 3,000 3,600 \n \nIf you receive more Ultomiris than you should  \nIf you suspect that you have been accidentally given a higher dose of Ultomiris than prescribed, please \ncontact your doctor for advice.  \n \nIf you forget an appointment to receive Ultomiris \nIf you forget an appointment, please contact your doctor immediately for advice and see section below \n“If you stop using Ultomiris”.  \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nIf you stop using Ultomiris for PNH \nInterrupting or ending treatment with Ultomiris may cause your PNH symptoms to return with greater \nseverity. Your doctor will discuss the possible side effects with you and explain the risks. Your doctor \nwill want to monitor you closely for at least 16 weeks. \n \nThe risks of stopping Ultomiris include an increase in the destruction of your red blood cells, which \nmay cause: \n- A significant fall in your red blood cell counts (anaemia),  \n- Confusion or change in how alert you are, \n- Chest pain, or angina, \n- An increase in your serum creatinine level (problems with your kidneys), or \n- Thrombosis (blood clotting).    \nIf you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor.    \n \nIf you stop using Ultomiris for aHUS  \nInterrupting or ending treatment with Ultomiris may cause your aHUS symptoms to come back. Your \ndoctor will discuss the possible side effects with you and explain the risks. Your doctor will want to \nmonitor you closely. \n \nThe risks of stopping Ultomiris include an increase in small blood vessel damage, which may cause: \n- A significant fall in your platelets (thrombocytopenia), \n- A significant rise in destruction of your red blood cells, \n- Decreased urination (problems with your kidneys), \n- An increase in your serum creatinine level (problems with your kidneys),  \n- Confusion or change in how alert you are, \n- Change in your vision \n- Chest pain, or angina, \n- Shortness of breath, or \n- Thrombosis (blood clotting).    \n \nIf you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n4.
