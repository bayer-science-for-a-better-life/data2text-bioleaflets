Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for \nHarvoni 33.75 mg/150 mg or 45 mg/200 mg granules. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 3: Guidance for ribavirin dosing when administered with Harvoni to adult patients with \ndecompensated cirrhosis \n\nPatient Ribavirin dose* \nChild-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) Class B \ncirrhosis pre-transplant \n\n1,000 mg per day for patients < 75 kg and 1,200 mg for those \nweighing \u2265 75 kg \n\nCPT Class C cirrhosis pre-transplant \n \nCPT Class B or C cirrhosis post-\ntransplant \n\nStarting dose of 600 mg, which can be titrated up to a maximum \nof 1,000/1,200 mg (1,000 mg for patients weighing < 75 kg and \n1,200 mg for patients weighing \u2265 75 kg) if well tolerated. If the \nstarting dose is not well tolerated, the dose should be reduced as \nclinically indicated based on haemoglobin levels \n\n* If a more normalized dose of ribavirin (by weight and renal function) cannot be reached for reasons of tolerability, \n24 weeks of Harvoni + ribavirin should be considered in order to minimize the risk for relapse. \n \nFor adults when ribavirin is added to Harvoni, refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \nribavirin. \n \nIn paediatric patients aged 3 years and above the following ribavirin dosing is recommended where \nribavirin is divided into two daily doses and given with food: \n \nTable 4: Guidance for ribavirin dosing when administered with Harvoni to paediatric patients aged \n3 years and above. \n\nBody weight kg Ribavirin Dose* \n< 47 15 mg/kg/day \n47-49 600 mg/day \n50-65 800 mg/day \n66-74 1000 mg/day \n> or = 75 1200 mg/day \n\n* The daily dosage of ribavirin is weight-based and administered orally in two divided doses with food. \n \nDose modification of ribavirin in adults taking 1,000-1,200 mg daily \nIf Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin and a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially \nrelated to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be modified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the \nadverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. Table 5 provides guidelines for dose modifications \nand discontinuation based on the patient\u2019s haemoglobin concentration and cardiac status. \n \nTable 5: Ribavirin dose modification guideline for co-administration with Harvoni in adults \n\nLaboratory values Reduce ribavirin dose to \n600 mg/day if: \n\nDiscontinue ribavirin if: \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with no \ncardiac disease \n\n< 10 g/dL < 8.5 g/dL \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with \nhistory of stable cardiac disease \n\n\u2265 2 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin \nduring any 4-week treatment \nperiod \n\n< 12 g/dL despite 4 weeks at \nreduced dose \n\n \nOnce ribavirin has been withheld due to either a laboratory abnormality or clinical manifestation, an \nattempt may be made to restart ribavirin at 600 mg daily and further increase the dose to 800 mg daily. \nHowever, it is not recommended that ribavirin be increased to the originally assigned dose (1,000 mg \nto 1,200 mg daily). \n \nPaediatric population aged < 3 years \nThe safety and efficacy of Harvoni in paediatric patients aged < 3 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMissed dose \nPatients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 5 hours of dosing an additional tablet \nshould be taken. If vomiting occurs more than 5 hours after dosing, no further dose is needed (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIf a dose is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be instructed to take \nthe tablet as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at the usual time. If it is after \n18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Patients \nshould be instructed not to take a double dose. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Harvoni is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate \n[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. Harvoni can be \nused in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available \n(see section 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Harvoni is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte [CPT] class A, B or C) (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir have been established in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \nPatients should be instructed to swallow the tablet(s) whole with or without food. Due to the bitter \ntaste, it is recommended that film-coated tablets are not chewed or crushed (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration with rosuvastatin (see section 4.5). \n \nUse with strong P-gp inducers \n \nMedicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducers in the intestine (carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John\u2019s wort). Co-administration will \nsignificantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and could result in loss of \nefficacy of Harvoni (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHarvoni should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \nsofosbuvir. \n \nGenotype-specific activity \n \nConcerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning \ngenotype-specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1. \n \nThe clinical data to support the use of Harvoni in adults infected with HCV genotype 3 are limited (see \nsection 5.1). The relative efficacy of a 12-week regimen consisting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir \n+ ribavirin, compared to a 24-week regimen of sofosbuvir + ribavirin has not been investigated. A \nconservative 24 weeks of therapy is advised in all treatment-experienced genotype 3 patients and those \ntreatment-na\u00efve genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis (see section 4.2). In genotype 3-infection, the use of \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHarvoni (always in combination with ribavirin) should only be considered for patients who are \ndeemed at high risk for clinical disease progression and who do not have alternative treatment options. \n \nThe clinical data to support the use of Harvoni in adults infected with HCV genotype 2 and 6 are \nlimited (see section 5.1). \n \nSevere bradycardia and heart block \n \nLife-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-\ncontaining regimens are used in combination with amiodarone. Bradycardia has generally occurred \nwithin hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks \nafter initiating HCV treatment. \n \nAmiodarone should only be used in patients on Harvoni when other alternative anti-arrhythmic \ntreatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. \n \nShould concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary it is recommended that patients \nundergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after \nwhich outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the \nfirst 2 weeks of treatment. \n \nDue to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried \nout for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated \non Harvoni. \n \nAll patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of \nbradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they \nexperience them. \n \nUse in diabetic patients \n \nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic \npatients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the \nfirst 3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the \ndiabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct-acting antiviral therapy is initiated. \n \nHCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection \n \nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before \ninitiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should \ntherefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. \n \nTreatment of patients with prior exposure to HCV direct-acting antivirals \n \nIn patients who fail treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, selection of NS5A resistance mutations that \nsubstantially reduce the susceptibility to ledipasvir is seen in the majority of cases (see section 5.1). \nLimited data indicate that such NS5A mutations do not revert on long-term follow-up. There are \npresently no data to support the effectiveness of retreatment of patients who have failed \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir with a subsequent regimen that contains an NS5A inhibitor. Similarly, there are \npresently no data to support the effectiveness of NS3/4A protease inhibitors in patients who previously \nfailed prior therapy that included an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Such patients may therefore be \ndependent on other classes of medicinal products for clearance of HCV infection. Consequently, \nconsideration should be given to longer treatment for patients with uncertain subsequent retreatment \noptions. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate \n[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and ESRD requiring haemodialysis. Harvoni can be used in these \npatients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available (see \nsections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). When Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin refer also to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) \n< 50 mL/min (see section 5.2). \n \nAdults with decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant \n \nThe efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in genotype 5 and genotype 6 HCV-infected patients with \ndecompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant has not been \ninvestigated. Treatment with Harvoni should be guided by an assessment of the potential benefits and \nrisks for the individual patient. \n \nUse with moderate P-gp inducers \n \nMedicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. oxcarbazepine) may decrease \nledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Harvoni. \nCo-administration of such medicinal products is not recommended with Harvoni (see section 4.5). \n \nUse with certain HIV antiretroviral regimens \n \nHarvoni has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure, especially when used together with an HIV \nregimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or \ncobicistat). The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Harvoni and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with \nco-administration of Harvoni with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing \nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \ngiven in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be \nconsidered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving Harvoni \nconcomitantly with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or with \ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for tenofovir-\nassociated adverse reactions. Refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate, or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring. \n \nUse with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors \n \nCo-administration of Harvoni and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can significantly increase \nthe concentration of the statin, which increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nHarvoni is not recommended for use in paediatric patients aged < 3 years because the safety and \nefficacy have not been established in this population. \n \nExcipients \n \nHarvoni contains the azo colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic \nreactions. It also contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs Harvoni contains ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, any interactions that have been identified with these \nactive substances individually may occur with Harvoni. \n \nPotential for Harvoni to affect other medicinal products \n \nLedipasvir is an in vitro inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) \nand may increase intestinal absorption of co-administered substrates for these transporters.  \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect Harvoni \n \nLedipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporter P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. \n \nMedicinal products that are strong P-gp inducers (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, \nrifampicin, rifabutin and St. John\u2019s wort) may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma \nconcentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and thus are \ncontraindicated with Harvoni (see section 4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in \nthe intestine (e.g. oxcarbazepine) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations \nleading to reduced therapeutic effect of Harvoni. Co-administration with such medicinal products is \nnot recommended with Harvoni (see section 4.4). Co-administration with medicinal products that \ninhibit P-gp and/or BCRP may increase ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations without \nincreasing GS-331007 plasma concentration; Harvoni may be co-administered with P-gp and/or \nBCRP inhibitors. Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir \nmediated by CYP450s or UGT1A1 enzymes are not expected. \n \nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \n \nAs liver function may change during treatment with Harvoni, a close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. \n \nImpact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such \nas calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to \nclearance of HCV virus. \n \nInteractions between Harvoni and other medicinal products \n \nTable 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product \ninteractions (where 90% confidence interval [CI] of the geometric least-squares mean [GLSM] ratio \nwere within \u201c\u2194\u201d, extended above \u201c\u2191\u201d, or extended below \u201c\u2193\u201d the predetermined equivalence \nboundaries). The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with either \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir or ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal \nproduct interactions that may occur with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.

Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal \neffects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. Women of childbearing \npotential or their male partners must use an effective form of contraception during treatment and for a \nperiod of time after the treatment has concluded as recommended in the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for ribavirin. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for \nadditional information. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ledipasvir, \nsofosbuvir or Harvoni in pregnant women. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. No \nsignificant effects on foetal development have been observed with ledipasvir or sofosbuvir in rats and \nrabbits. However, it has not been possible to fully estimate exposure margins achieved for sofosbuvir \nin the rat relative to the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Harvoni during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ledipasvir or sofosbuvir and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n \nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals has shown excretion of ledipasvir and metabolites of \nsofosbuvir in milk (see section 5.3). \n \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, Harvoni should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Harvoni on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of ledipasvir or sofosbuvir on fertility. \n \nIf ribavirin is co-administered with Harvoni, the contraindications regarding use of ribavirin during \npregnancy and breast-feeding apply (see also the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHarvoni (administered alone or in combination with ribavirin) has no or negligible influence on the \nability to drive and use machines. However, patients should be advised that fatigue was more common \nin patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir compared to placebo. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile in adults \n \nThe safety assessment of Harvoni was mainly based on pooled Phase 3 clinical studies, without a \ncontrol, in 1952 patients who received Harvoni for 8, 12 or 24 weeks, including 872 patients who \nreceived Harvoni in combination with ribavirin. \n \nThe proportion of patients who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0%, \n< 1% and 1% for patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively; and \n< 1%, 0%, and 2% for patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin combination therapy for 8, \n12 and 24 weeks, respectively. \n \nIn clinical studies, fatigue and headache were more common in patients treated with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir compared to placebo. When ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was studied with ribavirin, the \nmost frequent adverse drug reactions to ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin combination therapy were \nconsistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin, without increasing the frequency or severity of \nthe expected adverse drug reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse events \n \nThe following adverse drug reactions have been identified with Harvoni (Table 7). The adverse \nreactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as \nfollows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 7: Adverse drug reactions identified with Harvoni \nFrequency Adverse drug reaction \n\nNervous system disorders: \nVery common headache \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nCommon rash \nNot known angioedema \nGeneral disorders: \nVery common fatigue \n \nAdults with decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant \n \nThe safety profile of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks in adults with \ndecompensated liver disease and/or those post-liver transplant was assessed in two open-label studies \n(SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2). No new adverse drug reactions were detected among patients with \ndecompensated cirrhosis and/or who were post-liver transplant and who received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir \nwith ribavirin. Although adverse events, including serious adverse events, occurred more frequently in \nthis study compared to studies that excluded decompensated patients and/or patients who were post-\nliver transplantation, the adverse events observed were those expected as clinical sequelae of advanced \nliver disease and/or transplantation or were consistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin (see \nsection 5.1 for details of this study). \n \nDecreases in haemoglobin to < 10 g/dL and < 8.5 g/dL during treatment were experienced by 39% and \n13% of patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin, respectively. Ribavirin was \ndiscontinued in 15% of the patients. \n \n7% of liver transplant recipients had a modification of their immunosuppressive agents. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir was administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients with genotype 1 CHC and severe \nrenal impairment in an open-label study (Study 0154). In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate \nof adverse events was not clearly elevated from what is expected in patients with severe renal \nimpairment. \n \nThe safety of Harvoni has been evaluated in a 12-week non-controlled study including 95 patients \nwith ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4063). In this setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-\n331007 is 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have been observed in \npreclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and deaths was not \nclearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Harvoni in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above are based on data \nfrom a Phase 2, open-label clinical study (Study 1116) that enrolled 226 patients who were treated \nwith ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 or 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks. The \nadverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir in adults (see Table 7). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac arrhythmias \nCases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when Harvoni is used with \namiodarone and/or other drugs that lower heart rate (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nSkin disorders \nFrequency not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest documented doses of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir were 120 mg twice daily for 10 days and a \nsingle dose of 1,200 mg, respectively. In these healthy volunteer studies, there were no untoward \neffects observed at these dose levels, and adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity to \nthose reported in the placebo groups. The effects of higher doses are not known. \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with Harvoni. If overdose occurs the patient must be \nmonitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with Harvoni consists of general supportive \nmeasures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \nHaemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of ledipasvir as ledipasvir is highly bound to \nplasma protein. Haemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of \nsofosbuvir, GS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Direct-acting antiviral, ATC code: J05AP51 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLedipasvir is a HCV inhibitor targeting the HCV NS5A protein, which is essential for both RNA \nreplication and the assembly of HCV virions. Biochemical confirmation of NS5A inhibition by \nledipasvir is not currently possible as NS5A has no enzymatic function. In vitro resistance selection \nand cross-resistance studies indicate ledipasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action. \n \nSofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is \nessential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular \nmetabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analogue triphosphate (GS-461203), which \ncan be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. \nGS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and \nRNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. \n \nAntiviral activity \n \nThe EC50 values of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding NS5A \nand NS5B sequences from clinical isolates are detailed in Table 8. The presence of 40% human serum \nhad no effect on the anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir but reduced the anti-HCV activity of ledipasvir \nby 12-fold against genotype 1a HCV replicons. \n \nTable 8: Activity of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir against chimeric replicons \n\nGenotype \nreplicons \n\nLedipasvir activity (EC50, nM) Sofosbuvir activity (EC50, nM) \nStable replicons NS5A transient \n\nreplicons \nMedian (range)a \n\nStable replicons NS5B transient \nreplicons \n\nMedian (range)a \nGenotype 1a 0.031 0.018 (0.009-0.085) 40 62 (29-128) \nGenotype 1b 0.004 0.006 (0.004-0.007) 110 102 (45-170) \nGenotype 2a 21-249 - 50 29 (14-81) \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23 \n\nGenotype \nreplicons \n\nLedipasvir activity (EC50, nM) Sofosbuvir activity (EC50, nM) \nStable replicons NS5A transient \n\nreplicons \nMedian (range)a \n\nStable replicons NS5B transient \nreplicons \n\nMedian (range)a \nGenotype 2b 16-530b - 15b - \nGenotype 3a 168 - 50 81 (24-181) \nGenotype 4a 0.39 - 40 - \nGenotype 4d 0.60 - - - \nGenotype 5a 0.15b - 15b - \nGenotype 6a 1.1b - 14b - \nGenotype 6e 264b - - - \na Transient replicons carrying NS5A or NS5B from patient isolates. \nb The chimeric replicons carrying NS5A genes from genotype 2b, 5a, 6a and 6e were used for testing ledipasvir while the \n\nchimeric replicons carrying NS5B genes from genotype 2b, 5a or 6a were used for testing sofosbuvir. \n \nResistance \n \nIn cell culture \nHCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir have been selected in cell culture for \ngenotype 1a and 1b. Reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir was associated with the primary NS5A \nsubstitution Y93H in both genotype 1a and 1b. Additionally a Q30E substitution developed in \ngenotype 1a replicons. Site-directed mutagenesis of NS5A RAVs showed that substitutions conferring \na fold-change > 100 and \u2264 1,000 in ledipasvir susceptibility are Q30H/R, L31I/M/V, P32L and Y93T \nin genotype 1a and P58D and Y93S in genotype 1b; and substitutions conferring a fold-change \n> 1,000 are M28A/G, Q30E/G/K, H58D, Y93C/H/N/S in genotype 1a and A92K and Y93H in \ngenotype 1b. \n \nHCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple \ngenotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a. Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated \nwith the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined. Site-directed \nmutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of 8 genotypes conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced \nsusceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the viral replication capacity by 89% to 99% compared to the \ncorresponding wild-type. \n \nIn clinical studies \u2013 Adults-Genotype 1 \nIn a pooled analysis of patients who received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in Phase 3 studies (ION-3, ION-1 \nand ION-2), 37 patients (29 with genotype 1a and 8 with genotype 1b) qualified for resistance analysis \ndue to virologic failure or early study drug discontinuation and having HCV RNA > 1,000 IU/mL. \nPost-baseline NS5A and NS5B deep sequencing data (assay cut off of 1%) were available for 37/37 \nand 36/37 patients, respectively. \n \nNS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were observed in post-baseline isolates from \n29/37 patients (22/29 genotype 1a and 7/8 genotype 1b) not achieving sustained virologic response \n(SVR). Of the 29 genotype 1a patients who qualified for resistance testing, 22/29 (76%) patients \nharboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions K24, M28, Q30, L31, S38 and Y93 at failure, while \nthe remaining 7/29 patients had no NS5A RAVs detected at failure. The most common variants were \nQ30R, Y93H and L31M. Of the 8 genotype 1b patients who qualified for resistance testing, 7/8 (88%) \nharboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions L31 and Y93 at failure, while 1/8 patients had no \nNS5A RAVs at failure. The most common variant was Y93H. Among the 8 patients who had no \nNS5A RAVs at failure, 7 patients received 8 weeks of treatment (n = 3 with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir; \nn = 4 with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin) and 1 patient received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. \nIn phenotypic analyses, post-baseline isolates from patients who harboured NS5A RAVs at failure \nshowed 20- to at least a 243-fold (the highest dose tested) reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir. \nSite-directed mutagenesis of the Y93H substitution in both genotype 1a and 1b as well as the Q30R \nand L31M substitution in genotype 1a conferred high levels of reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir \n(fold-change in EC50 ranging from 544-fold to 1,677-fold). \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nAmong post-transplant patients with compensated liver disease or patients with decompensated liver \ndisease either pre- or post-transplant (SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies), relapse was associated with \nthe detection of one or more of the following NS5A RAVs: K24R, M28T, Q30R/H/K, L31V, H58D \nand Y93H/C in 12/14 genotype 1a patients, and L31M, Y93H/N in 6/6 genotype 1b patients. \n \nA NS5B substitution E237G was detected in 3 patients (1 genotype 1b and 2 genotype 1a) in the \nPhase 3 studies (ION-3, ION-1 and ION-2) and 3 patients with genotype 1a infection in the SOLAR-1 \nand SOLAR-2 studies at the time of relapse. The E237G substitution showed a 1.3-fold reduction in \nsusceptibility to sofosbuvir in the genotype 1a replicon assay. The clinical significance of this \nsubstitution is currently unknown. \n \nThe sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B was not detected in any virologic \nfailure isolate from the Phase 3 studies. However, the NS5B S282T substitution in combination with \nNS5A substitutions L31M, Y93H and Q30L were detected in one patient at failure following 8 weeks \nof treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir from a Phase 2 study (LONESTAR). This patient was \nsubsequently retreated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks and achieved SVR \nfollowing retreatment. \n \nIn the SIRIUS study (see \u201cClinical efficacy and safety\u201d, below) 5 patients with genotype 1 infection \nrelapsed after treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin. NS5A RAVs were seen at \nrelapse in 5/5 patients (for genotype 1a: Q30R/H + L31M/V [n = 1] and Q30R [n = 1]; for \ngenotype 1b: Y93H [n = 3]). \n \nIn clinical studies \u2013 Adults-Genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 \nNS5A RAVs: No genotype 2 infected patients experienced relapse in the clinical study and therefore \nthere are no data regarding NS5A RAVs at the time of failure. \n \nIn genotype 3 infected patients experiencing virologic failure, development of NS5A RAVs (including \nenrichment of RAVs present at baseline) was typically not detected at the time of failure (n = 17). \n \nIn genotype 4, 5 and 6 infection, only small numbers of patients have been evaluated (total of \n5 patients with failure). The NS5A substitution Y93C emerged in the HCV of 1 patient (genotype 4), \nwhile NS5A RAVs present at baseline were observed at the time of failure in all patients. In the \nSOLAR-2 study, one patient with genotype 4d developed NS5B substitution E237G at the time of \nrelapse. The clinical significance of this substitution is currently unknown. \n \nNS5B RAVs: The NS5B substitution S282T emerged in the HCV of 1/17 genotype 3-failures, and in \nthe HCV of 1/3, 1/1 and 1/1 of genotype 4-, 5- and 6-failures, respectively. \n \nEffect of baseline HCV resistance-associated variants on treatment outcome \n \nAdults-Genotype 1 \nAnalyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and \ntreatment outcome. In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 studies, 16% of patients had baseline \nNS5A RAVs identified by population or deep sequencing irrespective of subtype. Baseline \nNS5A RAVs were overrepresented in patients who experienced relapse in the Phase 3 studies (see \n\u201cClinical efficacy and safety\u201d). \n \nFollowing 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (without ribavirin) in treatment-\nexperienced patients (arm 1 of ION-2 study) 4/4 patients with baseline NS5A RAVs conferring a \nledipasvir fold-change of \u2264 100 achieved SVR. For the same treatment arm, patients with baseline \nNS5A RAVs conferring a fold-change of > 100, relapse occurred in 4/13 (31%), as compared to 3/95 \n(3%) in those without any baseline RAVs or RAVs conferring a fold-change of \u2264 100. \n \nFollowing 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin in treatment-experienced \npatients with compensated cirrhosis (SIRIUS, n = 77), 8/8 patients with baseline NS5A RAVs \nconferring > 100-fold reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir achieved SVR12. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nAmong post-transplant patients with compensated liver disease (SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies), no \nrelapse occurred in patients with baseline NS5A RAVs (n = 23) following 12 weeks of treatment with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin. Among patients with decompensated liver disease (pre- and post-\ntransplant), 4/16 (25%) patients with NS5A RAVs conferring > 100-fold resistance relapsed after \n12 weeks treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin compared to 7/120 (6%) in those without \nany baseline NS5A RAVs or RAVs conferring a fold-change of \u2264 100. \n \nThe group of NS5A RAVs that conferred > 100-fold shift and was observed in patients were the \nfollowing substitutions in genotype 1a (M28A, Q30H/R/E, L31M/V/I, H58D, Y93H/N/C) or in \ngenotype 1b (Y93H). The proportion of such baseline NS5A RAVs seen with deep sequencing varied \nfrom very low (cut off for assay = 1%) to high (main part of the plasma population). \n \nThe sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B \nsequence of any patient in Phase 3 studies by population or deep sequencing. SVR was achieved in all \n24 patients (n = 20 with L159F+C316N; n = 1 with L159F; and n = 3 with N142T) who had baseline \nvariants associated with resistance to NS5B nucleoside inhibitors. \n \nAdults-Genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 \nDue to the limited size of studies, the impact of baseline NS5A RAVs on treatment outcome for \npatients with genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 CHC has not been fully evaluated. No major differences in \noutcomes were observed by the presence or absence of baseline NS5A RAVs. \n \nPaediatric Patients \n \nThe presence of pre-treatment NS5A and/or NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome as all \nsubjects with pre-treatment RAVs achieved SVR12 and SVR24. One 8-year-old subject infected with \ngenotype 1a HCV who failed to achieve SVR12 had no NS5A or NS5B nucleoside inhibitor RAVs at \nbaseline and had emergent NS5A RAV Y93H at relapse. \n \nCross-resistance \n \nLedipasvir was fully active against the sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B \nwhile all ledipasvir resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A were fully susceptible to sofosbuvir. \nBoth sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to \nother classes of direct-acting antivirals with different mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B \nnon-nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors. NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to \nledipasvir may reduce the antiviral activity of other NS5A inhibitors. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of ledipasvir [LDV]/sofosbuvir [SOF] was evaluated in three open-label Phase 3 studies \nwith data available for a total of 1,950 patients with genotype 1 CHC. The three Phase 3 studies \nincluded one study conducted in non-cirrhotic treatment-na\u00efve patients (ION-3); one study in cirrhotic \nand non-cirrhotic treatment-na\u00efve patients (ION-1); and one study in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic \npatients who failed prior therapy with an interferon-based regimen, including regimens containing an \nHCV protease inhibitor (ION-2). Patients in these studies had compensated liver disease. All three \nPhase 3 studies evaluated the efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin. \n \nTreatment duration was fixed in each study. Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the \nclinical studies using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System. \nThe assay had a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU/mL. SVR was the primary endpoint to \ndetermine the HCV cure rate which was defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the \ncessation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nTreatment-na\u00efve adults without cirrhosis \u2013 ION-3 (study 0108) \u2013 Genotype 1 \nION-3 evaluated 8 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin and \n12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in treatment-na\u00efve non-cirrhotic patients with \ngenotype 1 CHC. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups and \nstratified by HCV genotype (1a versus 1b). \n \nTable 9: Demographics and baseline characteristics in study ION-3 \n\nPatient disposition LDV/SOF \n8 weeks \n(n = 215) \n\nLDV/SOF+RBV \n8 weeks \n(n = 216) \n\nLDV/SOF \n12 weeks \n(n = 216) \n\nTOTAL \n \n\n(n = 647) \nAge (years): median (range) 53 (22-75) 51 (21-71) 53 (20-71) 52 (20-75) \nMale gender 60% (130)  54% (117) 59% (128) 58% (375) \nRace: Black/ African American 21% (45) 17% (36) 19% (42) 19% (123) \n White 76% (164) 81% (176) 77% (167) 78% (507) \nGenotype 1a 80% (171) 80% (172) 80% (172) 80% (515)a \nIL28CC genotype 26% (56) 28% (60) 26% (56) 27% (172) \nFibroTest-Determined Metavir scoreb \n F0-F1 33% (72) 38% (81) 33% (72) 35% (225) \n F2 30% (65) 28% (61) 30% (65) 30% (191) \n F3-F4 36% (77) 33% (71) 37% (79) 35% (227) \n Not interpretable < 1% (1) 1% (3) 0% (0) < 1% (4) \na One patient in the LDV/SOF 8-week treatment arm did not have a confirmed genotype 1 subtype. \nb Non-missing FibroTest results are mapped to Metavir scores according to: 0-0.31 = F0-F1; 0.32-0.58 = F2; \n\n0.59-1.00 = F3-F4. \n \nTable 10: Response rates in study ION-3 \n\n LDV/SOF \n8 weeks \n(n = 215) \n\nLDV/SOF+RBV \n8 weeks \n(n = 216) \n\nLDV/SOF \n12 weeks \n(n = 216) \n\nSVR 94% (202/215) 93% (201/216) 96% (208/216) \nOutcome for patients without SVR \n On-treatment virologic failure 0/215 0/216 0/216 \n Relapsea 5% (11/215) 4% (9/214) 1% (3/216) \n Otherb < 1% (2/215) 3% (6/216) 2% (5/216) \nGenotype \n Genotype 1a 93% (159/171) 92% (159/172) 96% (165/172) \n Genotype 1b 98% (42/43) 95% (42/44) 98% (43/44) \na The denominator for relapse is the number of patients with HCV RNA < LLOQ at their last on-treatment assessment. \nb Other includes patients who did not achieve SVR and did not meet virologic failure criteria (e.g. lost to follow-up). \n \nThe 8-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin was non-inferior to the 8-week \ntreatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin (treatment difference 0.9%; 95% confidence interval: \n-3.9% to 5.7%) and the 12-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (treatment difference -2.3%; 97.5% \nconfidence interval: -7.2% to 3.6%).

In study 1118, 44 patients with genotype 1 \ninfection, including 12 cirrhotic patients, who had previously failed treatment with sofosbuvir + \nribavirin + PEG-IFN or with sofosbuvir + ribavirin were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin \nfor 12 weeks; the SVR was 100% (44/44). In study ION-4, 13 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients with \ngenotype 1, including 1 cirrhotic patient, who had failed a sofosbuvir + ribavirin regimen were \nenrolled; the SVR was 100% (13/13) after 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. \n \nHCV/HIV co-infected adults \u2013 ION-4 \nION-4 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment \nwith ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin in HCV treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced \npatients with genotype 1 or 4 CHC who were co-infected with HIV-1. Treatment-experienced patients \nhad failed prior treatment with PEG-IFN + ribavirin \u00b1 an HCV protease inhibitor or sofosbuvir + \nribavirin \u00b1 PEG-IFN. Patients were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy that included \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, administered with efavirenz, rilpivirine or raltegravir. \n \nThe median age was 52 years (range: 26 to 72); 82% of the patients were male; 61% were white; 34% \nwere black; 75% had genotype 1a HCV infection; 2% had genotype 4 infection; 76% had non-CC \nIL28B alleles (CT or TT); and 20% had compensated cirrhosis.

For genotype 3 infection, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was given with or \nwithout ribavirin, also for 12 weeks (Table 20). \n \nTable 19: Response rates (SVR12) with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks in patients with genotype 2, 4, 5 \nand 6 HCV infection \n\nStudy GT n TEa SVR12 Relapseb \nOverall Cirrhosis  \n\nStudy 1468 (LEPTON) 2 26 19% (5/26) 96% (25/26) 100% (2/2) 0% (0/25) \nStudy 1119  4 44 50% (22/44) 93% (41/44) 100% (10/10) 7% (3/44) \nStudy 1119 5 41 49% (20/41) 93% (38/41) 89% (8/9) 5% (2/40) \nStudy 0122 (ELECTRON-2) 6 25 0% (0/25) 96% (24/25) 100% (2/2) 4% (1/25) \na TE: number of treatment-experienced patients. \nb The denominator for relapse is the number of patients with HCV RNA < LLOQ at their last on-treatment assessment. \n \nTable 20: Response rates (SVR12) in patients with genotype 3 infection (ELECTRON-2) \n\n LDV/SOF+RBV \n12 weeks \n\nLDV/SOF \n12 weeks \n\n SVR Relapsea SVR Relapsea \nTreatment-na\u00efve 100% (26/26) 0% (0/26) 64% (16/25) 33% (8/24) \n\nPatients without cirrhosis 100% (20/20) 0% (0/21) 71% (15/21) 25% (5/20) \nPatients with cirrhosis 100% (6/6) 0% (0/5) 25% (1/4) 75% (3/4) \n\nTreatment-experienced 82% (41/50) 16% (8/49) NS NS \nPatients without cirrhosis 89% (25/28) 7% (2/27) NS NS \nPatients with cirrhosis 73% (16/22) 27% (6/22) NS NS \n\nNS: not studied. \na The denominator for relapse is the number of patients with HCV RNA < LLOQ at their last on-treatment assessment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nStudy 0154 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of \ntreatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in 18 genotype 1 HCV-infected patients with severe renal \nimpairment not requiring dialysis. At baseline, two patients had cirrhosis and the mean eGFR was \n24.9 mL/min (range: 9.0-39.6). SVR12 was achieved in 18/18 patients. \n \nStudy 4063 was an open-label three-arm clinical study that evaluated 8, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment \nwith ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in a total of 95 patients with genotype 1 (72%), 2 (22%), 4 (2%), 5 (1%), or \n6 (2%) CHC and ESRD requiring dialysis: 45 treatment-na\u00efve genotype 1 HCV-infected patients \nwithout cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 8 weeks; 31 treatment-experienced genotype 1 \nHCV-infected patients and treatment-na\u00efve or treatment-experienced patients with genotype 2, 5, and \n6 infection without cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks; and 19 genotype 1, 2, and 4 \nHCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks. Of the \n95 total patients, at baseline, 20% of patients had cirrhosis, 22% were treatment experienced, 21% had \nreceived a kidney transplant, 92% were on hemodialysis, and 8% were on peritoneal dialysis; mean \n\n\n\n33 \n\nduration on dialysis was 11.5 years (range: 0.2 to 43.0 years). The SVR rates for the 8, 12, and 24 \nweek ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment groups were 93% (42/45), 100% (31/31), and 79% (15/19), \nrespectively. Of the seven patients who did not achieve SVR12, none experienced virologic failure or \nrelapsed. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in HCV infected patients aged 3 years and above was evaluated \nin a Phase 2, open label clinical study that enrolled 226 patients: 221 patients with genotype 1, 2 \npatients with genotype 3, and 3 patients with genotype 4 CHC (Study 1116) (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nPatients aged 12 to < 18 Years: \nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 100 patients aged 12 to < 18 years with genotype 1 HCV \ninfection. A total of 80 patients (n=80) were treatment-na\u00efve, while 20 patients (n=20) were \ntreatment-experienced. All patients were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. \n \nDemographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment-na\u00efve and \ntreatment-experienced patients. The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 63% of the patients \nwere female; 91% were White, 7% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 13% were Hispanic/Latino; mean \nweight was 61.3 kg (range: 33.0 to 126.0 kg); 55% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or \nequal to 800,000 IU/mL; 81% had genotype 1a HCV infection; and 1 patient who was treatment na\u00efve \nwas known to have cirrhosis. The majority of patients (84%) had been infected through vertical \ntransmission. \n \nThe SVR12 rate was 98% overall (98% [78/80] in treatment-na\u00efve patients and 100% [20/20] in \ntreatment experienced patients). A total of 2 out of 100 patients (2%), both treatment- na\u00efve, did not \nachieve SVR12 (due to loss to follow-up). No patient experienced virologic failure. \n \nPatients aged 6 to < 12 Years:  \nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 92 patients aged 6 to < 12 years with genotype 1, 3, or 4 \nHCV-infection. A total of 72 patients (78%) were treatment-na\u00efve and 20 patients (22%) were \ntreatment-experienced. Eighty-nine of the patients (87 patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and 2 \npatients with genotype 4 HCV infection) were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, 1 \ntreatment experienced patient with genotype 1 HCV infection and cirrhosis was treated with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, and 2 treatment experienced patients with genotype 3 HCV \ninfection were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks.  \n \nThe median age was 9 years (range: 6 to 11); 59% of the patients were male; 79% were White, 8% \nwere Black, and 5% were Asian; 10% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was 32.8 kg (range: 17.5 to \n76.4 kg); 59% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000  IU/ mL; 84% had \ngenotype 1a HCV infection; 2 patients (1 treatment-na\u00efve, 1 treatment-experienced) had known \ncirrhosis. The majority of patients (97%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  \n \nThe SVR rate was 99% overall (99% [88/89], 100% [1/1], and 100% [2/2] in patients treated with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus \nribavirin for 24 weeks, respectively). The one treatment-na\u00efve patient with genotype 1 HCV infection \nand cirrhosis who was treated with Harvoni for 12 weeks did not achieve SVR12 and relapsed.  \n \nPatients aged 3 to < 6 Years:  \nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 34 patients aged 3 to < 6 years with genotype 1 (n = 33) or \ngenotype 4 (n = 1) HCV-infection. All of the patients were treatment-na\u00efve and treated with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The median age was 5 years (range: 3 to 5); 71% of the patients \nwere female; 79% were White, 3% were Black, and 6% were Asian; 18% were Hispanic/Latino; mean \nweight was 19.2 kg (range: 10.7 to 33.6 kg); 56% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal \nto 800,000 IU/ mL; 82% had genotype 1a HCV infection; no patients had known cirrhosis. All patients \n(100%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nThe SVR rate was 97% overall (97% [32/33] in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and 100% \n[1/1] in patients with genotype 4 HCV infection). One patient who prematurely discontinued study \ntreatment after five days due to abnormal taste of the medication did not achieve SVR. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to HCV-infected patients, ledipasvir median \npeak plasma concentration was observed at 4.0 hours post-dose. Sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and \nthe median peak plasma concentrations were observed ~ 1 hour post-dose. Median peak plasma \nconcentration of GS-331007 was observed at 4 hours post-dose. \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, geometric mean \nsteady-state AUC0-24 for ledipasvir (n = 2,113), sofosbuvir (n = 1,542), and GS-331007 (n = 2,113) \nwere 7,290, 1,320 and 12,000 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Steady-state Cmax for ledipasvir, sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007 were 323, 618 and 707 ng/mL, respectively. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 and Cmax \nwere similar in healthy adult subjects and patients with HCV infection. Relative to healthy subjects \n(n = 191), ledipasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax were 24% lower and 32% lower, respectively, in HCV-infected \npatients. Ledipasvir AUC is dose proportional over the dose range of 3 to 100 mg. Sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007 AUCs are near dose proportional over the dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg. \n \nEffects of food \nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with a \nmoderate fat or high fat meal increased the sofosbuvir AUC0-inf by approximately 2-fold, but did not \nsignificantly affect the sofosbuvir Cmax. The exposures to GS-331007 and ledipasvir were not altered in \nthe presence of either meal type. Harvoni can be administered without regard to food. \n \nDistribution \n \nLedipasvir is > 99.8% bound to human plasma proteins. After a single 90 mg dose of [14C]-ledipasvir \nin healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity ranged between 0.51 and 0.66. \n \nSofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent \nof drug concentration over the range of 1 \u00b5g/mL to 20 \u00b5g/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was \nminimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the \nblood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn vitro, no detectable metabolism of ledipasvir was observed by human CYP1A2, CYP2C8, \nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Evidence of slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown \nmechanism has been observed. Following a single dose of 90 mg [14C]-ledipasvir, systemic exposure \nwas almost exclusively due to the parent drug (> 98%). Unchanged ledipasvir is also the major species \npresent in faeces. \n \nSofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside \nanalogue triphosphate GS-461203. The active metabolite is not observed. The metabolic activation \npathway involves sequential hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A \nor carboxylesterase 1 and phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 \nfollowed by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation \nresults in the formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently \nrephosphorylated and lacks anti-HCV activity in vitro. Within ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, GS-331007 \naccounts for approximately 85% of total systemic exposure. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nElimination \n \nFollowing a single 90 mg oral dose of [14C]-ledipasvir, mean total recovery of the [14C]-radioactivity \nin faeces and urine was 87%, with most of the radioactive dose recovered from faeces (86%). \nUnchanged ledipasvir excreted in faeces accounted for a mean of 70% of the administered dose and \nthe oxidative metabolite M19 accounted for 2.2% of the dose. These data suggest that biliary excretion \nof unchanged ledipasvir is a major route of elimination with renal excretion being a minor pathway \n(approximately 1%). The median terminal half-life of ledipasvir in healthy volunteers following \nadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in the fasted state was 47 hours. \n \nFollowing a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater \nthan 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, and expired \nair, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while \n3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. This data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination \npathway for GS-331007 with a large part actively secreted. The median terminal half-lives of \nsofosbuvir and GS-331007 following administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir were 0.5 and 27 hours, \nrespectively. \n \nNeither ledipasvir nor sofosbuvir are substrates for hepatic uptake transporters, organic cation \ntransporter (OCT) 1, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OATP1B3. GS-331007 is \nnot a substrate for renal transporters including organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or OAT3, or OCT2. \n \nIn vitro potential for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to affect other medicinal products \n \nAt concentrations achieved in the clinic, ledipasvir is not an inhibitor of hepatic transporters including \nthe OATP 1B1 or 1B3, BSEP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, multidrug and toxic compound extrusion \n(MATE) 1 transporter, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 2 or MRP4. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are \nnot inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and \nGS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2 and MATE1. \n \nSofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP or uridine diphosphate \nglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzymes. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nRace and gender \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been identified for ledipasvir, \nsofosbuvir or GS-331007. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been \nidentified for sofosbuvir or GS-331007. AUC and Cmax of ledipasvir were 77% and 58% higher, \nrespectively, in females than males; however, the relationship between gender and ledipasvir \nexposures was not considered clinically relevant. \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients showed that within the age range (18 to \n80 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to ledipasvir, \nsofosbuvir or GS-331007. Clinical studies of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir included 235 patients (8.6% of total \nnumber of patients) aged 65 years and over. \n \nRenal impairment \nA summary of the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment (RI) on the exposures of the \ncomponents of Harvoni compared to subjects with normal renal function, as described in the text \nbelow, are provided in Table 21. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nTable 21: Effect of Varying Degrees of Renal Impairment on Exposures (AUC) of Sofosbuvir, GS-331007, \nand Ledipasvir Compared to Subjects with Normal Renal Function \n HCV-Negative Subjects HCV-Infected \n\nSubjects \nMild RI \n\n(eGFR \u226550 \nand \n\n<80 mL/ \nmin/ \n\n1.73m2) \n\nModerate RI \n(eGFR \u226530 \n\nand <50 mL/ \nmin/ \n\n1.73m2) \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n\n<30 mL/ \nmin/ \n\n1.73m2) \n\nESRD Requiring \nDialysis \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n\n<30 mL/ \nmin/ \n\n1.73m2) \n\nESRD \nRequiring \nDialysis Dosed \n\n1 hr \nBefore \nDialysis \n\nDosed \n1 hr After \nDialysis \n\nSofosbuvir 1.6-fold\u2191 2.1-fold\u2191 2.7-fold\u2191 1.3-fold\u2191 1.6-fold\u2191 ~2-fold\u2191 1.9-fold\u2191 \nGS-331007 1.6-fold\u2191 1.9-fold\u2191 5.5-fold\u2191 \u226510-fold\u2191 \u226520-fold\u2191 ~6-fold\u2191 23-fold\u2191 \nLedipasvir - - \u2194 - - - 1.6-fold\u2191 \n\u2194 indicates no clinically relevant change in the exposure of Ledipasvir. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in \nHCV negative adult patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault, \nmedian [range] CrCl 22 [17-29] mL/min).  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative adult patients with mild (eGFR \n\u2265 50 and < 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR \u2265 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal \nimpairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following \na single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir,relative to patients with normal renal function (eGFR \n> 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction \ncoefficient of approximately 53%. Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 hour \nhaemodialysis removed 18% of administered sofosbuvir dose. \n \nIn HCV-infected adult patients with severe renal impairment treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for \n12 weeks (n = 18), the pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were consistent \nwith that observed in HCV negative patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were studied in HCV-infected adult \npatients with ESRD requiring dialysis treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (n=94) for 8, 12, or 24 weeks, \nand compared to patients without renal impairment in the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir Phase 2/3 trials. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in \nHCV negative adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (CPT class C). Ledipasvir plasma \nexposure (AUCinf) was similar in patients with severe hepatic impairment and control patients with \nnormal hepatic function. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected adult patients \nindicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the \nexposure to ledipasvir. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in \nHCV-infected adult patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT class B and C). \nRelative to patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher \nin moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and 9% higher, \nrespectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected patients indicated that cirrhosis \n(including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir \nand GS-331007. \n \nBody weight \nBody weight did not have a significant effect on sofosbuvir exposure according to a population \npharmacokinetic analysis. Exposure to ledipasvir decreases with increasing body weight but the effect \nis not considered to be clinically relevant. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nPaediatric population \nLedipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 exposures in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above were \nsimilar to those in adults from Phase 2/3 studies, following administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. \nThe 90% confidence intervals of geometric least-squares mean ratios for all PK parameters of interest \nwere contained within the predetermined similarity bounds of less than 2-fold (50% to 200%) with the \nexception of ledipasvir Ctau in paediatric patients 12 years and above which was 84% higher (90%CI: \n168% to 203%) and was not considered clinically relevant. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 have not been established in \npaediatric patients aged < 3 years (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nLedipasvir \n \nNo target organs of toxicity were identified in rat and dog studies with ledipasvir at AUC exposures \napproximately 7 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. \n \nLedipasvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nLedipasvir was not carcinogenic in the 26-week rasH2 transgenic mouse and the 2-year rat \ncarcinogenicity studies at exposures up to 26-times in mice and 8-times in rats higher than human \nexposure. \n \nLedipasvir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility. In female rats, the mean number of corpora \nlutea and implantation sites were slightly reduced at maternal exposures 6-fold the exposure in humans \nat the recommended clinical dose. At the no observed effect level, AUC exposure to ledipasvir was \napproximately 7- and 3-fold, in males and females, respectively, the human exposure at the \nrecommended clinical dose. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were observed in rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies with ledipasvir. \n \nIn a rat pre- and postnatal study, at a maternally toxic dose, the developing rat offspring exhibited \nmean decreased body weight and body weight gain when exposed in utero (via maternal dosing) and \nduring lactation (via maternal milk) at a maternal exposure 4 times the exposure in humans at the \nrecommended clinical dose. There were no effects on survival, physical and behavioural development \nand reproductive performance in the offspring at maternal exposures similar to the exposure in humans \nat the recommended clinical dose. \n \nWhen administered to lactating rats, ledipasvir was detected in plasma of suckling rats likely due to \nexcretion of ledipasvir via milk. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA) \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that ledipasvir has the potential to be very \npersistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) in the environment (see section 6.6). \n \nSofosbuvir \n \nIn repeat dose toxicology studies in rat and dog, high doses of the 1:1 diastereomeric mixture caused \nadverse liver (dog) and heart (rat) effects and gastrointestinal reactions (dog). Exposure to sofosbuvir \nin rodent studies could not be detected likely due to high esterase activity; however, exposure to the \nmajor metabolite GS-331007 at doses which cause adverse effects was 16 times (rat) and 71 times \n(dog) higher than the clinical exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. No liver or heart findings were observed \nin chronic toxicity studies at exposures 5 times (rat) and 16 times (dog) higher than the clinical \n\n\n\n38 \n\nexposure. No liver or heart findings were observed in the 2-year carcinogenicity studies at exposures \n17 times (mouse) and 9 times (rat) higher than the clinical exposure. \n \nSofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies in mice and rats do not indicate any carcinogenicity potential of sofosbuvir \nadministered at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mouse and 750 mg/kg/day in rat. Exposure to \nGS-331007 in these studies was up to 17 times (mouse) and 9 times (rat) higher than the clinical \nexposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. \n \nSofosbuvir had no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility in rat and was not teratogenic in rat \nand rabbit development studies. No adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction or development of \noffspring in rat were reported. In rabbit studies exposure to sofosbuvir was 6 times the expected \nclinical exposure. In the rat studies, exposure to sofosbuvir could not be determined but exposure \nmargins based on the major human metabolite was approximately 5 times higher than the clinical \nexposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. \n \nSofosbuvir-derived material was transferred through the placenta in pregnant rats and into the milk of \nlactating rats. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHarvoni is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in adult and paediatric patients \naged 3 years and above (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nFor hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-specific activity see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHarvoni treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management of \npatients with CHC. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Harvoni in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above is based on weight \n(as detailed in Table 2) and can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nTable 1: Recommended treatment duration for Harvoni and the recommended use of co-administered \nribavirin for certain subgroups \nPatient population \n(including HIV co-infected patients) \n\nTreatment and duration \n\nAdult and paediatric patients aged 3 years and abovea with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 CHC \n\nPatients without cirrhosis \n\nHarvoni for 12 weeks. \n- Harvoni for 8 weeks may be considered in previously \n\nuntreated genotype 1-infected patients (see section 5.1, \nION-3 study). \n\nPatients with compensated cirrhosis \n\nHarvoni + ribavirinb,c for 12 weeks \nor \nHarvoni (without ribavirin) for 24 weeks. \n \n- Harvoni (without ribavirin) for 12 weeks may be \n\nconsidered for patients deemed at low risk for clinical \ndisease progression and who have subsequent retreatment \noptions (see section 4.4). \n\nPatients who are post-liver transplant \nwithout cirrhosis or with compensated \ncirrhosis \n\nHarvoni + ribavirinb,c for 12 weeks (see section 5.1). \n- Harvoni (without ribavirin) for 12 weeks (in patients \n\nwithout cirrhosis) or 24 weeks (in patients with cirrhosis) \nmay be considered for patients who are ineligible for or \nintolerant to ribavirin. \n\nPatients with decompensated cirrhosis \nirrespective of transplant status \n\nHarvoni + ribavirind for 12 weeks (see section 5.1) \n- Harvoni (without ribavirin) for 24 weeks may be \n\nconsidered in patients who are ineligible for or intolerant \nto ribavirin. \n\nAdult and paediatric patients aged 3 years and abovea with genotype 3 CHC \n\nPatients with compensated cirrhosis and/or \nprior treatment failure Harvoni + ribavirin\n\nb for 24 weeks (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\na See Table 2 for weight-based Harvoni dosing recommendations for paediatric patients aged 3 years and above. \nb Adults: weight-based ribavirin (< 75 kg = 1,000 mg and \u2265 75 kg = 1,200 mg), administered orally in two divided doses \n\nwith food. \nc Paediatric patients: for ribavirin dosing recommendations see Table 4 below. \nd  For ribavirin dosing recommendations in adult patients with decompensated cirrhosis, see Table 3 below. \n \nTable 2: Dosing for paediatric patients aged 3 years and above using Harvoni oral granules* \nBody Weight (kg)  Dosing of Oral Granules in Sachet Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir Daily Dose \n\n\u2265 35 two 45 mg/200 mg sachets of \ngranules once daily \n\n90 mg/400 mg/day  \n\n17 to < 35  one 45 mg/200 mg sachet of \ngranules once daily \n\n45 mg/200 mg/day  \n\n< 17  one 33.75 mg/150 mg sachet of \ngranules once daily  \n\n33.75 mg/150 mg/day  \n\n* Harvoni is also available as 45 mg/200 mg and 90 mg/400 mg film-coated tablets (see section 5.1). Please refer to the \nSummaries of Product Characteristics for Harvoni film-coated tablets. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nTable 3: Guidance for ribavirin dosing when administered with Harvoni to adult patients with \ndecompensated cirrhosis \nPatient Ribavirin dose* \nChild-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) Class B \ncirrhosis pre-transplant \n\n1,000 mg per day for patients < 75 kg and 1,200 mg for those \nweighing \u2265 75 kg \n\nCPT Class C cirrhosis pre-transplant \n \nCPT Class B or C cirrhosis post-\ntransplant \n \n\nStarting dose of 600 mg, which can be titrated up to a maximum \nof 1,000/1,200 mg (1,000 mg for patients weighing < 75 kg and \n1,200 mg for patients weighing \u2265 75 kg) if well tolerated.  If the \nstarting dose is not well tolerated, the dose should be reduced as \nclinically indicated based on haemoglobin levels \n\n* - If a more normalized dose of ribavirin (by weight and renal function) cannot be reached for reasons of tolerability, \n24 weeks of Harvoni + ribavirin should be considered in order to minimize the risk for relapse. \n \nFor adults when ribavirin is added to Harvoni, refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \nribavirin. \n \nIn paediatric patients aged 3 years and above the following ribavirin dosing is recommended where \nribavirin is divided into two daily doses and given with food: \n \nTable 4: Guidance for ribavirin dosing when administered with Harvoni to paediatric patients aged \n3 years and above. \n\nBody weight kg Ribavirin Dose* \n< 47 15 mg/kg/day \n47-49 600 mg/day \n50-65 800 mg/day \n66-74 1000 mg/day \n> or = 75 1200 mg/day \n\n* The daily dosage of ribavirin is weight-based and administered orally in two divided doses with food. \n \nDose modification of ribavirin in adults taking 1,000-1,200 mg daily \nIf Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin and a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially \nrelated to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be modified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the \nadverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. Table 5 provides guidelines for dose modifications \nand discontinuation based on the patient\u2019s haemoglobin concentration and cardiac status. \n \nTable 5: Ribavirin dose modification guideline for co-administration with Harvoni in adults \n\nLaboratory values Reduce ribavirin dose to \n600 mg/day if: \n\nDiscontinue ribavirin if: \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with no \ncardiac disease \n\n< 10 g/dL < 8.5 g/dL \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with history \nof stable cardiac disease \n\n\u2265 2 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin \nduring any 4-week treatment \nperiod \n\n< 12 g/dL despite 4 weeks at \nreduced dose \n\n \nOnce ribavirin has been withheld due to either a laboratory abnormality or clinical manifestation, an \nattempt may be made to restart ribavirin at 600 mg daily and further increase the dose to 800 mg daily.  \nHowever, it is not recommended that ribavirin be increased to the originally assigned dose (1,000 mg \nto 1,200 mg daily). \n \nPaediatric population aged < 3 years \nThe safety and efficacy of Harvoni in paediatric patients aged < 3 years have not been established.  No \ndata are available. \n \nMissed dose \nPatients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 5 hours of dosing an additional dose \nshould be taken.  If vomiting occurs more than 5 hours after dosing, no further dose is needed (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nIf a dose is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be instructed to take \nthe additional dose as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at the usual time. If \nit is after 18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose at the usual time.  \nPatients should be instructed not to take a double dose. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Harvoni is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.   \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate \n[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. Harvoni can be \nused in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available \n(see section 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Harvoni is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte [CPT] class A, B or C) (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir have been established in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \nHarvoni can be taken either with or without food. \n \nTo help with swallowing of the Harvoni oral granules you can use food or water as detailed below. \nAlternatively, Harvoni can be swallowed without food or water. \n \nTaking Harvoni granules with food to aid swallowing \nTo administer with food to aid swallowability of the granules, patients should be instructed to sprinkle \nthe granules on one or more spoonfuls of non-acidic soft food at or below room temperature. Patients \nshould be instructed to take the Harvoni granules within 30 minutes of gently mixing with food and to \nswallow the entire contents without chewing to avoid a bitter taste. Examples of non-acidic foods \ninclude chocolate syrup, mashed potato, and ice-cream.  \n \nTaking Harvoni granules with water to aid swallowing \nTo administer with water, patients should be instructed that the granules can be taken directly into the \nmouth and swallowed with water.  \n \nTaking Harvoni granules without food or water \nTo administer without food or water, patients should be instructed that the granules can be taken \ndirectly into the mouth and swallowed. Patients should be instructed to swallow the entire contents \nwithout chewing (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration with rosuvastatin (see section 4.5). \n \nUse with strong P-gp inducers \n \nMedicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducers in the intestine (carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John\u2019s wort). Co-administration will \n\n\n\n44 \n\nsignificantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and could result in loss of \nefficacy of Harvoni (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHarvoni should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing \nsofosbuvir. \n \nGenotype-specific activity \n \nConcerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning \ngenotype-specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1. \n \nThe clinical data to support the use of Harvoni in adults infected with HCV genotype 3 are limited (see \nsection 5.1). The relative efficacy of a 12-week regimen consisting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir \n+ ribavirin, compared to a 24-week regimen of sofosbuvir + ribavirin has not been investigated. A \nconservative 24 weeks of therapy is advised in all treatment-experienced genotype 3 patients and those \ntreatment-na\u00efve genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis (see section 4.2). In genotype 3-infection, the use of \nHarvoni (always in combination with ribavirin) should only be considered for patients who are \ndeemed at high risk for clinical disease progression and who do not have alternative treatment options. \n \nThe clinical data to support the use of Harvoni in adults infected with HCV genotype 2 and 6 are \nlimited (see section 5.1). \n \nSevere bradycardia and heart block \n \nLife-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-\ncontaining regimens are used in combination with amiodarone. Bradycardia has generally occurred \nwithin hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks \nafter initiating HCV treatment. \n \nAmiodarone should only be used in patients on Harvoni when other alternative anti-arrhythmic \ntreatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. \n \nShould concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary it is recommended that patients \nundergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after \nwhich outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the \nfirst 2 weeks of treatment. \n \nDue to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried \nout for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated \non Harvoni. \n \nAll patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of \nbradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they \nexperience them. \n \nUse in diabetic patients  \n \nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic \npatients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the \nfirst 3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the \ndiabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct-acting antiviral therapy is initiated. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \nHCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection \n \nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before \ninitiation of treatment.  HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should \ntherefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. \n \nTreatment of patients with prior exposure to HCV direct-acting antivirals \n \nIn patients who fail treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, selection of NS5A resistance mutations that \nsubstantially reduce the susceptibility to ledipasvir is seen in the majority of cases (see section 5.1). \nLimited data indicate that such NS5A mutations do not revert on long-term follow-up.  There are \npresently no data to support the effectiveness of retreatment of patients who have failed \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir with a subsequent regimen that contains an NS5A inhibitor. Similarly, there are \npresently no data to support the effectiveness of NS3/4A protease inhibitors in patients who previously \nfailed prior therapy that included an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Such patients may therefore be \ndependent on other classes of medicinal products for clearance of HCV infection. Consequently, \nconsideration should be given to longer treatment for patients with uncertain subsequent retreatment \noptions. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate \n[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and ESRD requiring haemodialysis. Harvoni can be used in these \npatients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are available (see \nsections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). When Harvoni is used in combination with ribavirin refer also to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) \n< 50 mL/min (see section 5.2). \n \nAdults with decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant \n \nThe efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in genotype 5 and genotype 6 HCV-infected patients with \ndecompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant has not been \ninvestigated. Treatment with Harvoni should be guided by an assessment of the potential benefits and \nrisks for the individual patient. \n \nUse with moderate P-gp inducers \n \nMedicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. oxcarbazepine) may decrease \nledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Harvoni.  \nCo-administration of such medicinal products is not recommended with Harvoni (see section 4.5). \n \nUse with certain HIV antiretroviral regimens \n \nHarvoni has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure, especially when used together with an HIV \nregimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or \ncobicistat). The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Harvoni and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with \nco-administration of Harvoni with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing \nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \ngiven in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be \nconsidered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving Harvoni \nconcomitantly with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or with \ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for tenofovir-\nassociated adverse reactions. Refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil \n\n\n\n46 \n\nfumarate, or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring. \n \nUse with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors \n \nCo-administration of Harvoni and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can significantly increase \nthe concentration of the statin, which increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nHarvoni is not recommended for use in paediatric patients aged < 3 years because the safety and \nefficacy have not been established in this population. \n \nExcipients \n \nHarvoni contains the azo colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110), which may cause allergic \nreactions. It also contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs Harvoni contains ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, any interactions that have been identified with these \nactive substances individually may occur with Harvoni. \n \nPotential for Harvoni to affect other medicinal products \n \nLedipasvir is an in vitro inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) \nand may increase intestinal absorption of co-administered substrates for these transporters.   \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect Harvoni \n \nLedipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporter P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. \n \nMedicinal products that are strong P-gp inducers (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, \nrifampicin, rifabutin and St. John\u2019s wort) may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma \nconcentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and thus are \ncontraindicated with Harvoni (see section 4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in \nthe intestine (e.g. oxcarbazepine) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations \nleading to reduced therapeutic effect of Harvoni. Co-administration with such medicinal products is \nnot recommended with Harvoni (see section 4.4). Co-administration with medicinal products that \ninhibit P-gp and/or BCRP may increase ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations without \nincreasing GS-331007 plasma concentration; Harvoni may be co-administered with P-gp and/or \nBCRP inhibitors.  Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir \nmediated by CYP450s or UGT1A1 enzymes are not expected. \n \nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \n \nAs liver function may change during treatment with Harvoni, a close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. \n \nImpact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such \nas calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to \nclearance of HCV virus. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nInteractions between Harvoni and other medicinal products \n \nTable 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product \ninteractions (where 90% confidence interval [CI] of the geometric least-squares mean [GLSM] ratio \nwere within \u201c\u2194\u201d, extended above \u201c\u2191\u201d, or extended below \u201c\u2193\u201d the predetermined equivalence \nboundaries).

Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal \neffects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. Women of childbearing \npotential or their male partners must use an effective form of contraception during treatment and for a \nperiod of time after the treatment has concluded as recommended in the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for ribavirin. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for \nadditional information. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ledipasvir, \nsofosbuvir or Harvoni in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. No \nsignificant effects on foetal development have been observed with ledipasvir or sofosbuvir in rats and \nrabbits. However, it has not been possible to fully estimate exposure margins achieved for sofosbuvir \nin the rat relative to the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Harvoni during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ledipasvir or sofosbuvir and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n \nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals has shown excretion of ledipasvir and metabolites of \nsofosbuvir in milk (see section 5.3). \n \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, Harvoni should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Harvoni on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of ledipasvir or sofosbuvir on fertility. \n \nIf ribavirin is co-administered with Harvoni, the contraindications regarding use of ribavirin during \npregnancy and breast-feeding apply (see also the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHarvoni (administered alone or in combination with ribavirin) has no or negligible influence on the \nability to drive and use machines. However, patients should be advised that fatigue was more common \nin patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir compared to placebo. \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile in adults \nThe safety assessment of Harvoni was mainly based on pooled Phase 3 clinical studies, without a \ncontrol, in 1952 patients who received Harvoni for 8, 12 or 24 weeks, including 872 patients who \nreceived Harvoni in combination with ribavirin. \n \nThe proportion of patients who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0%, \n< 1% and 1% for patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively; and \n< 1%, 0%, and 2% for patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin combination therapy for 8, \n12 and 24 weeks, respectively. \n \nIn clinical studies, fatigue and headache were more common in patients treated with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir compared to placebo. When ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was studied with ribavirin, the \nmost frequent adverse drug reactions to ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin combination therapy were \nconsistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin, without increasing the frequency or severity of \nthe expected adverse drug reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse events \n \nThe following adverse drug reactions have been identified with Harvoni (Table 7). The adverse \nreactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are defined as \nfollows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTable 7: Adverse drug reactions identified with Harvoni \nFrequency Adverse drug reaction \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common headache \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nCommon rash \nNot known angioedema \nGeneral disorders: \nVery common fatigue \n \nAdults with decompensated cirrhosis and/or who are awaiting liver transplant or post-liver transplant \n \nThe safety profile of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks in adults with \ndecompensated liver disease and/or those post-liver transplant was assessed in two open-label studies \n(SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2). No new adverse drug reactions were detected among patients with \ndecompensated cirrhosis and/or who were post-liver transplant and who received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir \nwith ribavirin. Although adverse events, including serious adverse events, occurred more frequently in \nthis study compared to studies that excluded decompensated patients and/or patients who were post-\nliver transplantation, the adverse events observed were those expected as clinical sequelae of advanced \nliver disease and/or transplantation or were consistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin (see \nsection 5.1 for details of this study). \n \nDecreases in haemoglobin to < 10 g/dL and < 8.5 g/dL during treatment were experienced by 39% and \n13% of patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin, respectively. Ribavirin was \ndiscontinued in 15% of the patients. \n \n7% of liver transplant recipients had a modification of their immunosuppressive agents. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir was administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients with genotype 1 CHC and severe \nrenal impairment in an open-label study (Study 0154). In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate \nof adverse events was not clearly elevated from what is expected in patients with severe renal \nimpairment. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \nThe safety of Harvoni has been evaluated in a 12-week non-controlled study including 95 patients \nwith ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4063). In this setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-\n331007 is 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have been observed in \npreclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and deaths was not \nclearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Harvoni in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above are based on data \nfrom a Phase 2, open-label clinical study (Study 1116) that enrolled 226 patients who were treated \nwith ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 or 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks.  \nThe adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir in adults (see Table 7). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac arrhythmias \nCases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when Harvoni is used with \namiodarone and/or other drugs that lower heart rate (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nSkin disorders \nFrequency not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest documented doses of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir were 120 mg twice daily for 10 days and a \nsingle dose of 1,200 mg, respectively. In these healthy volunteer studies, there were no untoward \neffects observed at these dose levels, and adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity to \nthose reported in the placebo groups. The effects of higher doses are not known. \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with Harvoni.  If overdose occurs the patient must be \nmonitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with Harvoni consists of general supportive \nmeasures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \nHaemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of ledipasvir as ledipasvir is highly bound to \nplasma protein. Haemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of \nsofosbuvir, GS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Direct-acting antiviral, ATC code: J05AP51 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLedipasvir is a HCV inhibitor targeting the HCV NS5A protein, which is essential for both RNA \nreplication and the assembly of HCV virions. Biochemical confirmation of NS5A inhibition by \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n61 \n\nledipasvir is not currently possible as NS5A has no enzymatic function. In vitro resistance selection \nand cross-resistance studies indicate ledipasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action. \n \nSofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is \nessential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular \nmetabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analogue triphosphate (GS-461203), which \ncan be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator.  \nGS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and \nRNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. \n \nAntiviral activity \n \nThe EC50 values of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding NS5A \nand NS5B sequences from clinical isolates are detailed in Table 8. The presence of 40% human serum \nhad no effect on the anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir but reduced the anti-HCV activity of ledipasvir \nby 12-fold against genotype 1a HCV replicons. \n \nTable 8: Activity of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir against chimeric replicons \nGenotype \nreplicons \n\nLedipasvir activity (EC50, nM) Sofosbuvir activity (EC50, nM) \nStable replicons NS5A transient \n\nreplicons \nMedian (range)a \n\nStable replicons NS5B transient \nreplicons \nMedian (range)a \n\nGenotype 1a 0.031 0.018 (0.009-0.085) 40 62 (29-128) \nGenotype 1b 0.004 0.006 (0.004-0.007) 110 102 (45-170) \nGenotype 2a 21-249 - 50 29 (14-81) \nGenotype 2b 16-530b - 15b - \nGenotype 3a 168 - 50 81 (24-181) \nGenotype 4a 0.39 - 40 - \nGenotype 4d 0.60 - - - \nGenotype 5a 0.15b - 15b - \nGenotype 6a 1.1b - 14b - \nGenotype 6e 264b - - - \na. Transient replicons carrying NS5A or NS5B from patient isolates. \nb. The chimeric replicons carrying NS5A genes from genotype 2b, 5a, 6a and 6e were used for testing ledipasvir while the \nchimeric replicons carrying NS5B genes from genotype 2b, 5a or 6a were used for testing sofosbuvir. \n \nResistance \n \nIn cell culture \nHCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir have been selected in cell culture for \ngenotype 1a and 1b. Reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir was associated with the primary NS5A \nsubstitution Y93H in both genotype 1a and 1b. Additionally a Q30E substitution developed in \ngenotype 1a replicons.  Site-directed mutagenesis of NS5A RAVs showed that substitutions conferring \na fold-change > 100 and \u2264 1,000 in ledipasvir susceptibility are Q30H/R, L31I/M/V, P32L and Y93T \nin genotype 1a and P58D and Y93S in genotype 1b; and substitutions conferring a fold-change \n> 1,000 are M28A/G, Q30E/G/K, H58D, Y93C/H/N/S in genotype 1a and A92K and Y93H in \ngenotype 1b. \n \nHCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple \ngenotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a.  Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated \nwith the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined. Site-directed \nmutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of 8 genotypes conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced \nsusceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the viral replication capacity by 89% to 99% compared to the \ncorresponding wild-type. \n \nIn clinical studies \u2013 Adults-Genotype 1 \nIn a pooled analysis of patients who received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in Phase 3 studies (ION-3, ION-1 \nand ION-2), 37 patients (29 with genotype 1a and 8 with genotype 1b) qualified for resistance analysis \n\n\n\n62 \n\ndue to virologic failure or early study drug discontinuation and having HCV RNA > 1,000 IU/mL.  \nPost-baseline NS5A and NS5B deep sequencing data (assay cut off of 1%) were available for 37/37 \nand 36/37 patients, respectively. \n \nNS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were observed in post-baseline isolates from \n29/37 patients (22/29 genotype 1a and 7/8 genotype 1b) not achieving sustained virologic response \n(SVR). Of the 29 genotype 1a patients who qualified for resistance testing, 22/29 (76%) patients \nharboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions K24, M28, Q30, L31, S38 and Y93 at failure, while \nthe remaining 7/29 patients had no NS5A RAVs detected at failure. The most common variants were \nQ30R, Y93H and L31M.  Of the 8 genotype 1b patients who qualified for resistance testing, 7/8 (88%) \nharboured one or more NS5A RAVs at positions L31 and Y93 at failure, while 1/8 patients had no \nNS5A RAVs at failure. The most common variant was Y93H.  Among the 8 patients who had no \nNS5A RAVs at failure, 7 patients received 8 weeks of treatment (n = 3 with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir; \nn = 4 with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin) and 1 patient received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. \nIn phenotypic analyses, post-baseline isolates from patients who harboured NS5A RAVs at failure \nshowed 20- to at least a 243-fold (the highest dose tested) reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir. \nSite-directed mutagenesis of the Y93H substitution in both genotype 1a and 1b as well as the Q30R \nand L31M substitution in genotype 1a conferred high levels of reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir \n(fold-change in EC50 ranging from 544-fold to 1,677-fold). \n \nAmong post-transplant patients with compensated liver disease or patients with decompensated liver \ndisease either pre- or post-transplant (SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies), relapse was associated with \nthe detection of one or more of the following NS5A RAVs: K24R, M28T, Q30R/H/K, L31V, H58D \nand Y93H/C in 12/14 genotype 1a patients, and L31M, Y93H/N in 6/6 genotype 1b patients. \n \nA NS5B substitution E237G was detected in 3 patients (1 genotype 1b and 2 genotype 1a) in the \nPhase 3 studies (ION-3, ION-1 and ION-2) and 3 patients with genotype 1a infection in the SOLAR-1 \nand SOLAR-2 studies at the time of relapse. The E237G substitution showed a 1.3-fold reduction in \nsusceptibility to sofosbuvir in the genotype 1a replicon assay. The clinical significance of this \nsubstitution is currently unknown. \n \nThe sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B was not detected in any virologic \nfailure isolate from the Phase 3 studies.  However, the NS5B S282T substitution in combination with \nNS5A substitutions L31M, Y93H and Q30L were detected in one patient at failure following 8 weeks \nof treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir from a Phase 2 study (LONESTAR). This patient was \nsubsequently retreated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks and achieved SVR \nfollowing retreatment. \n \nIn the SIRIUS study (see \u201cClinical efficacy and safety\u201d, below) 5 patients with genotype 1 infection \nrelapsed after treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin.  NS5A RAVs were seen \nat relapse in 5/5 patients (for genotype 1a: Q30R/H + L31M/V [n = 1] and Q30R [n = 1]; for \ngenotype 1b: Y93H [n = 3]). \n \nIn clinical studies \u2013 Adults-Genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 \nNS5A RAVs: No genotype 2 infected patients experienced relapse in the clinical study and therefore \nthere are no data regarding NS5A RAVs at the time of failure. \n \nIn genotype 3 infected patients experiencing virologic failure, development of NS5A RAVs (including \nenrichment of RAVs present at baseline) was typically not detected at the time of failure (n = 17). \n \nIn genotype 4, 5 and 6 infection, only small numbers of patients have been evaluated (total of \n5 patients with failure). The NS5A substitution Y93C emerged in the HCV of 1 patient (genotype 4), \nwhile NS5A RAVs present at baseline were observed at the time of failure in all patients. In the \nSOLAR-2 study, one patient with genotype 4d developed NS5B substitution E237G at the time of \nrelapse. The clinical significance of this substitution is currently unknown. \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nNS5B RAVs: The NS5B substitution S282T emerged in the HCV of 1/17 genotype 3-failures, and in \nthe HCV of 1/3, 1/1 and 1/1 of genotype 4-, 5- and 6-failures, respectively. \n \nEffect of baseline HCV resistance-associated variants on treatment outcome \n \nAdults-Genotype 1 \nAnalyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and \ntreatment outcome. In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 studies, 16% of patients had baseline \nNS5A RAVs identified by population or deep sequencing irrespective of subtype. Baseline \nNS5A RAVs were overrepresented in patients who experienced relapse in the Phase 3 studies (see \n\u201cClinical efficacy and safety\u201d). \n \nFollowing 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (without ribavirin) in treatment-\nexperienced patients (arm 1 of ION-2 study) 4/4 patients with baseline NS5A RAVs conferring a \nledipasvir fold-change of \u2264 100 achieved SVR. For the same treatment arm, patients with baseline \nNS5A RAVs conferring a fold-change of > 100, relapse occurred in 4/13 (31%), as compared to 3/95 \n(3%) in those without any baseline RAVs or RAVs conferring a fold-change of \u2264 100. \n \nFollowing 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin in treatment-experienced \npatients with compensated cirrhosis (SIRIUS, n = 77), 8/8 patients with baseline NS5A RAVs \nconferring > 100-fold reduced susceptibility to ledipasvir achieved SVR12. \n \nAmong post-transplant patients with compensated liver disease (SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies), no \nrelapse occurred in patients with baseline NS5A RAVs (n = 23) following 12 weeks of treatment with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin. Among patients with decompensated liver disease (pre- and post-\ntransplant), 4/16 (25%) patients with NS5A RAVs conferring > 100-fold resistance relapsed after \n12 weeks treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin compared to 7/120 (6%) in those without \nany baseline NS5A RAVs or RAVs conferring a fold-change of \u2264 100. \n \nThe group of NS5A RAVs that conferred > 100-fold shift and was observed in patients were the \nfollowing substitutions in genotype 1a (M28A, Q30H/R/E, L31M/V/I, H58D, Y93H/N/C) or in \ngenotype 1b (Y93H). The proportion of such baseline NS5A RAVs seen with deep sequencing varied \nfrom very low (cut off for assay = 1%) to high (main part of the plasma population). \n \nThe sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B \nsequence of any patient in Phase 3 studies by population or deep sequencing.  SVR was achieved in all \n24 patients (n = 20 with L159F+C316N; n = 1 with L159F; and n = 3 with N142T) who had baseline \nvariants associated with resistance to NS5B nucleoside inhibitors. \n \nAdults-Genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 \nDue to the limited size of studies, the impact of baseline NS5A RAVs on treatment outcome for \npatients with genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 CHC has not been fully evaluated. No major differences in \noutcomes were observed by the presence or absence of baseline NS5A RAVs. \n \nPaediatric Patients \n \nThe presence of pre-treatment NS5A and/or NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome as all \nsubjects with pre-treatment RAVs achieved SVR12 and SVR24. One 8-year-old subject infected with \ngenotype 1a HCV who failed to achieve SVR12 had no NS5A or NS5B nucleoside inhibitor RAVs at \nbaseline and had emergent NS5A RAV Y93H at relapse. \n \nCross-resistance \n \nLedipasvir was fully active against the sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B \nwhile all ledipasvir resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A were fully susceptible to sofosbuvir. \nBoth sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to \nother classes of direct-acting antivirals with different mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B \n\n\n\n64 \n\nnon-nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors. NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to \nledipasvir may reduce the antiviral activity of other NS5A inhibitors. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of ledipasvir [LDV]/sofosbuvir [SOF] was evaluated in three open-label Phase 3 studies \nwith data available for a total of 1,950 patients with genotype 1 CHC. The three Phase 3 studies \nincluded one study conducted in non-cirrhotic treatment-na\u00efve patients (ION-3); one study in cirrhotic \nand non-cirrhotic treatment-na\u00efve patients (ION-1); and one study in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic \npatients who failed prior therapy with an interferon-based regimen, including regimens containing an \nHCV protease inhibitor (ION-2). Patients in these studies had compensated liver disease. All three \nPhase 3 studies evaluated the efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin. \n \nTreatment duration was fixed in each study.  Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the \nclinical studies using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System.  \nThe assay had a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU/mL. SVR was the primary endpoint to \ndetermine the HCV cure rate which was defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the \ncessation of treatment. \n \nTreatment-na\u00efve adults without cirrhosis \u2013 ION-3 (study 0108) \u2013 Genotype 1 \nION-3 evaluated 8 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin and \n12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in treatment-na\u00efve non-cirrhotic patients with \ngenotype 1 CHC. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups and \nstratified by HCV genotype (1a versus 1b). \n \nTable 9: Demographics and baseline characteristics in study ION-3 \nPatient disposition LDV/SOF \n\n8 weeks \n(n = 215) \n\nLDV/SOF+RBV \n8 weeks \n(n = 216) \n\nLDV/SOF \n12 weeks \n(n = 216) \n\nTOTAL \n \n(n = 647) \n\nAge (years): median (range) 53 (22-75) 51 (21-71) 53 (20-71) 52 (20-75) \nMale gender 60% (130)  54% (117) 59% (128) 58% (375) \nRace: Black/ African American 21% (45) 17% (36) 19% (42) 19% (123) \n White 76% (164) 81% (176) 77% (167) 78% (507) \nGenotype 1a 80% (171) 80% (172) 80% (172) 80% (515)a \nIL28CC genotype 26% (56) 28% (60) 26% (56) 27% (172) \nFibroTest-Determined Metavir scoreb \n F0-F1 33% (72) 38% (81) 33% (72) 35% (225) \n F2 30% (65) 28% (61) 30% (65) 30% (191) \n F3-F4 36% (77) 33% (71) 37% (79) 35% (227) \n Not interpretable < 1% (1) 1% (3) 0% (0) < 1% (4) \na One patient in the LDV/SOF 8-week treatment arm did not have a confirmed genotype 1 subtype. \nb Non-missing FibroTest results are mapped to Metavir scores according to: 0-0.31 = F0-F1; 0.32-0.58 = F2; \n\n0.59-1.00 = F3-F4. \n \nTable 10: Response rates in study ION-3 \n LDV/SOF \n\n8 weeks \n(n = 215) \n\nLDV/SOF+RBV \n8 weeks \n(n = 216) \n\nLDV/SOF \n12 weeks \n(n = 216) \n\nSVR 94% (202/215) 93% (201/216) 96% (208/216) \nOutcome for patients without SVR \n On-treatment virologic failure 0/215 0/216 0/216 \n Relapsea 5% (11/215) 4% (9/214) 1% (3/216) \n Otherb < 1% (2/215) 3% (6/216) 2% (5/216) \nGenotype \n Genotype 1a 93% (159/171) 92% (159/172) 96% (165/172) \n Genotype 1b 98% (42/43) 95% (42/44) 98% (43/44) \na The denominator for relapse is the number of patients with HCV RNA < LLOQ at their last on-treatment assessment. \nb Other includes patients who did not achieve SVR and did not meet virologic failure criteria (e.g. lost to follow-up). \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nThe 8-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin was non-inferior to the 8-week \ntreatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin (treatment difference 0.9%; 95% confidence interval: \n-3.9% to 5.7%) and the 12-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (treatment difference -2.3%; 97.5% \nconfidence interval: -7.2% to 3.6%).

In study 1118, 44 patients with genotype 1 \ninfection, including 12 cirrhotic patients, who had previously failed treatment with sofosbuvir + \nribavirin + PEG-IFN or with sofosbuvir + ribavirin were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin \nfor 12 weeks; the SVR was 100% (44/44). In study ION-4, 13 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients with \ngenotype 1, including 1 cirrhotic patient, who had failed a sofosbuvir + ribavirin regimen were \nenrolled; the SVR was 100% (13/13) after 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. \n \nHCV/HIV co-infected adults \u2013 ION-4 \nION-4 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment \nwith ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin in HCV treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced \npatients with genotype 1 or 4 CHC who were co-infected with HIV-1. Treatment-experienced patients \nhad failed prior treatment with PEG-IFN + ribavirin \u00b1 an HCV protease inhibitor or sofosbuvir + \nribavirin \u00b1 PEG-IFN.  Patients were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy that included \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, administered with efavirenz, rilpivirine or raltegravir. \n \nThe median age was 52 years (range: 26 to 72); 82% of the patients were male; 61% were white; 34% \nwere black; 75% had genotype 1a HCV infection; 2% had genotype 4 infection; 76% had non-CC \nIL28B alleles (CT or TT); and 20% had compensated cirrhosis.

For genotype 3 infection, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was given with or \nwithout ribavirin, also for 12 weeks (Table 20). \n \nTable 19: Response rates (SVR12) with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks in patients with genotype 2, 4, 5 \nand 6 HCV infection \nStudy GT n TEa SVR12 Relapseb \n\nOverall Cirrhosis  \nStudy 1468 (LEPTON) 2 26 19% (5/26) 96% (25/26) 100% (2/2) 0% (0/25) \nStudy 1119  4 44 50% (22/44) 93% (41/44) 100% (10/10) 7% (3/44) \nStudy 1119 5 41 49% (20/41) 93% (38/41) 89% (8/9) 5% (2/40) \nStudy 0122 (ELECTRON-2) 6 25 0% (0/25) 96% (24/25) 100% (2/2) 4% (1/25) \na TE: number of treatment-experienced patients. \nb The denominator for relapse is the number of patients with HCV RNA < LLOQ at their last on-treatment assessment. \n \nTable 20: Response rates (SVR12) in patients with genotype 3 infection (ELECTRON-2) \n LDV/SOF+RBV \n\n12 weeks \nLDV/SOF \n12 weeks \n\n SVR Relapsea SVR Relapsea \nTreatment-na\u00efve 100% (26/26) 0% (0/26) 64% (16/25) 33% (8/24) \n\nPatients without cirrhosis 100% (20/20) 0% (0/21) 71% (15/21) 25% (5/20) \nPatients with cirrhosis 100% (6/6) 0% (0/5) 25% (1/4) 75% (3/4) \n\nTreatment-experienced 82% (41/50) 16% (8/49) NS NS \nPatients without cirrhosis 89% (25/28) 7% (2/27) NS NS \nPatients with cirrhosis 73% (16/22) 27% (6/22) NS NS \n\nNS: not studied. \na The denominator for relapse is the number of patients with HCV RNA < LLOQ at their last on-treatment assessment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nStudy 0154 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of \ntreatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in 18 genotype 1 HCV-infected patients with severe renal \nimpairment not requiring dialysis. At baseline, two patients had cirrhosis and the mean eGFR was \n24.9 mL/min (range: 9.0-39.6). SVR12 was achieved in 18/18 patients. \n \nStudy 4063 was an open-label three-arm clinical study that evaluated 8, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment \nwith ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in a total of 95 patients with genotype 1 (72%), 2 (22%), 4 (2%), 5 (1%), or \n6 (2%) CHC and ESRD requiring dialysis: 45 treatment-na\u00efve genotype 1 HCV-infected patients \nwithout cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 8 weeks; 31 treatment-experienced genotype 1 \nHCV-infected patients and treatment-na\u00efve or treatment-experienced patients with genotype 2, 5, and \n6 infection without cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks; and 19 genotype 1, 2, and 4 \nHCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks.  Of \nthe 95 total patients, at baseline, 20% of patients had cirrhosis, 22% were treatment experienced, 21% \nhad received a kidney transplant, 92% were on hemodialysis, and 8% were on peritoneal dialysis; \n\n\n\n71 \n\nmean duration on dialysis was 11.5 years (range: 0.2 to 43.0 years).  The SVR rates for the 8, 12, and \n24 week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment groups were 93% (42/45), 100% (31/31), and 79% (15/19), \nrespectively. Of the seven patients who did not achieve SVR12, none experienced virologic failure or \nrelapsed. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in HCV infected patients aged 3  years and above was evaluated \nin a Phase 2, open label clinical study that enrolled 226 patients, 221 patients with genotype 1, 2 \npatients with genotype 3, and 3 patients with genotype 4 CHC (Study 1116) (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).   \n \nPatients aged 12 to < 18 Years: \nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 100 patients aged 12 to < 18 years with genotype 1 \nHCV-infection. A total of 80 patients (n=80) were treatment-na\u00efve, while 20 patients (n=20) were \ntreatment-experienced. All patients were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. \n \nDemographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment-na\u00efve and \ntreatment-experienced patients. The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 63% of the patients \nwere female; 91% were White, 7% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 13% were Hispanic/Latino; mean \nweight was 61.3 kg (range: 33.0 to 126.0 kg); 55% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or \nequal to 800,000 IU/mL; 81% had genotype 1a HCV infection; and 1 patient who was treatment na\u00efve \nwas known to have cirrhosis. The majority of patients (84%) had been infected through vertical \ntransmission. \n \nThe SVR12 rate was 98% overall (98% [78/80] in treatment-na\u00efve patients and 100% [20/20] in \ntreatment experienced patients). A total of 2 out of 100 patients (2%), both treatment- na\u00efve, did not \nachieve SVR12 (due to loss to follow-up). No patient experienced virologic failure. \n \nPatients aged 6 to < 12 Years:  \nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 92 patients aged 6 to < 12 years with genotype 1, 3, or 4 \nHCV-infection. A total of 72 patients (78%) were treatment-na\u00efve and 20 patients (22%) were \ntreatment-experienced. Eighty-nine of the patients (87 patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and 2 \npatients with genotype 4 HCV infection) were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, 1 \ntreatment experienced patient with genotype 1 HCV infection and cirrhosis was treated with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, and 2 treatment experienced patients with genotype 3 HCV \ninfection were treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks. The median age was 9 \nyears (range: 6 to 11); 59% of the patients were male; 79% were White, 8% were Black, and 5% were \nAsian; 10% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was 32.8 kg (range: 17.5 to 76.4 kg); 59% had \nbaseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; 84% had genotype 1a HCV \ninfection; 2 patients (1 treatment-na\u00efve, 1 treatment-experienced) had known cirrhosis. The majority of \npatients (97%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  \n \nThe SVR rate was 99% overall (99% [88/89], 100% [1/1], and 100% [2/2] in patients treated with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus \nribavirin for 24 weeks, respectively). The one treatment-na\u00efve patient with genotype 1 HCV infection \nand cirrhosis who was treated with Harvoni for 12 weeks did not achieve SVR12 and relapsed.  \n \nPatients aged 3 to <6 Years:  \nLedipasvir/sofosbuvir was evaluated in 34 patients aged 3 to < 6 years with genotype 1 (n = 33) or \ngenotype 4 (n = 1) HCV-infection. All of the patients were treatment-na\u00efve and treated with \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The median age was 5 years (range: 3 to 5); 71% of the patients \nwere female; 79% were White, 3% were Black, and 6% were Asian; 18% were Hispanic/Latino; mean \nweight was 19.2 kg (range: 10.7 to 33.6 kg); 56% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal \n800,000 IU/mL; 82% had genotype 1a HCV infection; no patients had known cirrhosis. All patients \n(100%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nThe SVR rate was 97% overall (97% [32/33] in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and 100% \n[1/1] in patients with genotype 4 HCV infection). One patient who prematurely discontinued study \ntreatment after five days due to abnormal taste of the medication did not achieve SVR. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to HCV-infected patients, ledipasvir median \npeak plasma concentration was observed at 4.0 hours post-dose. Sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and \nthe median peak plasma concentrations were observed ~ 1 hour post-dose. Median peak plasma \nconcentration of GS-331007 was observed at 4 hours post-dose. \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, geometric mean \nsteady-state AUC0-24 for ledipasvir (n = 2,113), sofosbuvir (n = 1,542), and GS-331007 (n = 2,113) \nwere 7,290, 1,320 and 12,000 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively.  Steady-state Cmax for ledipasvir, sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007 were 323, 618 and 707 ng/mL, respectively. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 and Cmax \nwere similar in healthy adult subjects and patients with HCV infection.  Relative to healthy subjects \n(n = 191), ledipasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax were 24% lower and 32% lower, respectively, in HCV-infected \npatients. Ledipasvir AUC is dose proportional over the dose range of 3 to 100 mg.  Sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007 AUCs are near dose proportional over the dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg. \n \nEffects of food \nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with a \nmoderate fat or high fat meal increased the sofosbuvir AUC0-inf by approximately 2-fold, but did not \nsignificantly affect the sofosbuvir Cmax. The exposures to GS-331007 and ledipasvir were not altered \nin the presence of either meal type. Harvoni can be administered without regard to food. \n \nDistribution \n \nLedipasvir is > 99.8% bound to human plasma proteins.  After a single 90 mg dose of [14C]-ledipasvir \nin healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity ranged between 0.51 and 0.66. \n \nSofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent \nof drug concentration over the range of 1 \u00b5g/mL to 20 \u00b5g/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was \nminimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the \nblood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn vitro, no detectable metabolism of ledipasvir was observed by human CYP1A2, CYP2C8, \nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Evidence of slow oxidative metabolism via an unknown \nmechanism has been observed. Following a single dose of 90 mg [14C]-ledipasvir, systemic exposure \nwas almost exclusively due to the parent drug (> 98%). Unchanged ledipasvir is also the major species \npresent in faeces. \n \nSofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside \nanalogue triphosphate GS-461203. The active metabolite is not observed. The metabolic activation \npathway involves sequential hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A \nor carboxylesterase 1 and phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 \nfollowed by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation \nresults in the formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently \nrephosphorylated and lacks anti-HCV activity in vitro. Within ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, GS-331007 \naccounts for approximately 85% of total systemic exposure. \n \n\n\n\n73 \n\nElimination \n \nFollowing a single 90 mg oral dose of [14C]-ledipasvir, mean total recovery of the [14C]-radioactivity \nin faeces and urine was 87%, with most of the radioactive dose recovered from faeces (86%).  \nUnchanged ledipasvir excreted in faeces accounted for a mean of 70% of the administered dose and \nthe oxidative metabolite M19 accounted for 2.2% of the dose. These data suggest that biliary excretion \nof unchanged ledipasvir is a major route of elimination with renal excretion being a minor pathway \n(approximately 1%). The median terminal half-life of ledipasvir in healthy volunteers following \nadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in the fasted state was 47 hours. \n \nFollowing a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater \nthan 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, and expired \nair, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while \n3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. This data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination \npathway for GS-331007 with a large part actively secreted. The median terminal half-lives of \nsofosbuvir and GS-331007 following administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir were 0.5 and 27 hours, \nrespectively. \n \nNeither ledipasvir nor sofosbuvir are substrates for hepatic uptake transporters, organic cation \ntransporter (OCT) 1, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OATP1B3.  GS-331007 \nis not a substrate for renal transporters including organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or OAT3, or \nOCT2. \n \nIn vitro potential for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to affect other medicinal products \n \nAt concentrations achieved in the clinic, ledipasvir is not an inhibitor of hepatic transporters including \nthe OATP 1B1 or 1B3, BSEP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, multidrug and toxic compound extrusion \n(MATE) 1 transporter, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 2 or MRP4.  Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 \nare not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and \nGS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2 and MATE1. \n \nSofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP or uridine diphosphate \nglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzymes. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nRace and gender \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been identified for ledipasvir, \nsofosbuvir or GS-331007. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been \nidentified for sofosbuvir or GS-331007. AUC and Cmax of ledipasvir were 77% and 58% higher, \nrespectively, in females than males; however, the relationship between gender and ledipasvir \nexposures was not considered clinically relevant. \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients showed that within the age range (18 to \n80 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to ledipasvir, \nsofosbuvir or GS-331007. Clinical studies of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir included 235 patients (8.6% of total \nnumber of patients) aged 65 years and over. \n \nRenal impairment \nA summary of the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment (RI) on the exposures of the \ncomponents of Harvoni compared to subjects with normal renal function, as described in the text \nbelow, are provided in Table 21. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nTable 21: Effect of Varying Degrees of Renal Impairment on Exposures (AUC) of Sofosbuvir, GS-331007, \nand Ledipasvir Compared to Subjects with Normal Renal Function \n HCV-Negative Subjects HCV-Infected Subjects \n\nMild RI \n(eGFR \n\u226550 and \n<80 \nmL/min/1.\n73m2) \n\nModerate RI \n(eGFR \u226530 \nand <50 \nmL/min/1.73\nm2) \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR <30 \nmL/min/1.73\nm2) \n\nESRD Requiring \nDialysis \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n<30 \nmL/min/1.\n73m2) \n\nESRD \nRequiring \nDialysis Dosed 1 \n\nhr Before \nDialysis \n\nDosed 1 \nhr After \nDialysis \n\nSofosbuvir 1.6-fold\u2191 2.1-fold\u2191 2.7-fold\u2191 1.3-fold\u2191 1.6-fold\u2191 ~2-fold\u2191 1.9-fold\u2191 \nGS-331007 1.6-fold\u2191 1.9-fold\u2191 5.5-fold\u2191 \u226510-fold\u2191 \u226520-fold\u2191 ~6-fold\u2191 23-fold\u2191 \nLedipasvir - - \u2194 - - - 1.6-fold\u2191 \n\u2194 indicates no clinically relevant change in the exposure of Ledipasvir. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in \nHCV negative adult patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault, \nmedian [range] CrCl 22 [17-29] mL/min).   \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative adult patients with mild (eGFR \n\u2265 50 and < 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR \u2265 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal \nimpairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following \na single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir,relative to patients with normal renal function (eGFR \n> 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction \ncoefficient of approximately 53%. Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 hour \nhaemodialysis removed 18% of administered sofosbuvir dose. \n \nIn HCV-infected adult patients with severe renal impairment treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for \n12 weeks (n = 18), the pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were consistent \nwith that observed in HCV negative patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were studied in HCV-infected adult \npatients with ESRD requiring dialysis treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (n=94) for 8, 12, or 24 weeks, \nand compared to patients without renal impairment in the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir Phase 2/3 trials. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir were studied with a single dose of 90 mg ledipasvir in \nHCV negative adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (CPT class C).  Ledipasvir plasma \nexposure (AUCinf) was similar in patients with severe hepatic impairment and control patients with \nnormal hepatic function. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected adult patients \nindicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the \nexposure to ledipasvir. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in \nHCV-infected adult patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT class B and C).  \nRelative to patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher \nin moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and 9% higher, \nrespectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected patients indicated that cirrhosis \n(including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir \nand GS-331007. \n \nBody weight \nBody weight did not have a significant effect on sofosbuvir exposure according to a population \npharmacokinetic analysis. Exposure to ledipasvir decreases with increasing body weight but the effect \nis not considered to be clinically relevant. \n \n\n\n\n75 \n\nPaediatric population \nLedipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 exposures in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above were \nsimilar to those in adults from Phase 2/3 studies, following administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. \nThe 90% confidence intervals of geometric least-squares mean ratios for all PK parameters of interest \nwere contained within the predetermined similarity bounds of less than 2-fold (50% to 200%) with the \nexception of ledipasvir Ctau in paediatric patients 12 years and above which was 84% higher (90%CI: \n168% to 203%) and was not considered clinically relevant.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 have not been established in \npaediatric patients aged < 3 years (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nLedipasvir \n \nNo target organs of toxicity were identified in rat and dog studies with ledipasvir at AUC exposures \napproximately 7 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. \n \nLedipasvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nLedipasvir was not carcinogenic in the 26-week rasH2 transgenic mouse and the 2-year rat \ncarcinogenicity studies at exposures up to 26-times in mice and 8-times in rats higher than human \nexposure.  \n \nLedipasvir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility. In female rats, the mean number of corpora \nlutea and implantation sites were slightly reduced at maternal exposures 6-fold the exposure in humans \nat the recommended clinical dose. At the no observed effect level, AUC exposure to ledipasvir was \napproximately 7- and 3-fold, in males and females, respectively, the human exposure at the \nrecommended clinical dose. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were observed in rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies with ledipasvir. \n \nIn a rat pre- and postnatal study, at a maternally toxic dose, the developing rat offspring exhibited \nmean decreased body weight and body weight gain when exposed in utero (via maternal dosing) and \nduring lactation (via maternal milk) at a maternal exposure 4 times the exposure in humans at the \nrecommended clinical dose. There were no effects on survival, physical and behavioural development \nand reproductive performance in the offspring at maternal exposures similar to the exposure in humans \nat the recommended clinical dose. \n \nWhen administered to lactating rats, ledipasvir was detected in plasma of suckling rats likely due to \nexcretion of ledipasvir via milk. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA) \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that ledipasvir has the potential to be very \npersistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) in the environment (See section 6.6). \n \nSofosbuvir \n \nIn repeat dose toxicology studies in rat and dog, high doses of the 1:1 diastereomeric mixture caused \nadverse liver (dog) and heart (rat) effects and gastrointestinal reactions (dog). Exposure to sofosbuvir \nin rodent studies could not be detected likely due to high esterase activity; however, exposure to the \nmajor metabolite GS-331007 at doses which cause adverse effects was 16 times (rat) and 71 times \n(dog) higher than the clinical exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. No liver or heart findings were observed \nin chronic toxicity studies at exposures 5 times (rat) and 16 times (dog) higher than the clinical \n\n\n\n76 \n\nexposure. No liver or heart findings were observed in the 2-year carcinogenicity studies at exposures \n17 times (mouse) and 9 times (rat) higher than the clinical exposure. \n \nSofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies in mice and rats do not indicate any carcinogenicity potential of sofosbuvir \nadministered at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mouse and 750 mg/kg/day in rat. Exposure to \nGS-331007 in these studies was up to 17 times (mouse) and 9 times (rat) higher than the clinical \nexposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. \n \nSofosbuvir had no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility in rat and was not teratogenic in rat \nand rabbit development studies. No adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction or development of \noffspring in rat were reported. In rabbit studies exposure to sofosbuvir was 6 times the expected \nclinical exposure. In the rat studies, exposure to sofosbuvir could not be determined but exposure \nmargins based on the major human metabolite was approximately 5 times higher than the clinical \nexposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. \n \nSofosbuvir-derived material was transferred through the placenta in pregnant rats and into the milk of \nlactating rats. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nIf Harvoni has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet \nis applicable to your child (in this case please read \u201cyour child\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d). \n \n1. What Harvoni is and what it is used for \n \nHarvoni is a medicine that contains the active substances ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Harvoni is given \nto treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis C virus infection in adults and children 3  years of age and \nolder. \n \nHepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. The active substances in the medicine work together by \nblocking two different proteins that the virus needs to grow and reproduce itself, allowing the infection \nto be permanently eliminated from the body. \n \nHarvoni is sometimes taken with another medicine, ribavirin. \n \nIt is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with \nHarvoni. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Harvoni \n \nDo not take Harvoni \n\u2022 If you are allergic to ledipasvir, sofosbuvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6 of this leaflet). \n \n \n\n\n\n94 \n\n\u2022 If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); \n\u2022 carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and \n\nprevent seizures); \n\u2022 rosuvastatin (a medicine used to treat high cholesterol). \n\n \n\uf0e0 If any of these conditions apply to you, do not take Harvoni and tell your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nYour doctor will know if any of the following conditions apply to you. These will be considered \nbefore treatment with Harvoni is started. \n\u2022 other liver problems apart from hepatitis C, for instance \n\n\u2022 if you are awaiting a liver transplant; \n\u2022 if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your \n\ndoctor may want to monitor you more closely; \n\u2022 kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis, since Harvoni has not been fully tested in \n\npatients with severe kidney problems; \n\u2022 ongoing treatment for HIV infection, since your doctor may want to monitor you more \n\nclosely. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Harvoni if: \n\u2022 you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat \n\nirregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor \nmay consider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Harvoni is \nneeded, you may require additional heart monitoring. \n\n\u2022 you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or \nadjustment of your diabetes medication after starting Harvoni. Some diabetic patients have \nexperienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with \nmedicines like Harvoni. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months, any medicines \nfor heart problems and during treatment you experience: \n\u2022 slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; \n\u2022 shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; \n\u2022 chest-pain; \n\u2022 light-headedness \n\u2022 palpitations \n\u2022 near fainting or fainting \n \nBlood tests \nYour doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Harvoni. This is so that: \n\u2022 Your doctor can decide if you should take Harvoni and for how long; \n\u2022 Your doctor can confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C \n\nvirus. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age. The use of Harvoni in children under 3 \nyears of age has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Harvoni \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nWarfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists used to thin the blood. Your doctor \nmay need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \nYour liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other \nmedications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to \nclosely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Harvoni. \n \nIf you are not sure about taking any other medicines, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSome medicines should not be taken with Harvoni. \n \n\u2022 Do not take any other medicine that contains sofosbuvir, one of the active substances in \n\nHarvoni. \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines below: \n\n\u2022 amiodarone used to treat irregular heartbeats \n\u2022 tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, \n\nused to treat HIV infection \n\u2022 digoxin used to treat heart conditions \n\u2022 dabigatran used to thin the blood \n\u2022 statins used to treat high cholesterol \n\u2022 rifapentine (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis) \n\u2022 oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures) \n\u2022 tipranavir (used to treat HIV infection). \n\n \nTaking Harvoni with any of these may stop your medicines from working properly, or make any side \neffects worse. Your doctor may need to give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of medicine \nyou are taking. \n \n\u2022 Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines used to treat stomach ulcers, \n\nheartburn or acid reflux. This includes: \n\u2022 antacids (such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate). These should \n\nbe taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after Harvoni; \n\u2022 proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and \n\nesomeprazole). These should be taken at the same time as Harvoni. Do not take proton \npump inhibitors before Harvoni. Your doctor may give you a different medicine or adjust \nthe dose of the medicine you are taking; \n\n\u2022 H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine). Your \ndoctor may give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of the medicine you are \ntaking. \n\nThese medicines can decrease the amount of ledipasvir in your blood. If you are taking one of these \nmedicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid \nreflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine. \n \nPregnancy and contraception \nThe effects of Harvoni during pregnancy are not known. If you are pregnant, think you may be \npregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy must be avoided if Harvoni is taken together with ribavirin. It is very important that you \nread the \"Pregnancy\" section in the ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. Ribavirin can be very \ndamaging to an unborn baby. Therefore, special precautions in sexual activity must be taken if there is \nany chance for pregnancy to occur. \n \n\u2022 You or your partner must use an effective birth control method during treatment with Harvoni \n\ntogether with ribavirin and for some time afterwards. It is very important that you read the \n\u201cPregnancy\u201d section in the ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. Ask your doctor for an \neffective contraceptive method suitable for you. \n\n\n\n96 \n\n\u2022 If you or your partner become pregnant during Harvoni and ribavirin treatment or in the months \nthat follow, you must contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Harvoni. It is not known whether ledipasvir or \nsofosbuvir, the two active substances of Harvoni, pass into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel tired after taking Harvoni you should not take part in activities that require concentration, \nfor example, do not drive, ride a bike or operate machines. \n \nHarvoni 90 mg/400 mg and 45 mg/200 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose \n\u2022 If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact \n\nyour doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \nHarvoni 90 mg/400 mg film-coated tablets contains sunset yellow FCF (E110) which can cause \nallergic reactions  \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sunset yellow FCF, also called \u201cE110\u201d before taking \n\nthis medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Harvoni \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nRecommended dose \nHarvoni is to be taken as advised by your doctor. The recommended dose of Harvoni in adults is \none 90 mg/400 mg film-coated tablet once a day. Your doctor will tell you for how many weeks you \nshould take Harvoni. \n \nThe recommended dose of Harvoni in children aged 3 years and above is based on weight. Take \nHarvoni as advised by your doctor.  \n \nSwallow the tablet(s) whole with or without food. Do not chew, crush or split the tablet as it has a very \nbitter taste. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have problems swallowing tablets. \n \nIf you are taking an antacid, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after Harvoni. \n \nIf you are taking a proton pump inhibitor, take the proton pump inhibitor at the same time as \nHarvoni. Do not take it before Harvoni. \n \nIf you are sick (vomit) after taking Harvoni it may affect the amount of Harvoni in your blood. This \nmay make Harvoni work less well. \n\u2022 If you are sick (vomit) less than 5 hours after taking Harvoni, take another dose. \n\u2022 If you are sick (vomit) more than 5 hours after taking Harvoni, you do not need to take \n\nanother dose until your next scheduled dose. \n \nIf you take more Harvoni than you should \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose you should contact your doctor or nearest \nemergency department immediately for advice. Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily \ndescribe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Harvoni \nIt is important not to miss a dose of this medicine. \n \nIf you do miss a dose, work out how long it is since you last took your Harvoni: \n\n\n\n97 \n\n\u2022 If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Harvoni, you must take the dose as \nsoon as possible. Then take the next dose at your usual time. \n\n\u2022 If it\u2019s 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Harvoni, wait and take the next dose at \nyour usual time. Do not take a double dose (two doses close together). \n\n \nDo not stop taking Harvoni \nDo not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nIf Harvoni has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet \nis applicable to your child (in this case please read \u201cyour child\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d). \n \n \n1. What Harvoni is and what it is used for \n \nHarvoni granules are a medicine that contain the active substances ledipasvir and sofosbuvir which are \ngiven in a granule formulation. Harvoni is given to treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis C virus infection \nin adults and children 3 years of age and older. \n \nHepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. The active substances in the medicine work together by \nblocking two different proteins that the virus needs to grow and reproduce itself, allowing the infection \nto be permanently eliminated from the body. \n \nHarvoni is sometimes taken with another medicine, ribavirin. \n \nIt is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with \nHarvoni. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Harvoni \n \nDo not take Harvoni \n\u2022 If you are allergic to ledipasvir, sofosbuvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6 of this leaflet). \n \n\n \n\n\n\n101 \n\n\u2022 If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); \n\u2022 carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and prevent \n\nseizures); \n\u2022 rosuvastatin (a medicine used to treat high cholesterol). \n \n\n\uf0e0 If any of these conditions apply to you, do not take Harvoni and tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nYour doctor will know if any of the following conditions apply to you.  These will be considered \nbefore treatment with Harvoni is started. \n\u2022 other liver problems apart from hepatitis C, for instance \n\n\u2022 if you are awaiting a liver transplant; \n\u2022 if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor \n\nmay want to monitor you more closely; \n\u2022 kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis, since Harvoni has not been fully tested in \n\npatients with severe kidney problems; \n\u2022 ongoing treatment for HIV infection, since your doctor may want to monitor you more \n\nclosely. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Harvoni if: \n\u2022 you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat \n\nirregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor \nmay consider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Harvoni is \nneeded, you may require additional heart monitoring. \n\n\u2022 you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or \nadjustment of your diabetes medication after starting Harvoni. Some diabetic patients have \nexperienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines \nlike Harvoni. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months, any medicines \nfor heart problems and during treatment you experience: \n\u2022 slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; \n\u2022 shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; \n\u2022 chest-pain; \n\u2022 light-headedness \n\u2022 palpitations \n\u2022 near fainting or fainting \n \nBlood tests \nYour doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Harvoni. This is so that: \n\u2022 Your doctor can decide if you should take Harvoni and for how long \n\u2022 Your doctor can confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C \n\nvirus. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age. The use of Harvoni in children under 3 \nyears of age has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Harvoni \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.   \n \nWarfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists used to thin the blood. Your doctor \nmay need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \nYour liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other \nmedications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to \nclosely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Harvoni. \n \nIf you are not sure about taking any other medicines, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSome medicines should not be taken with Harvoni. \n \n\u2022 Do not take any other medicine that contains sofosbuvir, one of the active substances in \n\nHarvoni. \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines below: \n\n\u2022 amiodarone used to treat irregular heartbeats \n\u2022 tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, \nused to treat HIV infection \n\u2022 digoxin used to treat heart conditions \n\u2022 dabigatran used to thin the blood \n\u2022 statins used to treat high cholesterol \n\u2022 rifapentine (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis) \n\u2022 oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures) \n\u2022 tipranavir (used to treat HIV infection). \n \n\nTaking Harvoni with any of these may stop your medicines from working properly, or make any side \neffects worse. Your doctor may need to give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of medicine \nyou are taking. \n \n\u2022 Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines used to treat stomach ulcers, \n\nheartburn or acid reflux. This includes: \n\u2022 antacids (such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate). These should be \n\ntaken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after Harvoni; \n\u2022 proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and \n\nesomeprazole). These should be taken at the same time as Harvoni. Do not take proton \npump inhibitors before Harvoni. Your doctor may give you a different medicine or adjust \nthe dose of the medicine you are taking; \n\n\u2022 H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine). Your doctor \nmay give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of the medicine you are taking. \n\nThese medicines can decrease the amount of ledipasvir in your blood.  If you are taking one of these \nmedicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid \nreflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine. \n \nPregnancy and contraception \nThe effects of Harvoni during pregnancy are not known. If you are pregnant, think you may be \npregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy must be avoided if Harvoni is taken together with ribavirin. It is very important that you \nread the \"Pregnancy\" section in the ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. Ribavirin can be very \ndamaging to an unborn baby. Therefore, special precautions in sexual activity must be taken if there is \nany chance for pregnancy to occur. \n \n\n\n\n103 \n\n\u2022 You or your partner must use an effective birth control method during treatment with Harvoni \ntogether with ribavirin and for some time afterwards. It is very important that you read the \n\u201cPregnancy\u201d section in the ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. Ask your doctor for an \neffective contraceptive method suitable for you. \n\n\u2022 If you or your partner become pregnant during Harvoni and ribavirin treatment or in the months \nthat follow, you must contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Harvoni. It is not known whether ledipasvir or \nsofosbuvir, the two active substances of Harvoni, pass into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you feel tired after taking Harvoni you should not take part in activities that require concentration, \nfor example, do not drive, ride a bike or operate machines. \n \nHarvoni granules contain lactose \n\n\u2022 If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, \ncontact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n\n \n \n3.

how to take harvoni", "Section_Content": "always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. recommended dose harvoni is to be taken as advised by your doctor. the recommended dose of harvoni in adults is one 90 mg/400 mg film-coated tablet once a day. your doctor will tell you for how many weeks you should take harvoni. the recommended dose of harvoni in children aged 3 years and above is based on weight. take harvoni as advised by your doctor. swallow the tablet(s) whole with or without food. do not chew, crush or split the tablet as it has a very bitter taste. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have problems swallowing tablets. if you are taking an antacid, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after harvoni. if you are taking a proton pump inhibitor, take the proton pump inhibitor at the same time as harvoni. do not take it before harvoni. if you are sick (vomit) after taking harvoni it may affect the amount of harvoni in your blood. this may make harvoni work less well. if you are sick (vomit) less than 5 hours after taking harvoni, take another dose. if you are sick (vomit) more than 5 hours after taking harvoni, you do not need to take another dose until your next scheduled dose. if you take more harvoni than you should if you accidentally take more than the recommended dose you should contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. if you forget to take harvoni it is important not to miss a dose of this medicine. if you do miss a dose, work out how long it is since you last took your harvoni: 97 if you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take harvoni, you must take the dose as soon as possible. then take the next dose at your usual time. if it's 18 hours or more after the time you usually take harvoni, wait and take the next dose at your usual time. do not take a double dose (two doses close together). do not stop taking harvoni do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to. it is very important that you complete the full course of treatment to give the medicine the best chance to treat your hepatitis c virus infection. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "harvoni", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 12, "EndOffset": 25},
