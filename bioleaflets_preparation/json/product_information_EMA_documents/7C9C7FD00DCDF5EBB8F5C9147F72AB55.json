This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n\n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \n\nInhixa 2,000 IU (20 mg)/0.2 mL solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\n10,000 IU/mL (100 mg/mL) solution for injection \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU anti-Xa activity (equivalent to 20 mg) in \n\n0.2 mL water for injections. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a biological substance obtained by alkaline depolymerization of heparin benzyl ester \n\nderived from porcine intestinal mucosa. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n\nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in particular \nthose undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility at \n\nincreased risk of venous thromboembolism.  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to require \nthrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), in \n\ncombination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to be \nmanaged medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk surgery.  \n\nIn moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of 7-\n\n10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the patient no \n\nlonger has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by SC injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there is a need for \n\nearlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high risk patient \n\nwaiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no later than \n\n12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis \nup to 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal \nor pelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by SC injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. \n\nmobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered SC either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) or as \n\ntwice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by SC injection administered in combination with antiplatelet \n\ntherapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until clinical \n\nstabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral loading \n\ndose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of 75–325 mg/day \n\nlong-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous (IV) \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nadministered SC every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the first two SC doses). \n\nAppropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) should be \n\nadministered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The recommended duration of treatment is 8 days or \n\nuntil hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic \n\n(fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin sodium should be given between 15 minutes before \n\nand 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last dose of enoxaparin sodium SC was given less than \n\n8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last SC administration \n\nwas given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nenoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥75 years of age, an initial IV bolus must not be used. \n\nInitiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU (75 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two SC doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC dosing for the remaining doses). For dosage \n\nin elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\n Severe renal impairment  \nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\n \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease  \n\n \n\n2,000 IU (20 mg) SC once daily \n\nTreatment of  DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC and then 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC every 24 hours \n\n \n\nNo IV initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC every 24 hours \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\n Moderate and mild renal impairment \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-\n\n50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring is \n\nadvised. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by SC injection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a \nSC injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe pre-filled disposable syringe is ready for immediate use.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using ampoules or multiple-dose vials to \n\nassure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\n SC injection technique: \nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep SC injection.  \n\n \n\nDo not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when using pre-\n\nfilled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the patient’s body \n\nweight, use the graduated pre-filled syringes to reach the required volume by discarding the excess before \n\ninjection. Please be aware that in some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the graduations \n\non the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. Do not rub the \n\ninjection site after administration. \n\n \n\nNote for the pre-filled syringes fitted with an automatic safety system: The safety system is triggered at the \n\nend of the injection (see instructions in section 6.6). \n\n \n\nIn case of self-administration, patient should be advised to follow instructions provided in the patient \n\ninformation leaflet included in the pack of this medicine. \n\n \n\n IV (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only): \nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a SC \n\ninjection.  \n\nFor IV injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an IV line. It should not be mixed or co-administered \n\nwith other medications. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other drugs, the IV access \n\nchosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the IV \n\nbolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to clear the port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely \n\nadministered with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water. \n\n \n\no Initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the IV line. \n\n \n\no Additional bolus for PCI when last SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be administered if \n\nlast SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% \n\ndextrose in water) as follows:  \n\nWithdraw 30 mL from the infusion bag with a syringe and discard the liquid. Inject the complete contents of \n\nthe 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe into the 20 mL remaining in the bag. Gently mix \n\nthe contents of the bag. Withdraw the required volume of diluted solution with a syringe for administration \n\ninto the IV line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below. It is recommended to prepare \n\nthe dilution immediately before use. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nVolume to be injected through IV line after dilution is completed at a concentration of 300 IU (3 mg) /mL. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\n \n\nRequired dose \n\n 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nVolume to inject when \n\ndiluted to a final \n\nconcentration of  \n\n 300 IU (3 mg) / mL \n\n \n\n[kg] \n\n \n\nIU \n\n \n\n[mg] \n\n \n\n[mL] \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n1350 \n\n \n\n13.5 \n\n \n\n4.5 \n\n50 1500 15 5 \n\n55 1650 16.5 5.5 \n\n60 1800 18 6 \n\n65 1950 19.5 6.5 \n\n70 2100 21 7 \n\n75 2250 22.5 7.5 \n\n80 2400 24 8 \n\n85 2550 25.5 8.5 \n\n90 2700 27 9 \n\n95 2850 28.5 9.5 \n\n100 3000 30 10 \n\n105 3150 31.5 10.5 \n\n110 3300 33 11 \n\n115 3450 34.5 11.5 \n\n120 3600 36 12 \n\n125 3750 37.5 12.5 \n\n130 3900 39 13 \n\n135 4050 40.5 13.5 \n\n140 4200 42 14 \n\n145 4350 43.5 14.5 \n\n150 4500 45 15 \n\n  \n\n \n\n Arterial line injection: \nIt is administered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit for the prevention of thrombus formation in the \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \nClinical monitoring and laboratory tests [prothrombin time expressed as the International Normalized \n\nRatio (INR)] must be intensified to monitor the effect of VKA. \n\nAs there is an interval before the VKA reaches its maximum effect, enoxaparin sodium therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a constant dose for as long as necessary in order to maintain the INR within the desired \n\ntherapeutic range for the indication in two successive tests. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a VKA, the VKA should be discontinued and the first dose of enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given when the INR has dropped below the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) \nFor patients currently receiving enoxaparin sodium, discontinue enoxaparin sodium and start the DOAC 0 to \n\n2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of enoxaparin sodium would be due as per \n\nDOAC label. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a DOAC, the first dose of enoxaparin sodium should be given at the time the \n\nnext DOAC dose would be taken. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nAdministration in spinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture  \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, careful neurological monitoring is recommended due to the risk of \n\nneuraxial haematomas (see section 4.4).  \n\n- At doses used for prophylaxis \nA puncture-free interval of at least 12 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at prophylactic doses and the needle or catheter placement. \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of at least 12 hours should be observed before removing \n\nthe catheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 24 hours. \n\nThe 2 hours preoperative initiation of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) is not compatible with \n\nneuraxial anaesthesia. \n\n- At doses used for treatment \nA puncture-free interval of at least 24 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at curative doses and the needle or catheter placement (see also section 4.3).  \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of 24 hours should be observed before removing the \n\ncatheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 48 hours. \n\nPatients receiving the twice daily doses (i.e. 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) twice daily or 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice-daily) should omit the second enoxaparin sodium dose to allow a sufficient delay \n\nbefore catheter placement or removal.  \n\nAnti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial \n\nhematoma will be avoided.  \n\nLikewise, consider not using enoxaparin sodium until at least 4 hours after the spinal/epidural puncture or \n\nafter the catheter has been removed. The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\n General \nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\n History of HIT (>100 days) \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (>100 days) of heparin-\n\ninduced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such a \n\ncase must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments \n\nare considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \n\n Monitoring of platelet counts \nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n\n \n\n Haemorrhage \nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medications affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n Laboratory tests \nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\n Spinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach a \n\nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance [15--\n\n30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is more \n\nprolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\n Skin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\n Percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last IV/SC enoxaparin sodium injection. If the treatment with \n\nenoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours \n\nafter sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma \n\nformation. \n\n \n\n Acute infective endocarditis \nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after a \n\ncareful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\n Mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\n Pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg ) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Elderly \nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\n Renal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which increases the \n\nrisk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological monitoring by anti-\n\nXa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\n Hepatic impairment \nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Low weight \nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (<45 kg) and low-weight men (<57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Obese Patients \nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Hyperkalaemia \nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\n Traceability \nLMWHs are biological medicinal products. In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n  \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended:  \n\n Medicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution: \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\n Other medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n\n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n \n\n Medicinal products increasing potassium levels: \nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely. Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis \n\nfollowing surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment of DVT \n\nwith or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC \n\ndose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) SC dose once a day. In the clinical studies for treatment of \n\nunstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours, \n\nand in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI enoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) \n\nIV bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see section 4.4 and 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ \n\n1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\n Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \n\n Rare: Eosinophilia* \n\n Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Common: Allergic reaction \n\n Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees of \nneurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of normality) \n\n Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury *  \n\n Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema  \n\n Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \n\n Rare: Alopecia* \n\n Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena have \nbeen usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\nInjection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \n\nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\n Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\n Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\n Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medications affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSystem \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\n \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n  \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and \n\ngastro-intestinal haemorrhage. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\n \n\nSyste\n\nm \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymph\n\natic \n\nsystem \n\ndisord\n\ners \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n \n\nVery common:    \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns \nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nCommon:  \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nVery rare:     \n\nImmuno-\n\nallergic \n\nthrombocytope\n\nnia \nβ\n: Platelet increased >400 G/L  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\nAccidental overdose with enoxaparin sodium after IV, extracorporeal or SC administration may lead to \n\nhaemorrhagic complications. Following oral administration of even large doses, it is unlikely that enoxaparin \n\nsodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow IV injection of protamine. The dose of \n\nprotamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the anticoagulant \n\neffect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the previous \n\n8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be administered if \n\nenoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine administration, or if it \n\nhas been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the enoxaparin sodium \n\ninjection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses of protamine, the \n\nanti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about 60%) (see the \n\nprescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\n Extended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, 179 \n\npatients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) SC, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) (n=90) once a day SC or to placebo (n=89) for 3 weeks. The incidence of DVT during extended \n\nprophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo, no PE was reported. No \n\nmajor bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nAll Treated Extended Prophylaxis \n\nPatients \n90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)*  18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n# \n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo =0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo =0.537 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC were randomized to a \n\npost-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=131) once a day SC or to placebo \n\n(n=131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during extended prophylaxis was \n\nsignificantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE (enoxaparin sodium 21 \n\n[16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p=0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium 8 [6.1%] versus placebo \n\n28 [21.4%]; p=<0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the enoxaparin sodium and the \n\nplacebo group. \n\n \n\n Extended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \nA double-blind, multicenter trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) SC) daily for 6 to 10 days and were \n\nthen randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. Bilateral \n\nvenography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous thromboembolism \n\noccurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for four weeks after \n\nsurgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of venographically demonstrated \n\nthrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. The rates of venous \n\nthromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n=20) in the placebo group and 4.8% \n\n(n=8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p=0.02. This difference persisted at three months [13.8% vs. 5.5% \n\n(n=23 vs 9), p=0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other complications during the \n\ndouble-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicenter, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day SC was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients with \n\nseverely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of <10 meters for ≤3 days). \n\nThis study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated. Treatment continued for \n\n6 to 14 days (median duration 7 days).

A total \n\nof 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. All patients also received warfarin \n\nsodium (dose adjusted according to prothrombin time to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within \n\n72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the \n\ntargeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved.

Patients had to be treated in hospital for a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of \n\n8 days, until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures or hospital discharge. The patients had to be \n\nfollowed up to 30 days. In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the combined \n\nincidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a decrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk \n\nreduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined incidence was maintained after 30 days (from \n\n23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the SC \n\ninjection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicenter study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by an SC injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours or IV unfractionated \n\nheparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were also treated with  acetylsalicylic acid for a \n\nminimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was adjusted for severe renally impaired \n\npatients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The SC injections of enoxaparin sodium were given \n\nuntil hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days (whichever came first). \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last SC \n\nadministration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, IV bolus of 30 IU/ kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin \n\nsodium, if the last SC administration given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p<0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p<0.001). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p=0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage (a \n\nmeasure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group (10.1%) \n\nas compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of treatment \n\nwith enoxaparin sodium. \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated SC administration and after single IV administration. The quantitative determination of anti-Xa \n\nand anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic methods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after SC injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is close to \n\n100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after SC injection and achieves \n\napproximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single SC administration of 2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, \n\n100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours provided \n\ninitial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 88% of \n\nsteady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated SC administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily \n\nregimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about \n\n15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated SC administration of the 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nregimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single \n\ndose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated SC administration no accumulation takes \n\nplace. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after SC administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa activity. The \n\nmean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following SC injection and \n\nreaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nand 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour IV infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single SC dose to about 7 hours \n\nafter repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal.  However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n\n<30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) IV dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated SC 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is marginally \n\nhigher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese control \n\nsubjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-adjusted \n\nclearance in obese subjects with SC dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-SC 4,000 IU (40 mg) dose, \n\nthat anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men \n\n(<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week SC toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at  10 mg/kg/day in the 26-week \n\nSC and IV toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at SC doses of enoxaparin sodium up to 30 mg/kg/day did not \n\nreveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was found to have no effect \n\non fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at SC doses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Do not \n\ntry to inject yourself if you have not been trained how to do so. If you are not sure what to do, talk to your \n\ndoctor or nurse immediately. \n\n \n\nBefore injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n- Check the expiry date on the medicine. Do not use if the date has passed. \n\n- Check the syringe is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear solution. If not, use another \n\nsyringe. \n\n- Do not use this medicine if you notice any change in the appearance of the product. \n\n- Make sure you know how much you are going to inject. \n\n- Check your abdomen to see if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin colour, swelling, \n\noozing or is still painful, if so talk to your doctor or nurse. \n\n- Decide where you are going to inject the medicine. Change the place where you inject each time \n\nfrom the right to the left side of your stomach. This medicine should be injected just under the skin \n\non your stomach, but not too near the belly button or any scar tissue (at least 5 cm away from these). \n\n- The pre-filled syringe is intended for single use only. \n\n \n\nInstructions on injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n1)  Wash your hands and the area that you will inject with soap and water. Dry them. \n\n2)  Sit or lie in a comfortable position so you are relaxed. Make sure you can see the place you are going \n\nto inject. A lounge chair, recliner, or bed propped up with pillows is ideal. \n\n3)  Choose an area on the right or left side of your stomach. This should be at least 5 cm away from \n\nyour belly button and out towards your sides. \n\n \n\nRemember: Do not inject yourself within 5 cm of your belly button or around existing scars or bruises. \n\nChange the place where you inject between the left and right sides of your stomach, depending on the area \n\nyou were last injected. \n\n \n\n4)  Carefully pull off the needle cap from the syringe. Throw away the cap. The syringe is pre-filled and \n\nready to use. \n\n \nDo not press on the plunger before injecting yourself to get rid of air bubbles. This can lead to a loss of the \n\nmedicine. Once you have removed the cap, do not allow the needle to touch anything. This is to make sure \n\nthe needle stays clean (sterile). \n\n \n\n5)  Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, gently pinch the \n\ncleaned area of your abdomen between your forefinger and thumb to make a fold in the skin \n\n \n\nMake sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n\n \n\n6)  Hold the syringe so that the needle is pointing downwards (vertically at a 90º angle). Insert the full \n\nlength of the needle into the skin fold \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n7)  Press down on the plunger with your finger.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\n10,000 IU/mL (100 mg/mL) solution for injection \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU anti-Xa activity (equivalent to 40 mg) in \n\n0.4 mL water for injections. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a biological substance obtained by alkaline depolymerization of heparin benzyl ester \n\nderived from porcine intestinal mucosa. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n\nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in particular \nthose undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility at \n\nincreased risk of venous thromboembolism.  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to require \nthrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), in \n\ncombination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to be \nmanaged medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk surgery.  \n\nIn moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of 7-\n\n10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the patient no \n\nlonger has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by SC injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there is a need for \n\nearlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high risk patient \n\nwaiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no later than \n\n12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis \nup to 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal \nor pelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by SC injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. \n\nmobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered SC either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) or as \n\ntwice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by SC injection administered in combination with antiplatelet \n\ntherapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until clinical \n\nstabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral loading \n\ndose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of 75–325 mg/day \n\nlong-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous (IV) \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nadministered SC every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the first two SC doses). \n\nAppropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) should be \n\nadministered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The recommended duration of treatment is 8 days or \n\nuntil hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic \n\n(fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin sodium should be given between 15 minutes before \n\nand 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last dose of enoxaparin sodium SC was given less than \n\n8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last SC administration \n\nwas given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nenoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥75 years of age, an initial IV bolus must not be used. \n\nInitiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU (75 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two SC doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC dosing for the remaining doses). For dosage \n\nin elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\n Severe renal impairment  \nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\n \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease  \n\n \n\n2,000 IU (20 mg) SC once daily \n\nTreatment of  DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC and then 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC every 24 hours \n\n \n\nNo IV initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC every 24 hours \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\n Moderate and mild renal impairment \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-\n\n50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring is \n\nadvised. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by SC injection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a \nSC injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe pre-filled disposable syringe is ready for immediate use.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using ampoules or multiple-dose vials to \n\nassure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\n SC injection technique: \nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep SC injection.  \n\n \n\nDo not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when using pre-\n\nfilled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the patient’s body \n\nweight, use the graduated pre-filled syringes to reach the required volume by discarding the excess before \n\ninjection. Please be aware that in some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the graduations \n\non the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. Do not rub the \n\ninjection site after administration. \n\n \n\nNote for the pre-filled syringes fitted with an automatic safety system: The safety system is triggered at the \n\nend of the injection (see instructions in section 6.6). \n\n \n\nIn case of self-administration, patient should be advised to follow instructions provided in the patient \n\ninformation leaflet included in the pack of this medicine. \n\n \n\n IV (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only): \nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a SC \n\ninjection.  \n\nFor IV injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an IV line. It should not be mixed or co-administered \n\nwith other medications. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other drugs, the IV access \n\nchosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the IV \n\nbolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to clear the port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely \n\nadministered with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water. \n\n \n\no Initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the IV line. \n\n \n\no Additional bolus for PCI when last SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be administered if \n\nlast SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% \n\ndextrose in water) as follows:  \n\nWithdraw 30 mL from the infusion bag with a syringe and discard the liquid. Inject the complete contents of \n\nthe 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe into the 20 mL remaining in the bag. Gently mix \n\nthe contents of the bag. Withdraw the required volume of diluted solution with a syringe for administration \n\ninto the IV line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below. It is recommended to prepare \n\nthe dilution immediately before use. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nVolume to be injected through IV line after dilution is completed at a concentration of 300 IU (3 mg) /mL. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\n \n\nRequired dose \n\n 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nVolume to inject when \n\ndiluted to a final \n\nconcentration of  \n\n 300 IU (3 mg) / mL \n\n \n\n[kg] \n\n \n\nIU \n\n \n\n[mg] \n\n \n\n[mL] \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n1350 \n\n \n\n13.5 \n\n \n\n4.5 \n\n50 1500 15 5 \n\n55 1650 16.5 5.5 \n\n60 1800 18 6 \n\n65 1950 19.5 6.5 \n\n70 2100 21 7 \n\n75 2250 22.5 7.5 \n\n80 2400 24 8 \n\n85 2550 25.5 8.5 \n\n90 2700 27 9 \n\n95 2850 28.5 9.5 \n\n100 3000 30 10 \n\n105 3150 31.5 10.5 \n\n110 3300 33 11 \n\n115 3450 34.5 11.5 \n\n120 3600 36 12 \n\n125 3750 37.5 12.5 \n\n130 3900 39 13 \n\n135 4050 40.5 13.5 \n\n140 4200 42 14 \n\n145 4350 43.5 14.5 \n\n150 4500 45 15 \n\n  \n\n \n\n Arterial line injection: \nIt is administered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit for the prevention of thrombus formation in the \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \nClinical monitoring and laboratory tests [prothrombin time expressed as the International Normalized \n\nRatio (INR)] must be intensified to monitor the effect of VKA. \n\nAs there is an interval before the VKA reaches its maximum effect, enoxaparin sodium therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a constant dose for as long as necessary in order to maintain the INR within the desired \n\ntherapeutic range for the indication in two successive tests. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a VKA, the VKA should be discontinued and the first dose of enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given when the INR has dropped below the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) \nFor patients currently receiving enoxaparin sodium, discontinue enoxaparin sodium and start the DOAC 0 to \n\n2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of enoxaparin sodium would be due as per \n\nDOAC label. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a DOAC, the first dose of enoxaparin sodium should be given at the time the \n\nnext DOAC dose would be taken. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\nAdministration in spinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture  \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, careful neurological monitoring is recommended due to the risk of \n\nneuraxial haematomas (see section 4.4).  \n\n- At doses used for prophylaxis \nA puncture-free interval of at least 12 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at prophylactic doses and the needle or catheter placement. \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of at least 12 hours should be observed before removing \n\nthe catheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 24 hours. \n\nThe 2 hours preoperative initiation of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) is not compatible with \n\nneuraxial anaesthesia. \n\n- At doses used for treatment \nA puncture-free interval of at least 24 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at curative doses and the needle or catheter placement (see also section 4.3).  \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of 24 hours should be observed before removing the \n\ncatheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 48 hours. \n\nPatients receiving the twice daily doses (i.e. 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) twice daily or 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice-daily) should omit the second enoxaparin sodium dose to allow a sufficient delay \n\nbefore catheter placement or removal.  \n\nAnti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial \n\nhematoma will be avoided.  \n\nLikewise, consider not using enoxaparin sodium until at least 4 hours after the spinal/epidural puncture or \n\nafter the catheter has been removed. The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\n General \nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\n History of HIT (>100 days) \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (>100 days) of heparin-\n\ninduced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such a \n\ncase must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments \n\nare considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \n\n Monitoring of platelet counts \nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n\n \n\n Haemorrhage \nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medications affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n Laboratory tests \nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\n Spinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach a \n\nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance [15--\n\n30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is more \n\nprolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\n Skin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\n Percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last IV/SC enoxaparin sodium injection. If the treatment with \n\nenoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours \n\nafter sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma \n\nformation. \n\n \n\n Acute infective endocarditis \nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after a \n\ncareful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\n Mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\n Pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg ) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Elderly \nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\n Renal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which increases the \n\nrisk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological monitoring by anti-\n\nXa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\n Hepatic impairment \nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Low weight \nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (<45 kg) and low-weight men (<57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Obese Patients \nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Hyperkalaemia \nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\n Traceability \nLMWHs are biological medicinal products. In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended:  \n\n Medicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution: \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\n Other medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n\n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n \n\n Medicinal products increasing potassium levels: \nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely.  Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis \n\nfollowing surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment of DVT \n\nwith or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC \n\ndose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) SC dose once a day. In the clinical studies for treatment of \n\nunstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours, \n\nand in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI enoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) \n\nIV bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see section 4.4 and 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ \n\n1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\n Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \n\n Rare: Eosinophilia* \n\n Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Common: Allergic reaction \n\n Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees of \nneurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of normality) \n\n Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury *  \n\n Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema  \n\n Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \n\n Rare: Alopecia* \n\n Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena have \nbeen usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\nInjection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \n\nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\n Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\n Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\n Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medications affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSystem \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\n \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n  \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and \n\ngastro-intestinal haemorrhage. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\n \n\nSyste\n\nm \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymph\n\natic \n\nsystem \n\ndisord\n\ners \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n \n\nVery common:    \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns \nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nCommon:  \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nVery rare:     \n\nImmuno-\n\nallergic \n\nthrombocytope\n\nnia \nβ\n: Platelet increased >400 G/L  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\nAccidental overdose with enoxaparin sodium after IV, extracorporeal or SC administration may lead to \n\nhaemorrhagic complications. Following oral administration of even large doses, it is unlikely that enoxaparin \n\nsodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow IV injection of protamine. The dose of \n\nprotamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the anticoagulant \n\neffect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the previous \n\n8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be administered if \n\nenoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine administration, or if it \n\nhas been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the enoxaparin sodium \n\ninjection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses of protamine, the \n\nanti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about 60%) (see the \n\nprescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\n Extended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, 179 \n\npatients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) SC, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) (n=90) once a day SC or to placebo (n=89) for 3 weeks. The incidence of DVT during extended \n\nprophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo, no PE was reported. No \n\nmajor bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nAll Treated Extended Prophylaxis \n\nPatients \n90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)*  18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n# \n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo =0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo =0.537 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC were randomized to a \n\npost-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=131) once a day SC or to placebo \n\n(n=131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during extended prophylaxis was \n\nsignificantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE (enoxaparin sodium 21 \n\n[16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p=0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium 8 [6.1%] versus placebo \n\n28 [21.4%]; p=<0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the enoxaparin sodium and the \n\nplacebo group. \n\n \n\n Extended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \nA double-blind, multicenter trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) SC) daily for 6 to 10 days and were \n\nthen randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. Bilateral \n\nvenography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous thromboembolism \n\noccurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for four weeks after \n\nsurgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of venographically demonstrated \n\nthrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. The rates of venous \n\nthromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n=20) in the placebo group and 4.8% \n\n(n=8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p=0.02. This difference persisted at three months [13.8% vs. 5.5% \n\n(n=23 vs 9), p=0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other complications during the \n\ndouble-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicenter, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day SC was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients with \n\nseverely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of <10 meters for ≤3 days). \n\nThis study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated. Treatment continued for \n\n6 to 14 days (median duration 7 days).

A total \n\nof 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. All patients also received warfarin \n\nsodium (dose adjusted according to prothrombin time to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within \n\n72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the \n\ntargeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved.

Patients had to be treated in hospital for a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of \n\n8 days, until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures or hospital discharge. The patients had to be \n\nfollowed up to 30 days. In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the combined \n\nincidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a decrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk \n\nreduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined incidence was maintained after 30 days (from \n\n23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the SC \n\ninjection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicenter study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by an SC injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours or IV unfractionated \n\nheparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were also treated with  acetylsalicylic acid for a \n\nminimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was adjusted for severe renally impaired \n\npatients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The SC injections of enoxaparin sodium were given \n\nuntil hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days (whichever came first). \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last SC \n\nadministration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, IV bolus of 30 IU/ kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin \n\nsodium, if the last SC administration given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p<0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p<0.001). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p=0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage (a \n\nmeasure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group (10.1%) \n\nas compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of treatment \n\nwith enoxaparin sodium. \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated SC administration and after single IV administration. The quantitative determination of anti-Xa \n\nand anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic methods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after SC injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is close to \n\n100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after SC injection and achieves \n\napproximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single SC administration of 2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, \n\n100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours provided \n\ninitial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 88% of \n\nsteady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated SC administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily \n\nregimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about \n\n15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated SC administration of the 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nregimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single \n\ndose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated SC administration no accumulation takes \n\nplace. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after SC administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa activity. The \n\nmean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following SC injection and \n\nreaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nand 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour IV infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single SC dose to about 7 hours \n\nafter repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal.  However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n\n<30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) IV dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated SC 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is marginally \n\nhigher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese control \n\nsubjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-adjusted \n\nclearance in obese subjects with SC dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-SC 4,000 IU (40 mg) dose, \n\nthat anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men \n\n(<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week SC toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at  10 mg/kg/day in the 26-week \n\nSC and IV toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at SC doses of enoxaparin sodium up to 30 mg/kg/day did not \n\nreveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was found to have no effect \n\non fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at SC doses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\n10,000 IU/mL (100 mg/mL) solution for injection \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains enoxaparin sodium 6,000 IU anti-Xa activity (equivalent to 60 mg) in 0.6 \n\nmL water for injections. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a biological substance obtained by alkaline depolymerization of heparin benzyl ester \n\nderived from porcine intestinal mucosa. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n\nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in particular \nthose undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility at \n\nincreased risk of venous thromboembolism.  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to require \nthrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), in \n\ncombination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to be \nmanaged medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk surgery.  \n\nIn moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of 7-\n\n10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the patient no \n\nlonger has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by SC injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there is a need for \n\nearlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high risk patient \n\nwaiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no later than \n\n12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis \nup to 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal \nor pelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by SC injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. \n\nmobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered SC either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) or as \n\ntwice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by SC injection administered in combination with antiplatelet \n\ntherapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until clinical \n\nstabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral loading \n\ndose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of 75–325 mg/day \n\nlong-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous (IV) \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nadministered SC every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the first two SC doses). \n\nAppropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) should be \n\nadministered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The recommended duration of treatment is 8 days or \n\nuntil hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic \n\n(fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin sodium should be given between 15 minutes before \n\nand 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last dose of enoxaparin sodium SC was given less than \n\n8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last SC administration \n\nwas given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nenoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥75 years of age, an initial IV bolus must not be used. \n\nInitiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU (75 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two SC doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC dosing for the remaining doses). For dosage \n\nin elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\n Severe renal impairment  \nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\n \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease  \n\n \n\n2,000 IU (20 mg) SC once daily \n\nTreatment of  DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC and then 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC every 24 hours \n\n \n\nNo IV initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC every 24 hours \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\n Moderate and mild renal impairment \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-\n\n50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring is \n\nadvised. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by SC injection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a \nSC injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe pre-filled disposable syringe is ready for immediate use.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using ampoules or multiple-dose vials to \n\nassure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\n SC injection technique: \nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep SC injection.  \n\n \n\nDo not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when using pre-\n\nfilled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the patient’s body \n\nweight, use the graduated pre-filled syringes to reach the required volume by discarding the excess before \n\ninjection. Please be aware that in some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the graduations \n\non the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. Do not rub the \n\ninjection site after administration. \n\n \n\nNote for the pre-filled syringes fitted with an automatic safety system: The safety system is triggered at the \n\nend of the injection (see instructions in section 6.6). \n\n \n\nIn case of self-administration, patient should be advised to follow instructions provided in the patient \n\ninformation leaflet included in the pack of this medicine. \n\n \n\n IV (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only): \nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a SC \n\ninjection.  \n\nFor IV injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an IV line. It should not be mixed or co-administered \n\nwith other medications. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other drugs, the IV access \n\nchosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the IV \n\nbolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to clear the port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely \n\nadministered with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water. \n\n \n\no Initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the IV line. \n\n \n\no Additional bolus for PCI when last SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be administered if \n\nlast SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% \n\ndextrose in water) as follows:  \n\nWithdraw 30 mL from the infusion bag with a syringe and discard the liquid. Inject the complete contents of \n\nthe 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe into the 20 mL remaining in the bag. Gently mix \n\nthe contents of the bag. Withdraw the required volume of diluted solution with a syringe for administration \n\ninto the IV line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below. It is recommended to prepare \n\nthe dilution immediately before use. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nVolume to be injected through IV line after dilution is completed at a concentration of 300 IU (3 mg) /mL. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\n \n\nRequired dose \n\n 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nVolume to inject when \n\ndiluted to a final \n\nconcentration of  \n\n 300 IU (3 mg) / mL \n\n \n\n[kg] \n\n \n\nIU \n\n \n\n[mg] \n\n \n\n[mL] \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n1350 \n\n \n\n13.5 \n\n \n\n4.5 \n\n50 1500 15 5 \n\n55 1650 16.5 5.5 \n\n60 1800 18 6 \n\n65 1950 19.5 6.5 \n\n70 2100 21 7 \n\n75 2250 22.5 7.5 \n\n80 2400 24 8 \n\n85 2550 25.5 8.5 \n\n90 2700 27 9 \n\n95 2850 28.5 9.5 \n\n100 3000 30 10 \n\n105 3150 31.5 10.5 \n\n110 3300 33 11 \n\n115 3450 34.5 11.5 \n\n120 3600 36 12 \n\n125 3750 37.5 12.5 \n\n130 3900 39 13 \n\n135 4050 40.5 13.5 \n\n140 4200 42 14 \n\n145 4350 43.5 14.5 \n\n150 4500 45 15 \n\n  \n\n \n\n Arterial line injection: \nIt is administered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit for the prevention of thrombus formation in the \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \nClinical monitoring and laboratory tests [prothrombin time expressed as the International Normalized \n\nRatio (INR)] must be intensified to monitor the effect of VKA. \n\nAs there is an interval before the VKA reaches its maximum effect, enoxaparin sodium therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a constant dose for as long as necessary in order to maintain the INR within the desired \n\ntherapeutic range for the indication in two successive tests. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a VKA, the VKA should be discontinued and the first dose of enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given when the INR has dropped below the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) \nFor patients currently receiving enoxaparin sodium, discontinue enoxaparin sodium and start the DOAC 0 to \n\n2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of enoxaparin sodium would be due as per \n\nDOAC label. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a DOAC, the first dose of enoxaparin sodium should be given at the time the \n\nnext DOAC dose would be taken. \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\nAdministration in spinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture  \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, careful neurological monitoring is recommended due to the risk of \n\nneuraxial haematomas (see section 4.4).  \n\n- At doses used for prophylaxis \nA puncture-free interval of at least 12 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at prophylactic doses and the needle or catheter placement. \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of at least 12 hours should be observed before removing \n\nthe catheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 24 hours. \n\nThe 2 hours preoperative initiation of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) is not compatible with \n\nneuraxial anaesthesia. \n\n- At doses used for treatment \nA puncture-free interval of at least 24 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at curative doses and the needle or catheter placement (see also section 4.3).  \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of 24 hours should be observed before removing the \n\ncatheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 48 hours. \n\nPatients receiving the twice daily doses (i.e. 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) twice daily or 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice-daily) should omit the second enoxaparin sodium dose to allow a sufficient delay \n\nbefore catheter placement or removal.  \n\nAnti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial \n\nhematoma will be avoided.  \n\nLikewise, consider not using enoxaparin sodium until at least 4 hours after the spinal/epidural puncture or \n\nafter the catheter has been removed. The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\n General \nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\n History of HIT (>100 days) \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (>100 days) of heparin-\n\ninduced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such a \n\ncase must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments \n\nare considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \n\n Monitoring of platelet counts \nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n\n \n\n Haemorrhage \nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medications affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n Laboratory tests \nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\n Spinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach a \n\nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance [15--\n\n30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is more \n\nprolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\n Skin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\n Percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last IV/SC enoxaparin sodium injection. If the treatment with \n\nenoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours \n\nafter sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma \n\nformation. \n\n \n\n Acute infective endocarditis \nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after a \n\ncareful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\n Mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\n Pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg ) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Elderly \nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\n Renal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which increases the \n\nrisk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological monitoring by anti-\n\nXa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\n Hepatic impairment \nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Low weight \nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (<45 kg) and low-weight men (<57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Obese Patients \nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Hyperkalaemia \nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\n Traceability \nLMWHs are biological medicinal products. In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n  \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended:  \n\n Medicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution: \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\n Other medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n\n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n \n\n Medicinal products increasing potassium levels: \nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely.  Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis \n\nfollowing surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment of DVT \n\nwith or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC \n\ndose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) SC dose once a day. In the clinical studies for treatment of \n\nunstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours, \n\nand in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI enoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) \n\nIV bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see section 4.4 and 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ \n\n1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\n Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \n\n Rare: Eosinophilia* \n\n Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Common: Allergic reaction \n\n Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees of \nneurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of normality) \n\n Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury *  \n\n Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema  \n\n Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \n\n Rare: Alopecia* \n\n Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena have \nbeen usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\nInjection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \n\nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\n Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\n Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\n Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medications affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSystem \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\n \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n  \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and \n\ngastro-intestinal haemorrhage. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\n \n\nSyste\n\nm \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymph\n\natic \n\nsystem \n\ndisord\n\ners \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n \n\nVery common:    \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns \nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nCommon:  \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nVery rare:     \n\nImmuno-\n\nallergic \n\nthrombocytope\n\nnia \nβ\n: Platelet increased >400 G/L  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\nAccidental overdose with enoxaparin sodium after IV, extracorporeal or SC administration may lead to \n\nhaemorrhagic complications. Following oral administration of even large doses, it is unlikely that enoxaparin \n\nsodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow IV injection of protamine. The dose of \n\nprotamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the anticoagulant \n\neffect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the previous \n\n8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be administered if \n\nenoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine administration, or if it \n\nhas been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the enoxaparin sodium \n\ninjection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses of protamine, the \n\nanti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about 60%) (see the \n\nprescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\n Extended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, 179 \n\npatients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) SC, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) (n=90) once a day SC or to placebo (n=89) for 3 weeks. The incidence of DVT during extended \n\nprophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo, no PE was reported. No \n\nmajor bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nAll Treated Extended Prophylaxis \n\nPatients \n90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)*  18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n# \n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo =0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo =0.537 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC were randomized to a \n\npost-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=131) once a day SC or to placebo \n\n(n=131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during extended prophylaxis was \n\nsignificantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE (enoxaparin sodium 21 \n\n[16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p=0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium 8 [6.1%] versus placebo \n\n28 [21.4%]; p=<0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the enoxaparin sodium and the \n\nplacebo group. \n\n \n\n Extended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \nA double-blind, multicenter trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) SC) daily for 6 to 10 days and were \n\nthen randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. Bilateral \n\nvenography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous thromboembolism \n\noccurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for four weeks after \n\nsurgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of venographically demonstrated \n\nthrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. The rates of venous \n\nthromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n=20) in the placebo group and 4.8% \n\n(n=8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p=0.02. This difference persisted at three months [13.8% vs. 5.5% \n\n(n=23 vs 9), p=0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other complications during the \n\ndouble-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicenter, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day SC was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients with \n\nseverely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of <10 meters for ≤3 days). \n\nThis study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated.

A total \n\nof 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. All patients also received warfarin \n\nsodium (dose adjusted according to prothrombin time to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within \n\n72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the \n\ntargeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved.

Patients had to be treated in hospital for a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of \n\n8 days, until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures or hospital discharge. The patients had to be \n\nfollowed up to 30 days. In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the combined \n\nincidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a decrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk \n\nreduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined incidence was maintained after 30 days (from \n\n23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the SC \n\ninjection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicenter study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by an SC injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours or IV unfractionated \n\nheparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were also treated with  acetylsalicylic acid for a \n\nminimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was adjusted for severe renally impaired \n\npatients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The SC injections of enoxaparin sodium were given \n\nuntil hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days (whichever came first). \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last SC \n\nadministration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, IV bolus of 30 IU/ kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin \n\nsodium, if the last SC administration given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p<0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p<0.001). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p=0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage (a \n\nmeasure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group (10.1%) \n\nas compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of treatment \n\nwith enoxaparin sodium. \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated SC administration and after single IV administration. The quantitative determination of anti-Xa \n\nand anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic methods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after SC injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is close to \n\n100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after SC injection and achieves \n\napproximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single SC administration of 2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, \n\n100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours provided \n\ninitial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 88% of \n\nsteady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated SC administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily \n\nregimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about \n\n15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated SC administration of the 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nregimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single \n\ndose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated SC administration no accumulation takes \n\nplace. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after SC administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa activity. The \n\nmean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following SC injection and \n\nreaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nand 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour IV infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single SC dose to about 7 hours \n\nafter repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal.  However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n\n<30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) IV dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated SC 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is marginally \n\nhigher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese control \n\nsubjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-adjusted \n\nclearance in obese subjects with SC dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-SC 4,000 IU (40 mg) dose, \n\nthat anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men \n\n(<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week SC toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at  10 mg/kg/day in the 26-week \n\nSC and IV toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at SC doses of enoxaparin sodium up to 30 mg/kg/day did not \n\nreveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was found to have no effect \n\non fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at SC doses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\n10,000 IU/mL (100 mg/mL) solution for injection: \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains enoxaparin sodium 8,000 IU anti-Xa activity (equivalent to 80 mg) in \n\n0.8 mL water for injections. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a biological substance obtained by alkaline depolymerization of heparin benzyl ester \n\nderived from porcine intestinal mucosa. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n\nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in particular \nthose undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility at \n\nincreased risk of venous thromboembolism.  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to require \nthrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), in \n\ncombination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to be \nmanaged medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n\n \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk surgery.  \n\nIn moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of 7-\n\n10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the patient no \n\nlonger has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by SC injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there is a need for \n\nearlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high risk patient \n\nwaiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no later than \n\n12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis \nup to 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal \nor pelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by SC injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. \n\nmobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered SC either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) or as \n\ntwice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by SC injection administered in combination with antiplatelet \n\ntherapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until clinical \n\nstabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral loading \n\ndose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of 75–325 mg/day \n\nlong-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous (IV) \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nadministered SC every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the first two SC doses). \n\nAppropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) should be \n\nadministered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The recommended duration of treatment is 8 days or \n\nuntil hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic \n\n(fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin sodium should be given between 15 minutes before \n\nand 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last dose of enoxaparin sodium SC was given less than \n\n8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last SC administration \n\nwas given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nenoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established. \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥75 years of age, an initial IV bolus must not be used. \n\nInitiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU (75 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two SC doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC dosing for the remaining doses). For dosage \n\nin elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\n Severe renal impairment  \nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\n \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease  \n\n \n\n2,000 IU (20 mg) SC once daily \n\nTreatment of  DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC and then 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC every 24 hours \n\n \n\nNo IV initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC every 24 hours \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\n Moderate and mild renal impairment \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n\n \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-\n\n50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring is \n\nadvised. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by SC injection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a \nSC injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe pre-filled disposable syringe is ready for immediate use.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using ampoules or multiple-dose vials to \n\nassure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\n SC injection technique: \nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep SC injection.  \n\n \n\nDo not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when using pre-\n\nfilled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the patient’s body \n\nweight, use the graduated pre-filled syringes to reach the required volume by discarding the excess before \n\ninjection. Please be aware that in some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the graduations \n\non the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. Do not rub the \n\ninjection site after administration. \n\n \n\nNote for the pre-filled syringes fitted with an automatic safety system: The safety system is triggered at the \n\nend of the injection (see instructions in section 6.6). \n\n \n\nIn case of self-administration, patient should be advised to follow instructions provided in the patient \n\ninformation leaflet included in the pack of this medicine. \n\n \n\n IV (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only): \nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a SC \n\ninjection.  \n\nFor IV injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an IV line. It should not be mixed or co-administered \n\nwith other medications. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other drugs, the IV access \n\nchosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the IV \n\nbolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to clear the port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely \n\nadministered with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water. \n\n \n\no Initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n\n \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the IV line. \n\n \n\no Additional bolus for PCI when last SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be administered if \n\nlast SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% \n\ndextrose in water) as follows:  \n\nWithdraw 30 mL from the infusion bag with a syringe and discard the liquid. Inject the complete contents of \n\nthe 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe into the 20 mL remaining in the bag. Gently mix \n\nthe contents of the bag. Withdraw the required volume of diluted solution with a syringe for administration \n\ninto the IV line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below. It is recommended to prepare \n\nthe dilution immediately before use. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\nVolume to be injected through IV line after dilution is completed at a concentration of 300 IU (3 mg) /mL. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\n \n\nRequired dose \n\n 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nVolume to inject when \n\ndiluted to a final \n\nconcentration of  \n\n 300 IU (3 mg) / mL \n\n \n\n[kg] \n\n \n\nIU \n\n \n\n[mg] \n\n \n\n[mL] \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n1350 \n\n \n\n13.5 \n\n \n\n4.5 \n\n50 1500 15 5 \n\n55 1650 16.5 5.5 \n\n60 1800 18 6 \n\n65 1950 19.5 6.5 \n\n70 2100 21 7 \n\n75 2250 22.5 7.5 \n\n80 2400 24 8 \n\n85 2550 25.5 8.5 \n\n90 2700 27 9 \n\n95 2850 28.5 9.5 \n\n100 3000 30 10 \n\n105 3150 31.5 10.5 \n\n110 3300 33 11 \n\n115 3450 34.5 11.5 \n\n120 3600 36 12 \n\n125 3750 37.5 12.5 \n\n130 3900 39 13 \n\n135 4050 40.5 13.5 \n\n140 4200 42 14 \n\n145 4350 43.5 14.5 \n\n150 4500 45 15 \n\n  \n\n \n\n Arterial line injection: \nIt is administered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit for the prevention of thrombus formation in the \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \nClinical monitoring and laboratory tests [prothrombin time expressed as the International Normalized \n\nRatio (INR)] must be intensified to monitor the effect of VKA. \n\nAs there is an interval before the VKA reaches its maximum effect, enoxaparin sodium therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a constant dose for as long as necessary in order to maintain the INR within the desired \n\ntherapeutic range for the indication in two successive tests. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a VKA, the VKA should be discontinued and the first dose of enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given when the INR has dropped below the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) \nFor patients currently receiving enoxaparin sodium, discontinue enoxaparin sodium and start the DOAC 0 to \n\n2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of enoxaparin sodium would be due as per \n\nDOAC label. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a DOAC, the first dose of enoxaparin sodium should be given at the time the \n\nnext DOAC dose would be taken. \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\n \n\nAdministration in spinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture  \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, careful neurological monitoring is recommended due to the risk of \n\nneuraxial haematomas (see section 4.4).  \n\n- At doses used for prophylaxis \nA puncture-free interval of at least 12 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at prophylactic doses and the needle or catheter placement. \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of at least 12 hours should be observed before removing \n\nthe catheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 24 hours. \n\nThe 2 hours preoperative initiation of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) is not compatible with \n\nneuraxial anaesthesia. \n\n- At doses used for treatment \nA puncture-free interval of at least 24 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at curative doses and the needle or catheter placement (see also section 4.3).  \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of 24 hours should be observed before removing the \n\ncatheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 48 hours. \n\nPatients receiving the twice daily doses (i.e. 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) twice daily or 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice-daily) should omit the second enoxaparin sodium dose to allow a sufficient delay \n\nbefore catheter placement or removal.  \n\nAnti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial \n\nhematoma will be avoided.  \n\nLikewise, consider not using enoxaparin sodium until at least 4 hours after the spinal/epidural puncture or \n\nafter the catheter has been removed. The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\n General \nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\n History of HIT (>100 days) \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n\n \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (>100 days) of heparin-\n\ninduced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such a \n\ncase must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments \n\nare considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \n\n Monitoring of platelet counts \nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n\n \n\n Haemorrhage \nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medications affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n Laboratory tests \nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\n Spinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n88 \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach a \n\nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance [15--\n\n30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is more \n\nprolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\n Skin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\n Percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last IV/SC enoxaparin sodium injection. If the treatment with \n\nenoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours \n\nafter sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma \n\nformation. \n\n \n\n Acute infective endocarditis \nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after a \n\ncareful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\n Mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\n Pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg ) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Elderly \nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n\n \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\n Renal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which increases the \n\nrisk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological monitoring by anti-\n\nXa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\n Hepatic impairment \nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Low weight \nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (<45 kg) and low-weight men (<57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Obese Patients \nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Hyperkalaemia \nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\n Traceability \nLMWHs are biological medicinal products. In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n  \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended:  \n\n Medicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n\n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution: \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\n Other medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n\n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n \n\n Medicinal products increasing potassium levels: \nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely.  Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis \n\nfollowing surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment of DVT \n\nwith or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC \n\ndose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) SC dose once a day. In the clinical studies for treatment of \n\nunstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours, \n\nand in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI enoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) \n\nIV bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see section 4.4 and 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ \n\n1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\n Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \n\n Rare: Eosinophilia* \n\n Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Common: Allergic reaction \n\n Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees of \nneurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of normality) \n\n Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury *  \n\n Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema  \n\n Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \n\n Rare: Alopecia* \n\n Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena have \nbeen usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\nInjection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \n\nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\n Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n92 \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\n Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\n Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medications affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSystem \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\n \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n  \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and \n\ngastro-intestinal haemorrhage. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\n \n\nSyste\n\nm \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymph\n\natic \n\nsystem \n\ndisord\n\ners \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n \n\nVery common:    \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns \nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nCommon:  \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nVery rare:     \n\nImmuno-\n\nallergic \n\nthrombocytope\n\nnia \nβ\n: Platelet increased >400 G/L  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\nAccidental overdose with enoxaparin sodium after IV, extracorporeal or SC administration may lead to \n\nhaemorrhagic complications. Following oral administration of even large doses, it is unlikely that enoxaparin \n\nsodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow IV injection of protamine. The dose of \n\nprotamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the anticoagulant \n\neffect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the previous \n\n8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be administered if \n\nenoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine administration, or if it \n\nhas been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the enoxaparin sodium \n\ninjection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses of protamine, the \n\nanti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about 60%) (see the \n\nprescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\n Extended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, 179 \n\npatients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) SC, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) (n=90) once a day SC or to placebo (n=89) for 3 weeks. The incidence of DVT during extended \n\nprophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo, no PE was reported. No \n\nmajor bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nAll Treated Extended Prophylaxis \n\nPatients \n90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)*  18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n# \n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo =0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo =0.537 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC were randomized to a \n\npost-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=131) once a day SC or to placebo \n\n(n=131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during extended prophylaxis was \n\nsignificantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE (enoxaparin sodium 21 \n\n[16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p=0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium 8 [6.1%] versus placebo \n\n28 [21.4%]; p=<0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the enoxaparin sodium and the \n\nplacebo group. \n\n \n\n Extended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \nA double-blind, multicenter trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) SC) daily for 6 to 10 days and were \n\nthen randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. Bilateral \n\nvenography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous thromboembolism \n\noccurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for four weeks after \n\nsurgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of venographically demonstrated \n\nthrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. The rates of venous \n\nthromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n=20) in the placebo group and 4.8% \n\n(n=8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p=0.02. This difference persisted at three months [13.8% vs. 5.5% \n\n(n=23 vs 9), p=0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other complications during the \n\ndouble-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicenter, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day SC was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients with \n\nseverely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of <10 meters for ≤3 days). \n\nThis study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated.

In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the combined \n\nincidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a decrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk \n\nreduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined incidence was maintained after 30 days (from \n\n23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the SC \n\ninjection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicenter study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by an SC injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours or IV unfractionated \n\nheparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were also treated with  acetylsalicylic acid for a \n\nminimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was adjusted for severe renally impaired \n\npatients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The SC injections of enoxaparin sodium were given \n\nuntil hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days (whichever came first). \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last SC \n\nadministration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, IV bolus of 30 IU/ kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin \n\nsodium, if the last SC administration given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p<0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p<0.001). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p=0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage (a \n\nmeasure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group (10.1%) \n\nas compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of treatment \n\nwith enoxaparin sodium. \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\n \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated SC administration and after single IV administration. The quantitative determination of anti-Xa \n\nand anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic methods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after SC injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is close to \n\n100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after SC injection and achieves \n\napproximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single SC administration of 2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, \n\n100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours provided \n\ninitial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 88% of \n\nsteady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated SC administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily \n\nregimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about \n\n15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated SC administration of the 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nregimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single \n\ndose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated SC administration no accumulation takes \n\nplace. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after SC administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa activity. The \n\nmean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following SC injection and \n\nreaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nand 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour IV infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single SC dose to about 7 hours \n\nafter repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal.  However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n\n<30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) IV dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated SC 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is marginally \n\nhigher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese control \n\nsubjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-adjusted \n\nclearance in obese subjects with SC dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-SC 4,000 IU (40 mg) dose, \n\nthat anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men \n\n(<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week SC toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at  10 mg/kg/day in the 26-week \n\nSC and IV toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n\n \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at SC doses of enoxaparin sodium up to 30 mg/kg/day did not \n\nreveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was found to have no effect \n\non fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at SC doses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in particular \nthose undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility at \n\nincreased risk of venous thromboembolism.  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to require \nthrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), in \n\ncombination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to be \nmanaged medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n\n \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk surgery.  \n\nIn moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of 7-\n\n10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the patient no \n\nlonger has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by SC injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there is a need for \n\nearlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high risk patient \n\nwaiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no later than \n\n12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis \nup to 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal \nor pelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by SC injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. \n\nmobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered SC either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) or as \n\ntwice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by SC injection administered in combination with antiplatelet \n\ntherapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until clinical \n\nstabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral loading \n\ndose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of 75–325 mg/day \n\nlong-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n\n \n\n \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous (IV) \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nadministered SC every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the first two SC doses). \n\nAppropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) should be \n\nadministered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The recommended duration of treatment is 8 days or \n\nuntil hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic \n\n(fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin sodium should be given between 15 minutes before \n\nand 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last dose of enoxaparin sodium SC was given less than \n\n8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last SC administration \n\nwas given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nenoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established. \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥75 years of age, an initial IV bolus must not be used. \n\nInitiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU (75 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two SC doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) SC dosing for the remaining doses). For dosage \n\nin elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\n Severe renal impairment  \nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\n \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease  \n\n \n\n2,000 IU (20 mg) SC once daily \n\nTreatment of  DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight SC once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC and then 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight SC every 24 hours \n\n \n\nNo IV initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight SC every 24 hours \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\n Moderate and mild renal impairment \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n\n \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-\n\n50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring is \n\nadvised. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by SC injection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a \nSC injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe pre-filled disposable syringe is ready for immediate use.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using ampoules or multiple-dose vials to \n\nassure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\n SC injection technique: \nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep SC injection.  \n\n \n\nDo not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when using pre-\n\nfilled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the patient’s body \n\nweight, use the graduated pre-filled syringes to reach the required volume by discarding the excess before \n\ninjection. Please be aware that in some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the graduations \n\non the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. Do not rub the \n\ninjection site after administration. \n\n \n\nNote for the pre-filled syringes fitted with an automatic safety system: The safety system is triggered at the \n\nend of the injection (see instructions in section 6.6). \n\n \n\nIn case of self-administration, patient should be advised to follow instructions provided in the patient \n\ninformation leaflet included in the pack of this medicine. \n\n \n\n IV (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only): \nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single IV bolus injection immediately followed by a SC \n\ninjection.  \n\nFor IV injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an IV line. It should not be mixed or co-administered \n\nwith other medications. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other drugs, the IV access \n\nchosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the IV \n\nbolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to clear the port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely \n\nadministered with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water. \n\n \n\no Initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\n\n\n \n\n110 \n\n \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the IV line. \n\n \n\no Additional bolus for PCI when last SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional IV bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be administered if \n\nlast SC administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% \n\ndextrose in water) as follows:  \n\nWithdraw 30 mL from the infusion bag with a syringe and discard the liquid. Inject the complete contents of \n\nthe 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe into the 20 mL remaining in the bag. Gently mix \n\nthe contents of the bag. Withdraw the required volume of diluted solution with a syringe for administration \n\ninto the IV line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below. It is recommended to prepare \n\nthe dilution immediately before use. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n\n \n\nVolume to be injected through IV line after dilution is completed at a concentration of 300 IU (3 mg) /mL. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\n \n\nRequired dose \n\n 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nVolume to inject when \n\ndiluted to a final \n\nconcentration of  \n\n 300 IU (3 mg) / mL \n\n \n\n[kg] \n\n \n\nIU \n\n \n\n[mg] \n\n \n\n[mL] \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n1350 \n\n \n\n13.5 \n\n \n\n4.5 \n\n50 1500 15 5 \n\n55 1650 16.5 5.5 \n\n60 1800 18 6 \n\n65 1950 19.5 6.5 \n\n70 2100 21 7 \n\n75 2250 22.5 7.5 \n\n80 2400 24 8 \n\n85 2550 25.5 8.5 \n\n90 2700 27 9 \n\n95 2850 28.5 9.5 \n\n100 3000 30 10 \n\n105 3150 31.5 10.5 \n\n110 3300 33 11 \n\n115 3450 34.5 11.5 \n\n120 3600 36 12 \n\n125 3750 37.5 12.5 \n\n130 3900 39 13 \n\n135 4050 40.5 13.5 \n\n140 4200 42 14 \n\n145 4350 43.5 14.5 \n\n150 4500 45 15 \n\n  \n\n \n\n Arterial line injection: \nIt is administered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit for the prevention of thrombus formation in the \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \nClinical monitoring and laboratory tests [prothrombin time expressed as the International Normalized \n\nRatio (INR)] must be intensified to monitor the effect of VKA. \n\nAs there is an interval before the VKA reaches its maximum effect, enoxaparin sodium therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a constant dose for as long as necessary in order to maintain the INR within the desired \n\ntherapeutic range for the indication in two successive tests. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a VKA, the VKA should be discontinued and the first dose of enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given when the INR has dropped below the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\n Switch between enoxaparin sodium and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) \nFor patients currently receiving enoxaparin sodium, discontinue enoxaparin sodium and start the DOAC 0 to \n\n2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of enoxaparin sodium would be due as per \n\nDOAC label. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a DOAC, the first dose of enoxaparin sodium should be given at the time the \n\nnext DOAC dose would be taken. \n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n\n \n\n \n\nAdministration in spinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture  \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, careful neurological monitoring is recommended due to the risk of \n\nneuraxial haematomas (see section 4.4).  \n\n- At doses used for prophylaxis \nA puncture-free interval of at least 12 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at prophylactic doses and the needle or catheter placement. \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of at least 12 hours should be observed before removing \n\nthe catheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 24 hours. \n\nThe 2 hours preoperative initiation of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) is not compatible with \n\nneuraxial anaesthesia. \n\n- At doses used for treatment \nA puncture-free interval of at least 24 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin \n\nsodium at curative doses and the needle or catheter placement (see also section 4.3).  \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of 24 hours should be observed before removing the \n\ncatheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of \n\npuncture/catheter placement or removal to at least 48 hours. \n\nPatients receiving the twice daily doses (i.e. 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) twice daily or 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice-daily) should omit the second enoxaparin sodium dose to allow a sufficient delay \n\nbefore catheter placement or removal.  \n\nAnti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial \n\nhematoma will be avoided.  \n\nLikewise, consider not using enoxaparin sodium until at least 4 hours after the spinal/epidural puncture or \n\nafter the catheter has been removed. The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\n General \nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\n History of HIT (>100 days) \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n\n \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (>100 days) of heparin-\n\ninduced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such a \n\ncase must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments \n\nare considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \n\n Monitoring of platelet counts \nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n\n \n\n Haemorrhage \nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medications affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n Laboratory tests \nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\n Spinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach a \n\nsufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance [15--\n\n30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is more \n\nprolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\n Skin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\n Percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last IV/SC enoxaparin sodium injection. If the treatment with \n\nenoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours \n\nafter sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma \n\nformation. \n\n \n\n Acute infective endocarditis \nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after a \n\ncareful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\n Mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\n Pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg ) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Elderly \nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n\n \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\n Renal impairment \nIn patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which increases the \n\nrisk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological monitoring by anti-\n\nXa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 \n\nmL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\n Hepatic impairment \nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Low weight \nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (<45 kg) and low-weight men (<57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n Obese Patients \nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\n \n\n Hyperkalaemia \nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\n Traceability \nLMWHs are biological medicinal products. In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n  \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended:  \n\n Medicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n\n \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution: \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\n Other medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n\n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n \n\n Medicinal products increasing potassium levels: \nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely.  Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis \n\nfollowing surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment of DVT \n\nwith or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC \n\ndose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) SC dose once a day. In the clinical studies for treatment of \n\nunstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours, \n\nand in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI enoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) \n\nIV bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see section 4.4 and 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ \n\n1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\n Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \n\n Rare: Eosinophilia* \n\n Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Common: Allergic reaction \n\n Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees of \nneurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of normality) \n\n Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury *  \n\n Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema  \n\n Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \n\n Rare: Alopecia* \n\n Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena have \nbeen usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\nInjection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \n\nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\n Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\n Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\n Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medications affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSystem \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\n \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n  \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and \n\ngastro-intestinal haemorrhage. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\n \n\nSyste\n\nm \n\nOrgan \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymph\n\natic \n\nsystem \n\ndisord\n\ners \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n \n\nVery common:    \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns \nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nCommon:  \n\nThrombocytosi\n\ns\nβ\n \n\nThrombocytop\n\nenia \n\nVery rare:     \n\nImmuno-\n\nallergic \n\nthrombocytope\n\nnia \nβ\n: Platelet increased >400 G/L  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nMultiple dose vials containing benzyl alcohol: \n\nThe administration of medicinal product containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative to neonates has been \n\nassociated with a fatal “Gasping Syndrome” (see section 4.3). \n\nBenzyl alcohol may also cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up to 3 \n\nyears old (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\nAccidental overdose with enoxaparin sodium after IV, extracorporeal or SC administration may lead to \n\nhaemorrhagic complications. Following oral administration of even large doses, it is unlikely that enoxaparin \n\nsodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow IV injection of protamine. The dose of \n\nprotamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the anticoagulant \n\neffect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the previous \n\n8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be administered if \n\nenoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine administration, or if it \n\nhas been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the enoxaparin sodium \n\ninjection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses of protamine, the \n\nanti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about 60%) (see the \n\nprescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n120 \n\n \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\n Extended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, 179 \n\npatients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) SC, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) (n=90) once a day SC or to placebo (n=89) for 3 weeks. The incidence of DVT during extended \n\nprophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo, no PE was reported. No \n\nmajor bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day SC \n\nn (%) \n\nAll Treated Extended Prophylaxis \n\nPatients \n90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)*  18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n# \n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo =0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo =0.537 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) SC were randomized to a \n\npost-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=131) once a day SC or to placebo \n\n(n=131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during extended prophylaxis was \n\nsignificantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE (enoxaparin sodium 21 \n\n[16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p=0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium 8 [6.1%] versus placebo \n\n28 [21.4%]; p=<0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the enoxaparin sodium and the \n\nplacebo group. \n\n \n\n Extended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \nA double-blind, multicenter trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) SC) daily for 6 to 10 days and were \n\nthen randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. Bilateral \n\nvenography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous thromboembolism \n\noccurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for four weeks after \n\nsurgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of venographically demonstrated \n\nthrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. The rates of venous \n\nthromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n=20) in the placebo group and 4.8% \n\n(n=8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p=0.02. This difference persisted at three months [13.8% vs. 5.5% \n\n(n=23 vs 9), p=0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other complications during the \n\ndouble-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicenter, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day SC was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients with \n\nseverely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of <10 meters for ≤3 days). \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\n \n\nThis study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated. Treatment continued for \n\n6 to 14 days (median duration 7 days). When given at a dose of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day SC, enoxaparin \n\nsodium significantly reduced the incidence of VTE as compared to placebo.

A total \n\nof 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. All patients also received warfarin \n\nsodium (dose adjusted according to prothrombin time to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within \n\n72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the \n\ntargeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved.  Both enoxaparin sodium regimens were equivalent to standard \n\nheparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE).

Patients had to be treated in hospital for a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of \n\n8 days, until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures or hospital discharge. The patients had to be \n\nfollowed up to 30 days. In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the combined \n\nincidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a decrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk \n\nreduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined incidence was maintained after 30 days (from \n\n23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the SC \n\ninjection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicenter study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus plus a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) SC dose followed by an SC injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours or IV unfractionated \n\nheparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were also treated with  acetylsalicylic acid for a \n\nminimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was adjusted for severe renally impaired \n\npatients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The SC injections of enoxaparin sodium were given \n\nuntil hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days (whichever came first). \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last SC \n\nadministration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, IV bolus of 30 IU/ kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin \n\nsodium, if the last SC administration given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p<0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p<0.001). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p=0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage (a \n\nmeasure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group (10.1%) \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n\n \n\nas compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of treatment \n\nwith enoxaparin sodium. \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated SC administration and after single IV administration. The quantitative determination of anti-Xa \n\nand anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic methods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after SC injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is close to \n\n100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after SC injection and achieves \n\napproximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single SC administration of 2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, \n\n100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) IV bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) SC every 12 hours provided \n\ninitial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure corresponding to 88% of \n\nsteady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated SC administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily \n\nregimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio about \n\n15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated SC administration of the 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nregimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% higher than after a single \n\ndose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and 0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated SC administration no accumulation takes \n\nplace. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after SC administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa activity. The \n\nmean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following SC injection and \n\nreaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily \n\nand 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n\n \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour IV infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single SC dose to about 7 hours \n\nafter repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal.  However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n\n<30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated SC \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) IV dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated SC 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is marginally \n\nhigher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese control \n\nsubjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-adjusted \n\nclearance in obese subjects with SC dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-SC 4,000 IU (40 mg) dose, \n\nthat anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-weight men \n\n(<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week SC toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at  10 mg/kg/day in the 26-week \n\nSC and IV toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at SC doses of enoxaparin sodium up to 30 mg/kg/day did not \n\nreveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was found to have no effect \n\non fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at SC doses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains enoxaparin sodium 12,000 IU anti-Xa activity (equivalent to 120 mg) in \n\n0.8 mL water for injections. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a biological substance obtained by alkaline depolymerisation of heparin benzyl ester \n\nderived from porcine intestinal mucosa. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n\nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in \nparticular those undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility \n\nat increased risk of venous thromboembolism.  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to \nrequire thrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), \n\nin combination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to \nbe managed medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk \n\nsurgery.  \n\n\n\n \n\n133 \n\n \n\nIn moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of \n\n7-10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the \n\npatient no longer has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by subcutaneous injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there \n\nis a need for earlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high \n\nrisk patient waiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no \n\nlater than 12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis \nup to 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal or \npelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status \n\n(e.g. mobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered subcutaneously either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg \n\n(1.5 mg/kg) or as twice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by subcutaneous injection administered in combination with \n\nantiplatelet therapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until \n\nclinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral loading \n\ndose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of 75–325 mg/day \n\nlong-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose followed by 100 IU/kg \n\n\n\n \n\n134 \n\n \n\n(1 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two subcutaneous doses). Appropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg \n\nto 325 mg once daily) should be administered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The \n\nrecommended duration of treatment is 8 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When \n\nadministered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic \n\ntherapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last dose of enoxaparin sodium was given less than \n\n8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last subcutaneous \n\nadministration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an intravenous bolus of \n\n30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥ 75 years of age, an initial intravenous bolus must not be \n\nused. Initiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneous injection every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU \n\n(75 mg) for each of the first two subcutaneous doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneous \n\ndosing for the remaining doses). For dosage in elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below \n\n“renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\nSevere renal impairment  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n\n< 15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease 2,000 IU (20 mg) subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\nNo intravenous initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\nModerate and mild renal impairment \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance \n\n30-50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring \n\nis advised. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by subcutaneous \n\ninjection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately \nfollowed by a subcutaneous injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe pre-filled disposable syringe is ready for immediate use.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using ampoules or multiple-dose vials to \n\nassure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous injection technique \n\nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep subcutaneous injection.  \n\n \n\nThe air bubble should not be expelled from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when \n\nusing pre-filled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the \n\npatient’s body weight, the graduated pre-filled syringes should be used to reach the required volume by \n\ndiscarding the excess before injection. In some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the \n\ngraduations on the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. The injection \n\nsite should not be rubbed after administration. \n\n \n\nNote for the pre-filled syringes fitted with an automatic safety system: The safety system is triggered at the \n\nend of the injection (see instructions in section 6.6). \n\n \n\nIn case of self-administration, patient should be advised to follow instructions provided in the patient \n\ninformation leaflet included in the pack of this medicine. \n\n \n\nIntravenous (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only) \n\nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately followed \n\nby a subcutaneous injection.  \n\nFor intravenous injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an intravenous line. It should not be mixed or \n\nco-administered with other medications. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other \n\ndrugs, the intravenous access chosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of sodium chloride or \n\ndextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to clear \n\nthe port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely administered with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection or 5% dextrose in water. \n\n \n\nInitial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n136 \n\n \n\nAdditional bolus for PCI when last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \n\ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional intravenous bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be \n\nadministered if last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or 5% dextrose in water) as follows:  \n\n30 mL of solution should be withdrawn from the infusion bag with a syringe and discarded. The complete \n\ncontents of the 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe should be injected into the 20 mL \n\nremaining in the bag. The contents of the bag should be gently mixed. Then, the required volume of diluted \n\nsolution should be withdrawn with a syringe for administration into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below. It is recommended to prepare \n\nthe dilution immediately before use. \n\n \n\nVolume to be injected through intravenous line after dilution is completed at a concentration of \n\n300 IU (3 mg)/mL. \n\n \n\nWeight \nRequired dose  \n\n30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nVolume to inject when diluted \n\nto a final concentration of  \n\n300 IU (3 mg)/mL \n\n[kg] IU [mg] [mL] \n\n45 1350 13.5 4.5 \n\n50 1500 15 5 \n\n55 1650 16.5 5.5 \n\n60 1800 18 6 \n\n65 1950 19.5 6.5 \n\n70 2100 21 7 \n\n75 2250 22.5 7.5 \n\n80 2400 24 8 \n\n85 2550 25.5 8.5 \n\n90 2700 27 9 \n\n95 2850 28.5 9.5 \n\n100 3000 30 10 \n\n105 3150 31.5 10.5 \n\n110 3300 33 11 \n\n115 3450 34.5 11.5 \n\n120 3600 36 12 \n\n125 3750 37.5 12.5 \n\n130 3900 39 13 \n\n135 4050 40.5 13.5 \n\n140 4200 42 14 \n\n145 4350 43.5 14.5 \n\n150 4500 45 15 \n\n \n\nArterial line injection \n\nIt is administered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit for the prevention of thrombus formation in the \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \n\nClinical monitoring and laboratory tests [prothrombin time expressed as the International Normalized Ratio \n\n(INR)] must be intensified to monitor the effect of VKA. \n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n\n \n\nAs there is an interval before the VKA reaches its maximum effect, enoxaparin sodium therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a constant dose for as long as necessary in order to maintain the INR within the desired \n\ntherapeutic range for the indication in two successive tests. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a VKA, the VKA should be discontinued and the first dose of enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given when the INR has dropped below the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) \n\nFor patients currently receiving enoxaparin sodium, discontinue enoxaparin sodium and start the DOAC 0 to \n\n2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of enoxaparin sodium would be due as per \n\nDOAC label. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a DOAC, the first dose of enoxaparin sodium should be given at the time the \n\nnext DOAC dose would be taken. \n\n \n\nAdministration in spinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture  \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, careful neurological monitoring is recommended due to the risk of \n\nneuraxial haematomas (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nAt doses used for prophylaxis \n\nA puncture-free interval of at least 12 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin sodium at \n\nprophylactic doses and the needle or catheter placement. \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of at least 12 hours should be observed before removing the \n\ncatheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of puncture/catheter \n\nplacement or removal to at least 24 hours. \n\nThe 2 hours preoperative initiation of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) is not compatible with neuraxial \n\nanaesthesia. \n\n \n\nAt doses used for treatment \n\nA puncture-free interval of at least 24 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin sodium at \n\ncurative doses and the needle or catheter placement (see also section 4.3).  \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of 24 hours should be observed before removing the catheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of puncture/catheter \n\nplacement or removal to at least 48 hours. \n\nPatients receiving the twice daily doses (i.e. 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) twice daily or 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\ntwice-daily) should omit the second enoxaparin sodium dose to allow a sufficient delay before catheter \n\nplacement or removal.  \n\n \n\nAnti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial \n\nhematoma will be avoided.  \n\nLikewise, consider not using enoxaparin sodium until at least 4 hours after the spinal/epidural puncture or \n\nafter the catheter has been removed. The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n\n\n \n\n138 \n\n \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nGeneral \n\nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\nHistory of HIT (> 100 days) \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (> 100 days) of \n\nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in \n\nsuch a case must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative \n\ntreatments are considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \nMonitoring of platelet counts \n\nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n\n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medications affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests \n\nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n\n \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nSpinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \n\nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach \n\na sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance \n\n[15-30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nmore prolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\nSkin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \n\nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\nPercutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \n\nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium injection. If the \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than \n\n6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or \n\nhematoma formation. \n\n \n\nAcute infective endocarditis \n\nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after \n\na careful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\nMechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n\n \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which increases the \n\nrisk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological monitoring by \n\nanti-Xa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n\n< 15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLow weight \n\nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and low-weight men (< 57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nObese Patients \n\nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\nTraceability \n\nLMWHs are biological medicinal products. In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n  \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \n\nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution \n\n \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\nOther medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products increasing potassium levels \n\nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely. Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n142 \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis following surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment \n\nof DVT with or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose once a day. In \n\nthe clinical studies for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hours, and in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI \n\nenoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nsubcutaneously every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see section 4.4 and 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\n Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \n\n Rare: Eosinophilia* \n\n Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Common: Allergic reaction \n\n Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees \nof neurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n\n \n\n Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of \nnormality) \n\n Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury*  \n\n Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema  \n\n Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \n\n Rare: Alopecia* \n\n Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena \nhave been usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\n Injection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\n Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\n Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\n Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medications affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical \n\npatients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and \n\ngastro-intestinal haemorrhage. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical \n\npatients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombocytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\n \n\nVery common:    \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nCommon:  \n\nThrombocytosis\nβ\n \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nVery rare:     \n\nImmuno-allergic \n\nthrombo-\n\ncytopenia \nβ\n: Platelet increased > 400 G/L  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\n \n\nAccidental overdose with enoxaparin sodium after intravenous, extracorporeal or subcutaneous \n\nadministration may lead to haemorrhagic complications. Following oral administration of even large doses, it \n\nis unlikely that enoxaparin sodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow intravenous injection of protamine. The dose \n\nof protamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the \n\nanticoagulant effect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the \n\nprevious 8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be \n\nadministered if enoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine \n\nadministration, or if it has been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the \n\nenoxaparin sodium injection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses \n\nof protamine, the anti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about \n\n60%) (see the prescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n145 \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\nExtended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \n\nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, \n\n179 patients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n = 90) once a day subcutaneously or to placebo (n = 89) for 3 weeks. The \n\nincidence of DVT during extended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to \n\nplacebo, no PE was reported. No major bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nAll Treated Extended Prophylaxis Patients 90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)*  18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n# \n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo = 0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo = 0.537 \n\n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously were \n\nrandomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n = 131) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously or to placebo (n = 131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during \n\nextended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE \n\n(enoxaparin sodium 21 [16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p = 0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium \n\n8 [6.1%] versus placebo 28 [21.4%]; p =< 0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the \n\nenoxaparin sodium and the placebo group. \n\n \n\nExtended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \n\nA double-blind, multicentre trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously) daily for 6 to 10 days \n\nand were then randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n146 \n\n \n\nBilateral venography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous \n\nthromboembolism occurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis \n\nfor four weeks after surgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of \n\nvenographically demonstrated thrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. \n\nThe rates of venous thromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n = 20) in the \n\nplacebo group and 4.8% (n = 8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p = 0.02. This difference persisted at three \n\nmonths [13.8% vs. 5.5% (n = 23 vs 9), p = 0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other \n\ncomplications during the double-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicentre, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day subcutaneously was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients \n\nwith severely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of < 10 meters for \n\n≤ 3 days). This study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥ 75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated. Treatment continued for \n\n6 to 14 days (median duration 7 days). When given at a dose of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day subcutaneously, \n\nenoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the incidence of VTE as compared to placebo.

A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were \n\ntreated. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to prothrombin time to achieve \n\nan INR of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin \n\ntherapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a \n\nminimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved.  Both enoxaparin sodium \n\nregimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous \n\nthromboembolism (DVT and/or PE).

Patients had to be treated in hospital for a minimum of \n\n2 days and a maximum of 8 days, until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures or hospital \n\ndischarge. The patients had to be followed up to 30 days. In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium \n\nsignificantly reduced the combined incidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a \n\ndecrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk reduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined \n\nincidence was maintained after 30 days (from 23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the \n\nsubcutaneous injection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicentre study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus \n\na 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose followed by an subcutaneous injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nevery 12 hours or intravenous unfractionated heparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were \n\nalso treated with acetylsalicylic acid for a minimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was \n\nadjusted for severe renally impaired patients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The subcutaneous \n\ninjections of enoxaparin sodium were given until hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days \n\n(whichever came first). \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last \n\nsubcutaneous administration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, intravenous bolus of 30 IU/ kg \n\n(0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium, if the last subcutaneous administration given more than 8 hours before \n\nballoon inflation. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p < 0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p < 0.001). \n\n\n\n \n\n148 \n\n \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p = 0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage \n\n(a measure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group \n\n(10.1%) as compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium. \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated subcutaneous administration and after single intravenous administration. The quantitative \n\ndetermination of anti-Xa and anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic \n\nmethods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after subcutaneous injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is \n\nclose to 100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous injection and \n\nachieves approximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single subcutaneous administration of \n\n2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, 100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous every \n\n12 hours provided initial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n = 16) and average exposure \n\ncorresponding to 88% of steady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once \n\ndaily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio \n\nabout 15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice daily regimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% \n\nhigher than after a single dose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and \n\n0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n149 \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated subcutaneous administration no \n\naccumulation takes place. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after subcutaneous administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa \n\nactivity. The mean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following \n\nsubcutaneous injection and reaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerisation to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour intravenous infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single subcutaneous dose to about \n\n7 hours after repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal.  However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\nclearance < 30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) intravenous dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n150 \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is \n\nmarginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese \n\ncontrol subjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-\n\nadjusted clearance in obese subjects with subcutaneous dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) dose, that anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and 27% higher in \n\nlow-weight men (< 57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week subcutaneous toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at 10 mg/kg/day in the \n\n26-week subcutaneous and intravenous toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at subcutaneous doses of enoxaparin sodium up to \n\n30 mg/kg/day did not reveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was \n\nfound to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at subcutaneous \n\ndoses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Do not \n\ntry to inject yourself if you have not been trained how to do so. If you are not sure what to do, talk to your \n\ndoctor or nurse immediately. \n\n \n\nBefore injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n- Check the expiry date on the medicine. Do not use if the date has passed. \n\n- Check the syringe is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear solution. If not, use another \n\nsyringe. \n\n- Do not use this medicine if you notice any change in the appearance of the product. \n\n- Make sure you know how much you are going to inject. \n\n- Check your abdomen to see if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin colour, swelling, \n\noozing or is still painful, if so talk to your doctor or nurse. \n\n- Decide where you are going to inject the medicine. Change the place where you inject each time \n\nfrom the right to the left side of your stomach. This medicine should be injected just under the skin \n\non your stomach, but not too near the belly button or any scar tissue (at least 5 cm away from these). \n\n- The pre-filled syringe is intended for single use only. \n\n \n\nInstructions on injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n1)  Wash your hands and the area that you will inject with soap and water. Dry them. \n\n2)  Sit or lie in a comfortable position so you are relaxed. Make sure you can see the place you are going \n\nto inject. A lounge chair, recliner, or bed propped up with pillows is ideal. \n\n3)  Choose an area on the right or left side of your stomach. This should be at least 5 cm away from \n\nyour belly button and out towards your sides. \n\n \n\nRemember: Do not inject yourself within 5 cm of your belly button or around existing scars or bruises. \n\nChange the place where you inject between the left and right sides of your stomach, depending on the area \n\nyou were last injected. \n\n \n\n4)  Carefully pull off the needle cap from the syringe. Throw away the cap. The syringe is pre-filled and \n\nready to use. \n\n\n\n \n\n152 \n\n \n\n \nDo not press on the plunger before injecting yourself to get rid of air bubbles. This can lead to a loss of the \n\nmedicine. Once you have removed the cap, do not allow the needle to touch anything. This is to make sure \n\nthe needle stays clean (sterile). \n\n \n\n5)  Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, gently pinch the \n\ncleaned area of your abdomen between your forefinger and thumb to make a fold in the skin. \n\n \n\nMake sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n\n \n\n6)  Hold the syringe so that the needle is pointing downwards (vertically at a 90º angle). Insert the full \n\nlength of the needle into the skin fold. \n\n \n \n\n7)  Press down on the plunger with your finger. This will send the medicine into the fatty tissue of the \n\nstomach.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains enoxaparin sodium 15,000 IU anti-Xa activity (equivalent to 150 mg) in \n\n1 mL water for injections. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a biological substance obtained by alkaline depolymerisation of heparin benzyl ester \n\nderived from porcine intestinal mucosa. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n\nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in \nparticular those undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility \n\nat increased risk of venous thromboembolism.  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to \nrequire thrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), \n\nin combination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to \nbe managed medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk \n\nsurgery.  \n\n\n\n \n\n157 \n\n \n\nIn moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of \n\n7-10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the \n\npatient no longer has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by subcutaneous injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there \n\nis a need for earlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high \n\nrisk patient waiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no \n\nlater than 12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis \nup to 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal or \npelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status \n\n(e.g. mobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered subcutaneously either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg \n\n(1.5 mg/kg) or as twice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by subcutaneous injection administered in combination with \n\nantiplatelet therapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until \n\nclinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral loading \n\ndose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of 75–325 mg/day \n\nlong-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose followed by 100 IU/kg \n\n\n\n \n\n158 \n\n \n\n(1 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two subcutaneous doses). Appropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg \n\nto 325 mg once daily) should be administered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The \n\nrecommended duration of treatment is 8 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When \n\nadministered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic \n\ntherapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last subcutaneous dose of enoxaparin sodium was given \n\nless than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last \n\nsubcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an \n\nintravenous bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below “renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥ 75 years of age, an initial intravenous bolus must not be \n\nused. Initiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneous injection every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU \n\n(75 mg) for each of the first two subcutaneous doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneous \n\ndosing for the remaining doses). For dosage in elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below \n\n“renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\nSevere renal impairment  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n\n< 15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease 2,000 IU (20 mg) subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of  DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\nNo intravenous initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\nModerate and mild renal impairment \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance \n\n30-50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring \n\nis advised. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n159 \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by subcutaneous \n\ninjection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately \nfollowed by a subcutaneous injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe pre-filled disposable syringe is ready for immediate use.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using ampoules or multiple-dose vials to \n\nassure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous injection technique \n\nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep subcutaneous injection.  \n\n \n\nThe air bubble should not be expelled from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when \n\nusing pre-filled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the \n\npatient’s body weight, the graduated pre-filled syringes should be used to reach the required volume by \n\ndiscarding the excess before injection. In some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the \n\ngraduations on the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. The injection \n\nsite should not be rubbed after administration. \n\n \n\nNote for the pre-filled syringes fitted with an automatic safety system: The safety system is triggered at the \n\nend of the injection (see instructions in section 6.6). \n\n \n\nIn case of self-administration, patient should be advised to follow instructions provided in the patient \n\ninformation leaflet included in the pack of this medicine. \n\n \n\nIntravenous (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only) \n\nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately followed \n\nby a subcutaneous injection.  \n\nFor intravenous injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an intravenous line. It should not be mixed or \n\nco-administered with other medications. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other \n\ndrugs, the intravenous access chosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of sodium chloride or \n\ndextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to clear \n\nthe port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely administered with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection or 5% dextrose in water. \n\n \n\nInitial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n160 \n\n \n\nAdditional bolus for PCI when last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \n\ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional intravenous bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be \n\nadministered if last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or 5% dextrose in water) as follows:  \n\n30 mL of solution should be withdrawn from the infusion bag with a syringe and discarded. The complete \n\ncontents of the 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe should be injected into the 20 mL \n\nremaining in the bag. The contents of the bag should be gently mixed. Then, the required volume of diluted \n\nsolution should be withdrawn with a syringe for administration into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below. It is recommended to prepare \n\nthe dilution immediately before use. \n\n \n\nVolume to be injected through intravenous line after dilution is completed at a concentration of \n\n300 IU (3 mg)/mL. \n\n \n\nWeight Required dose  \n\n30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nVolume to inject when diluted \n\nto a final concentration of  \n\n300 IU (3 mg)/mL \n\n[kg] IU [mg] [mL] \n\n45 1350 13.5 4.5 \n\n50 1500 15 5 \n\n55 1650 16.5 5.5 \n\n60 1800 18 6 \n\n65 1950 19.5 6.5 \n\n70 2100 21 7 \n\n75 2250 22.5 7.5 \n\n80 2400 24 8 \n\n85 2550 25.5 8.5 \n\n90 2700 27 9 \n\n95 2850 28.5 9.5 \n\n100 3000 30 10 \n\n105 3150 31.5 10.5 \n\n110 3300 33 11 \n\n115 3450 34.5 11.5 \n\n120 3600 36 12 \n\n125 3750 37.5 12.5 \n\n130 3900 39 13 \n\n135 4050 40.5 13.5 \n\n140 4200 42 14 \n\n145 4350 43.5 14.5 \n\n150 4500 45 15 \n\n \n\nArterial line injection \n\nIt is administered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit for the prevention of thrombus formation in the \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n161 \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \n\nClinical monitoring and laboratory tests [prothrombin time expressed as the International Normalized Ratio \n\n(INR)] must be intensified to monitor the effect of VKA. \n\nAs there is an interval before the VKA reaches its maximum effect, enoxaparin sodium therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a constant dose for as long as necessary in order to maintain the INR within the desired \n\ntherapeutic range for the indication in two successive tests. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a VKA, the VKA should be discontinued and the first dose of enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given when the INR has dropped below the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) \n\nFor patients currently receiving enoxaparin sodium, discontinue enoxaparin sodium and start the DOAC 0 to \n\n2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of enoxaparin sodium would be due as per \n\nDOAC label. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a DOAC, the first dose of enoxaparin sodium should be given at the time the \n\nnext DOAC dose would be taken. \n\n \n\nAdministration in spinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture  \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, careful neurological monitoring is recommended due to the risk of \n\nneuraxial haematomas (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nAt doses used for prophylaxis \n\nA puncture-free interval of at least 12 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin sodium at \n\nprophylactic doses and the needle or catheter placement. \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of at least 12 hours should be observed before removing the \n\ncatheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of puncture/catheter \n\nplacement or removal to at least 24 hours. \n\nThe 2 hours preoperative initiation of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) is not compatible with neuraxial \n\nanaesthesia. \n\n \n\nAt doses used for treatment \n\nA puncture-free interval of at least 24 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin sodium at \n\ncurative doses and the needle or catheter placement (see also section 4.3).  \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of 24 hours should be observed before removing the catheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of puncture/catheter \n\nplacement or removal to at least 48 hours. \n\nPatients receiving the twice daily doses (i.e. 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) twice daily or 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\ntwice-daily) should omit the second enoxaparin sodium dose to allow a sufficient delay before catheter \n\nplacement or removal.  \n\n \n\nAnti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial \n\nhematoma will be avoided.  \n\nLikewise, consider not using enoxaparin sodium until at least 4 hours after the spinal/epidural puncture or \n\nafter the catheter has been removed. The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n\n\n \n\n162 \n\n \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nGeneral \n\nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\nHistory of HIT (> 100 days) \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (> 100 days) of \n\nheparin-induced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in \n\nsuch a case must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative \n\ntreatments are considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \n\nMonitoring of platelet counts \n\nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medications affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n163 \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests \n\nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nSpinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \n\nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach \n\na sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance \n\n[15-30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nmore prolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\nSkin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \n\nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\nPercutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \n\nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium injection. If the \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than \n\n6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or \n\nhematoma formation. \n\n \n\nAcute infective endocarditis \n\nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after \n\na careful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n164 \n\n \n\nMechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which increases the \n\nrisk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological monitoring by \n\nanti-Xa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n\n< 15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLow weight \n\nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and low-weight men (< 57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nObese Patients \n\nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\n \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n165 \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\nLMWHs are biological medicinal products. In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n  \n\nSodium content \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended  \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \n\nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution \n\n \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\nOther medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products increasing potassium levels \n\nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n166 \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely. Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis following surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment \n\nof DVT with or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose once a day. In \n\nthe clinical studies for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hours, and in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI \n\nenoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nsubcutaneously every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see section 4.4 and 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\n Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \n\n Rare: Eosinophilia* \n\n Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Common: Allergic reaction \n\n\n\n \n\n167 \n\n \n\n Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees \nof neurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of \nnormality) \n\n Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury*  \n\n Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema  \n\n Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \n\n Rare: Alopecia* \n\n Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena \nhave been usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\n Injection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\n Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\n Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\n Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medications affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n\n\n \n\n168 \n\n \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical \n\npatients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage \nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and \n\ngastro-intestinal haemorrhage. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\nSystem Organ \n\nClass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical \n\npatients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombocytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\n \n\nVery common:    \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nCommon:  \n\nThrombocytosis\nβ\n \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nVery rare:     \n\nImmuno-allergic \n\nthrombo-\n\ncytopenia \nβ\n: Platelet increased > 400 G/L  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\n \n\nAccidental overdose with enoxaparin sodium after intravenous, extracorporeal or subcutaneous \n\nadministration may lead to haemorrhagic complications. Following oral administration of even large doses, it \n\nis unlikely that enoxaparin sodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow intravenous injection of protamine. The dose \n\nof protamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the \n\nanticoagulant effect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the \n\nprevious 8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be \n\nadministered if enoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n169 \n\n \n\nadministration, or if it has been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the \n\nenoxaparin sodium injection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses \n\nof protamine, the anti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about \n\n60%) (see the prescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\nExtended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \n\nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, \n\n179 patients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n = 90) once a day subcutaneously or to placebo (n = 89) for 3 weeks. The \n\nincidence of DVT during extended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to \n\nplacebo, no PE was reported. No major bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nAll Treated Extended Prophylaxis Patients 90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)*  18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n# \n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo = 0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo = 0.537 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n170 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously were \n\nrandomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n = 131) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously or to placebo (n = 131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during \n\nextended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE \n\n(enoxaparin sodium 21 [16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p = 0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium \n\n8 [6.1%] versus placebo 28 [21.4%]; p =< 0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the \n\nenoxaparin sodium and the placebo group. \n\n \n\nExtended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \n\nA double-blind, multicentre trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously) daily for 6 to 10 days \n\nand were then randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. \n\nBilateral venography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous \n\nthromboembolism occurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis \n\nfor four weeks after surgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of \n\nvenographically demonstrated thrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. \n\nThe rates of venous thromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n = 20) in the \n\nplacebo group and 4.8% (n = 8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p = 0.02. This difference persisted at three \n\nmonths [13.8% vs. 5.5% (n = 23 vs 9), p = 0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other \n\ncomplications during the double-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicentre, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day subcutaneously was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients \n\nwith severely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of < 10 meters for \n\n≤ 3 days). This study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥ 75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated. Treatment continued for \n\n6 to 14 days (median duration 7 days). When given at a dose of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day subcutaneously, \n\nenoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the incidence of VTE as compared to placebo.

A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were \n\ntreated. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to prothrombin time to achieve \n\nan INR of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin \n\ntherapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a \n\nminimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved.  Both enoxaparin sodium \n\nregimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous \n\nthromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nonce a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nEnoxaparin sodium  \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\ntwice a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nHeparin  \n\naPTT Adjusted \n\nIntravenous Therapy \n\nn (%) \n\nAll Treated DVT Patients \n\nwith or without PE \n\n298 (100) 312 (100) 290 (100) \n\nTotal VTE (%) 13 (4.4)* 9 (2.9)* 12 (4.1) \n\n DVT Only (%) 11 (3.7) 7 (2.2) 8 (2.8) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 9 (3.0) 6 (1.9) 7 (2.4) \n\n PE (%) 2 (0.7) 2 (0.6) 4 (1.4) \nVTE = venous thromboembolic event (DVT and/or PE) \n\n*The 95% Confidence Intervals for the treatment differences for total VTE were:  \n\n- enoxaparin sodium once a day versus heparin (-3.0 to 3.5)  \n\n- enoxaparin sodium every 12 hours versus heparin (-4.2 to 1.7). \n\n \n\nMajor bleeding were respectively 1.7% in the enoxaparin sodium 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once a day group, \n\n1.3% in the enoxaparin sodium 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice a day group and 2.1% in the heparin group. \n\n \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and non ST elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicentre study, 3,171 patients enrolled at the acute phase of unstable angina or non-Q-wave \n\nmyocardial infarction were randomized to receive in association with acetylsalicylic acid (100 to 325 mg \n\nonce daily), either subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours or intravenous \n\nunfractionated heparin adjusted based on aPTT. Patients had to be treated in hospital for a minimum of \n\n2 days and a maximum of 8 days, until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures or hospital \n\ndischarge. The patients had to be followed up to 30 days. In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium \n\nsignificantly reduced the combined incidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a \n\ndecrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk reduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined \n\nincidence was maintained after 30 days (from 23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the \n\nsubcutaneous injection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicentre study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus \n\na 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose followed by an subcutaneous injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nevery 12 hours or intravenous unfractionated heparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were \n\nalso treated with acetylsalicylic acid for a minimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was \n\nadjusted for severe renally impaired patients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The subcutaneous \n\ninjections of enoxaparin sodium were given until hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days \n\n(whichever came first). \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-40\n\n\n \n\n172 \n\n \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last \n\nsubcutaneous administration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, intravenous bolus of 30 IU/ kg \n\n(0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium, if the last subcutaneous administration given more than 8 hours before \n\nballoon inflation. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p < 0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p < 0.001). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p = 0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage \n\n(a measure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group \n\n(10.1%) as compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium. \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated subcutaneous administration and after single intravenous administration. The quantitative \n\ndetermination of anti-Xa and anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic \n\nmethods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after subcutaneous injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is \n\nclose to 100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous injection and \n\nachieves approximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single subcutaneous administration of \n\n2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, 100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n\n\n \n\n173 \n\n \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously every \n\n12 hours provided initial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n = 16) and average exposure \n\ncorresponding to 88% of steady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once \n\ndaily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio \n\nabout 15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice daily regimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% \n\nhigher than after a single dose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and \n\n0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated subcutaneous administration no \n\naccumulation takes place. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after subcutaneous administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa \n\nactivity. The mean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following \n\nsubcutaneous injection and reaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerisation to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour intravenous infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single subcutaneous dose to about \n\n7 hours after repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal.  However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n \n\n174 \n\n \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\nclearance < 30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) intravenous dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is \n\nmarginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese \n\ncontrol subjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-\n\nadjusted clearance in obese subjects with subcutaneous dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single- subcutaneous 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) dose, that anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (< 45 kg) and 27% higher in \n\nlow-weight men (< 57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week subcutaneous toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at 10 mg/kg/day in the \n\n26-week subcutaneous and intravenous toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at subcutaneous doses of enoxaparin sodium up to \n\n30 mg/kg/day did not reveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was \n\nfound to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at subcutaneous \n\ndoses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Do not \n\ntry to inject yourself if you have not been trained how to do so. If you are not sure what to do, talk to your \n\ndoctor or nurse immediately. \n\n \n\nBefore injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n- Check the expiry date on the medicine. Do not use if the date has passed. \n\n- Check the syringe is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear solution. If not, use another \n\nsyringe. \n\n- Do not use this medicine if you notice any change in the appearance of the product. \n\n- Make sure you know how much you are going to inject. \n\n- Check your abdomen to see if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin colour, swelling, \n\noozing or is still painful, if so talk to your doctor or nurse. \n\n- Decide where you are going to inject the medicine. Change the place where you inject each time \n\nfrom the right to the left side of your stomach. This medicine should be injected just under the skin \n\non your stomach, but not too near the belly button or any scar tissue (at least 5 cm away from these). \n\n- The pre-filled syringe is intended for single use only. \n\n \n\nInstructions on injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n1)  Wash your hands and the area that you will inject with soap and water. Dry them. \n\n2)  Sit or lie in a comfortable position so you are relaxed. Make sure you can see the place you are going \n\nto inject. A lounge chair, recliner, or bed propped up with pillows is ideal. \n\n3)  Choose an area on the right or left side of your stomach. This should be at least 5 cm away from \n\nyour belly button and out towards your sides. \n\n\n\n \n\n176 \n\n \n\n \n\nRemember: Do not inject yourself within 5 cm of your belly button or around existing scars or bruises. \n\nChange the place where you inject between the left and right sides of your stomach, depending on the area \n\nyou were last injected. \n\n \n\n4)  Carefully pull off the needle cap from the syringe. Throw away the cap. The syringe is pre-filled and \n\nready to use. \n\n \nDo not press on the plunger before injecting yourself to get rid of air bubbles. This can lead to a loss of the \n\nmedicine. Once you have removed the cap, do not allow the needle to touch anything. This is to make sure \n\nthe needle stays clean (sterile). \n\n \n\n5)  Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, gently pinch the \n\ncleaned area of your abdomen between your forefinger and thumb to make a fold in the skin. \n\n \n\nMake sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n\n \n\n6)  Hold the syringe so that the needle is pointing downwards (vertically at a 90º angle). Insert the full \n\nlength of the needle into the skin fold. \n\n \n \n\n7)  Press down on the plunger with your finger. This will send the medicine into the fatty tissue of the \n\nstomach. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n\n \n\n8)  Remove the needle by pulling it straight out. \n\n \nTo avoid bruising, do not rub the injection site after you have injected yourself. \n \n\n9)  Drop the used syringe into the sharps container. Close the container lid tightly and place the \n\ncontainer out of reach of children. \n\n \n\nWhen the container is full, dispose of it as your doctor or pharmacist has instructed. Do not put it in \n\nthe household rubbish. \n\n\n\n \n\n177 \n\n \n\n \n\nHow to give yourself an injection of Inhixa \n\nYour pre-filled syringe has a needle guard attached to it in order to protect you from needle stick injury. \n\nIf you are able to give this medicine to yourself, your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \n\nInhixa 30,000 IU (300 mg)/3 mL solution for injection in multidose vial \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nOne vial contains enoxaparin sodium 30,000 IU anti-Xa activity (equivalent to 300 mg) in 3.0 mL water for \n\ninjections. \n\n \n\nEach mL contains 10,000 IU (100 mg) enoxaparin sodium. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a biological substance obtained by alkaline depolymerisation of heparin benzyl ester \n\nderived from porcine intestinal mucosa. \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect \n\n \n\nBenzyl alcohol (45 mg in 3.0 mL) \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection in multidose vial \n\nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in \nparticular those undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility \n\nat increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to \nrequire thrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), \n\nin combination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to \nbe managed medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n181 \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk \n\nsurgery.  \n\nIn moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of \n\n7-10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the \n\npatient no longer has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by subcutaneous injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there \n\nis a need for earlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high \n\nrisk patient waiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no \n\nlater than 12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis up \nto 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal or \npelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status \n\n(e.g. mobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered subcutaneously either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg (1.5 \n\nmg/kg) or as twice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n182 \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by subcutaneous injection administered in combination with \n\nantiplatelet therapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until \n\nclinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral loading \n\ndose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of 75-325 mg/day \n\nlong-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose followed by 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two subcutaneous doses). Appropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg \n\nto 325 mg once daily) should be administered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The \n\nrecommended duration of treatment is 8 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When \n\nadministered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic \n\ntherapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last subcutaneous dose of enoxaparin sodium was given \n\nless than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last \n\nsubcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an \n\nintravenous bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below paragraph “Renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥75 years of age, an initial intravenous bolus must not be \n\nused. Initiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU \n\n(75 mg) for each of the first two subcutaneous doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneous \n\ndosing for the remaining doses). For dosage in elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below \n\n“renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\nSevere renal impairment  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n\n<15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\n \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease 2,000 IU (20 mg) subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg \n\n\n\n \n\n183 \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\nNo intravenous initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\n \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\nModerate and mild renal impairment \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance \n\n30-50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring \n\nis advised. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nInhixa multidose vial contains benzyl alcohol and must not be used in newborn and premature neonates \n\n(see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by subcutaneous \n\ninjection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately \nfollowed by a subcutaneous injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using multiple-dose vials to assure \n\nwithdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous injection technique \n\nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep subcutaneous injection.  \n\n \n\nThe air bubble should not be expelled from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when \n\nusing pre-filled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the \n\npatient’s body weight, the graduated pre-filled syringes should be use to reach the required volume by \n\ndiscarding the excess before injection. In some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the \n\ngraduations on the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. The injection \n\nsite should not be rubbed after administration. \n\n \n\nIntravenous (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only) \n\nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately followed \n\nby a subcutaneous injection.  \n\nFor intravenous injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\n\n\n \n\n184 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an intravenous line. It should not be mixed or co-\n\nadministered with other medicinal products. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other \n\ndrugs, the intravenous access chosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n\n(0.9%) solution for infusion or glucose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration \n\nof enoxaparin sodium to clear the port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely administered with sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or 5% glucose in water for injections. \n\n \n\nInitial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\nAdditional bolus for PCI when last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \n\ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional intravenous bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be \n\nadministered if last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either normal sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \n\nsolution for infusion or 5% glucose in water for injections) as follows:  \n\n30 mL of the solution should be withdrawn from the infusion bag with a syringe and discarded. The \n\ncomplete contents of the 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe should be injected into the \n\n20 mL remaining in the bag. The contents of the bag should be gently mixed. Then, the required volume of \n\ndiluted solution should be withdrawn with a syringe for administration into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below. It is recommended to prepare \n\nthe dilution immediately before use. \n\n \n\nVolume to be injected through intravenous line after dilution is completed at a concentration of 300 IU \n\n(3 mg)/mL. \n\n \n\nWeight \nRequired dose \n\n30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nVolume to inject when diluted to a final \n\nconcentration of 300 IU (3 mg)/mL \n\n[kg] IU [mg] [mL] \n\n45 1,350 13.5 4.5 \n\n50 1,500 15 5 \n\n55 1,650 16.5 5.5 \n\n60 1,800 18 6 \n\n65 1,950 19.5 6.5 \n\n70 2,100 21 7 \n\n75 2,250 22.5 7.5 \n\n80 2,400 24 8 \n\n85 2,550 25.5 8.5 \n\n90 2,700 27 9 \n\n95 2,850 28.5 9.5 \n\n100 3,000 30 10 \n\n105 3,150 31.5 10.5 \n\n110 3,300 33 11 \n\n115 3,450 34.5 11.5 \n\n120 3,600 36 12 \n\n125 3,750 37.5 12.5 \n\n130 3,900 39 13 \n\n135 4,050 40.5 13.5 \n\n\n\n \n\n185 \n\n \n\n140 4,200 42 14 \n\n145 4,350 43.5 14.5 \n\n150 4,500 45 15 \n\n \n\nArterial line injection \n\nIt is administered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit for the prevention of thrombus formation in the \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \n\nClinical monitoring and laboratory tests [prothrombin time expressed as the International Normalised Ratio \n\n(INR)] must be intensified to monitor the effect of VKA. \n\nAs there is an interval before the VKA reaches its maximum effect, enoxaparin sodium therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a constant dose for as long as necessary in order to maintain the INR within the desired \n\ntherapeutic range for the indication in two successive tests. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a VKA, the VKA should be discontinued and the first dose of enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given when the INR has dropped below the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) \n\nFor patients currently receiving enoxaparin sodium, discontinue enoxaparin sodium and start the DOAC 0 to \n\n2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of enoxaparin sodium would be due as per \n\nDOAC label. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a DOAC, the first dose of enoxaparin sodium should be given at the time the \n\nnext DOAC dose would be taken. \n\n \n\nAdministration in spinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture  \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, careful neurological monitoring is recommended due to the risk of \n\nneuraxial haematomas (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nAt doses used for prophylaxis \n\nA puncture-free interval of at least 12 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin sodium at \n\nprophylactic doses and the needle or catheter placement. \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of at least 12 hours should be observed before removing the \n\ncatheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of puncture/catheter \n\nplacement or removal to at least 24 hours. \n\nThe 2 hours preoperative initiation of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) is not compatible with neuraxial \n\nanaesthesia. \n\n \n\nAt doses used for treatment \n\nA puncture-free interval of at least 24 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin sodium at \n\ncurative doses and the needle or catheter placement (see also section 4.3).  \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of 24 hours should be observed before removing the catheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of puncture/catheter \n\nplacement or removal to at least 48 hours. \n\nPatients receiving the twice daily doses (i.e. 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) twice daily or 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\ntwice-daily) should omit the second enoxaparin sodium dose to allow a sufficient delay before catheter \n\nplacement or removal.  \n\nAnti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial \n\nhematoma will be avoided.  \n\nLikewise, consider not using enoxaparin sodium until at least 4 hours after the spinal/epidural puncture or \n\nafter the catheter has been removed. The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n186 \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH), to benzyl alcohol or any other of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\nBecause of the content of benzyl alcohol (see section 6.1), enoxaparin sodium multiple dose vial formulation \n\nmust not be given to newborns or premature neonates (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\nHistory of HIT (>100 days) \n\n \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (>100 days) of heparin-\n\ninduced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such \n\na case must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments \n\nare considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \n\nMonitoring of platelet counts \n\n \n\nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\n\n\n \n\n187 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests \n\n \n\nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nSpinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \n\n \n\nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach \n\na sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance \n\n[15-30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nmore prolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\nSkin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \n\n \n\nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\nPercutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \n\n \n\nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\n\n\n \n\n188 \n\n \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/ subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium injection. If the \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than \n\n6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or \n\nhematoma formation. \n\n \n\nAcute infective endocarditis \n\n \n\nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after \n\na careful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\nMechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\n \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg ) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\n In patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which \nincreases the risk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological \n\nmonitoring by anti-Xa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n Enoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n<15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n189 \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLow weight \n\n \n\nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (<45 kg) and low-weight men (<57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nObese Patients \n\n \n\nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\n \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\n \n\nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nLMWHs are biological medicinal products. In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n  \n\nBenzyl alcohol \n\n \n\nBenzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n\nIntravenous administration of benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in \n\nneonates (“Gasping Syndrome”) (see section 4.3). The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity \n\nmay occur is not known. Benzyl alcohol may also cause toxic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years \n\nold, due to increased risk of accumulation. \n\nHigh volumes of medicinal products containing benzyl alcohol should be used with caution and only if \n\nnecessary in patients with liver or kidney impairment, or in pregnant women, because of the risk of \n\naccumulation of benzyl alcohol and its toxicity (metabolic acidosis). \n\n \n\nSodium \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose within the recommended dose \n\nrange, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \n\nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n\n\n \n\n190 \n\n \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution \n\n \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\nOther medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products increasing potassium levels \n\nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAs benzyl alcohol may cross the placenta, it is recommended to use a formulation that does not contain \n\nbenzyl alcohol. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely. Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n191 \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis following surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment \n\nof DVT with or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose once a day. In \n\nthe clinical studies for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hours, and in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI \n\nenoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nsubcutaneously every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see sections 4.4 and ”Description of selected adverse reactions” below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\n Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \n\n Rare: Eosinophilia* \n\n Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Common: Allergic reaction \n\n Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees \nof neurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of \nnormality) \n\n Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury *  \n\n Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\n\n\n \n\n192 \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema  \n\n Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \n\n Rare: Alopecia* \n\n Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena \nhave been usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\nInjection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \n\nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\n Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\n Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\n Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSystem \n\norgan \n\nclass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nRare: \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and gastro-intestinal \n\nhaemorrhage. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n193 \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\nSystem \n\norgan \n\nclass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombo- \n\ncytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombo- \n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombocytosis\nβ\n \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nVery rare: \n\nImmuno-allergic \n\nthrombo-\n\ncytopenia \nβ\n: Platelet increased >400 G/L  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIntravenous administration of benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in \n\nneonates (“Gasping Syndrome”) (see section 4.3). \n\nBenzyl alcohol may also cause toxic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old, due to increased risk \n\nof accumulation (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\n \n\nAccidental overdose with enoxaparin sodium after intravenous, extracorporeal or subcutaneous \n\nadministration may lead to haemorrhagic complications. Following oral administration of even large doses, it \n\nis unlikely that enoxaparin sodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow intravenous injection of protamine. The dose \n\nof protamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the \n\nanticoagulant effect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the \n\nprevious 8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be \n\nadministered if enoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine \n\nadministration, or if it has been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the \n\nenoxaparin sodium injection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses \n\nof protamine, the anti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about \n\n60%) (see the prescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n194 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\nExtended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \n\nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, \n\n179 patients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=90) once a day subcutaneously or to placebo (n=89) for 3 weeks. The incidence \n\nof DVT during extended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo, no \n\nPE was reported. No major bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day subcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nAll treated extended prophylaxis patients 90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE (%) 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)* 18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n#\n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo =0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo =0.537 \n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously were \n\nrandomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=131) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously or to placebo (n=131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during \n\nextended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n195 \n\n \n\n(enoxaparin sodium 21 [16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p=0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium \n\n8 [6.1%] versus placebo 28 [21.4%]; p=<0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the \n\nenoxaparin sodium and the placebo group. \n\n \n\nExtended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \n\nA double-blind, multicentre trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously) daily for 6 to 10 days \n\nand were then randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. \n\nBilateral venography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous \n\nthromboembolism occurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis \n\nfor four weeks after surgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of \n\nvenographically demonstrated thrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. \n\nThe rates of venous thromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n=20) in the \n\nplacebo group and 4.8% (n=8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p=0.02. This difference persisted at three \n\nmonths [13.8% vs. 5.5% (n=23 vs 9), p=0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other \n\ncomplications during the double-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicentre, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day subcutaneously was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients \n\nwith severely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of <10 meters for \n\n≤3 days). This study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated. Treatment continued for \n\n6 to 14 days (median duration 7 days). When given at a dose of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day subcutaneously, \n\nenoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the incidence of VTE as compared to placebo. The efficacy data are \n\nprovided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n2,000 IU (20 mg) \n\nonce a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nEnoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg)  \n\nonce a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nn (%) \n\nAll treated medical patients \n\nduring acute illness \n\n287 (100) 291(100) 288 (100) \n\nTotal VTE (%) 43 (15.0) 16 (5.5)* 43 (14.9) \n\n Total DVT (%) 43 (15.0) 16 (5.5) 40 (13.9) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 13 (4.5) 5 (1.7) 14 (4.9) \nVTE = Venous thromboembolic events which included DVT, PE, and death considered to be thromboembolic in origin \n\n* p value versus placebo = 0.0002 \n\n \n\nAt approximately 3 months following enrolment, the incidence of VTE remained significantly lower in the \n\nenoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) treatment group versus the placebo treatment group. \n\nThe occurrence of total and major bleeding were respectively 8.6% and 1.1% in the placebo group, 11.7% \n\nand 0.3% in the enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) group and 12.6% and 1.7% in the enoxaparin sodium \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) group. \n\n \n\nTreatment of deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism  \n\nIn a multicentre, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity DVT with or without PE were \n\nrandomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once \n\na day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours subcutaneously, or \n\n(iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5,000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an \n\n\n\n \n\n196 \n\n \n\naPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were \n\ntreated. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to prothrombin time to achieve \n\nan INR of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin \n\ntherapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a \n\nminimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium \n\nregimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous \n\nthromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nonce a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nEnoxaparin sodium  \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\ntwice a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nHeparin  \n\naPTT Adjusted Intravenous \n\nTherapy \n\nn (%) \n\nAll treated DVT patients \n\nwith or without PE \n\n298 (100) 312 (100) 290 (100) \n\nTotal VTE (%) 13 (4.4)* 9 (2.9)* 12 (4.1) \n\n DVT only (%) 11 (3.7) 7 (2.2) 8 (2.8) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 9 (3.0) 6 (1.9) 7 (2.4) \n\n PE (%) 2 (0.7) 2 (0.6) 4 (1.4) \n\nVTE = venous thromboembolic event (DVT and/or PE) \n\n* The 95% Confidence Intervals for the treatment differences for total VTE were:  \n\n- enoxaparin sodium once a day versus heparin (-3.0 to 3.5)  \n- enoxaparin sodium every 12 hours versus heparin (-4.2 to 1.7). \n\n \n\nMajor bleeding were respectively 1.7% in the enoxaparin sodium 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once a day group, \n\n1.3% in the enoxaparin sodium 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice a day group and 2.1% in the heparin group. \n\n \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and non ST elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicentre study, 3,171 patients enrolled at the acute phase of unstable angina or non-Q-wave \n\nmyocardial infarction were randomized to receive in association with acetylsalicylic acid (100 to 325 mg \n\nonce daily), either subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours or intravenous \n\nunfractionated heparin adjusted based on aPTT. Patients had to be treated in hospital for a minimum of \n\n2 days and a maximum of 8 days, until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures or hospital \n\ndischarge. The patients had to be followed up to 30 days. In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium \n\nsignificantly reduced the combined incidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a \n\ndecrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk reduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined \n\nincidence was maintained after 30 days (from 23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the \n\nsubcutaneous injection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicentre study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus \n\na 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously dose followed by an subcutaneous injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nevery 12 hours or intravenous unfractionated heparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were \n\nalso treated with acetylsalicylic acid for a minimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was \n\nadjusted for severe renally impaired patients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The subcutaneous \n\ninjections of enoxaparin sodium were given until hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days \n\n(whichever came first). \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last \n\nsubcutaneous administration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, intravenous bolus of 30 IU/ kg \n\n(0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium, if the last subcutaneous administration given more than 8 hours before \n\nballoon inflation. \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-40\n\n\n \n\n197 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p<0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p<0.001). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p=0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage \n\n(a measure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group \n\n(10.1%) as compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium. \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated subcutaneous administration and after single intravenous administration. The quantitative \n\ndetermination of anti-Xa and anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic \n\nmethods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after subcutaneous injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is \n\nclose to 100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous injection and \n\nachieves approximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single subcutaneous administration of \n\n2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, 100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous every \n\n12 hours provided initial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure \n\ncorresponding to 88% of steady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n198 \n\n \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once \n\ndaily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio \n\nabout 15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice daily regimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% \n\nhigher than after a single dose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and \n\n0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated subcutaneous administration no \n\naccumulation takes place. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after subcutaneous administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa \n\nactivity. The mean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following \n\nsubcutaneous injection and reaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerisation to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour intravenous infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single subcutaneous dose to about \n\n7 hours after repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal.  However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\n\n\n \n\n199 \n\n \n\nclearance <30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) intravenous dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is \n\nmarginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese \n\ncontrol subjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-\n\nadjusted clearance in obese subjects with subcutaneous dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single- subcutaneous 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) dose, that anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-\n\nweight men (<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week subcutaneous toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at  10 mg/kg/day in the \n\n26-week subcutaneous and intravenous toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at subcutaneous doses of enoxaparin sodium up to \n\n30 mg/kg/day did not reveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was \n\nfound to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at subcutaneous \n\ndoses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in \nparticular those undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility \n\nat increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to \nrequire thrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), \n\nin combination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to \nbe managed medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n203 \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk \n\nsurgery.  \n\n In moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of \n7-10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the \n\npatient no longer has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by subcutaneous injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there \n\nis a need for earlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high \n\nrisk patient waiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no \n\nlater than 12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis up \nto 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal or \npelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status \n\n(e.g. mobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered subcutaneously either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg \n\n(1.5 mg/kg) or as twice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n204 \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by subcutaneous injection administered in combination with \n\nantiplatelet therapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until \n\nclinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\n Acetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral \nloading dose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of \n\n75-325 mg/day long-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose followed by 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two subcutaneous doses). Appropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg \n\nto 325 mg once daily) should be administered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The \n\nrecommended duration of treatment is 8 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When \n\nadministered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic \n\ntherapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last subcutaneous dose of enoxaparin sodium was given \n\nless than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last \n\nsubcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an \n\nintravenous bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below paragraph “Renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥75 years of age, an initial intravenous bolus must not be \n\nused. Initiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU \n\n(75 mg) for each of the first two subcutaneous doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneous \n\ndosing for the remaining doses). For dosage in elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below \n\n“renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\nSevere renal impairment  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n\n<15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\n \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease 2,000 IU (20 mg) subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of  DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\n\n\n \n\n205 \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n \n\nNo intravenous initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\n \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\nModerate and mild renal impairment \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance \n\n30-50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring \n\nis advised. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established.  \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nInhixa multidose vial contains benzyl alcohol and must not be used in newborn and premature neonates \n\n(see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by subcutaneous \n\ninjection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately \nfollowed by a subcutaneous injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using multiple-dose vials to assure \n\nwithdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous injection technique \n\nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep subcutaneous injection.  \n\n \n\nThe air bubble should not be expelled from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when \n\nusing pre-filled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the \n\npatient’s body weight, the graduated pre-filled syringes should be used to reach the required volume by \n\ndiscarding the excess before injection. In some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the \n\ngraduations on the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. The injection \n\nsite should not be rubbed after administration. \n\n \n\nIntravenous (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only) \n\nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately followed \n\nby a subcutaneous injection.  \n\nFor intravenous injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\n\n\n \n\n206 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an intravenous line. It should not be mixed or co-\n\nadministered with other medicinal products. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other \n\ndrugs, the intravenous access chosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n\n(0.9%) solution for infusion or glucose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration \n\nof enoxaparin sodium to clear the port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely administered with sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or 5% glucose in water for injections. \n\n \n\nInitial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\nAdditional bolus for PCI when last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \n\ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional intravenous bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be \n\nadministered if last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either normal sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \n\nsolution for infusion or 5% glucose in water for injections) as follows:  \n\n30 mL of the solution should be withdrawn from the infusion bag with a syringe and discarded. The \n\ncomplete contents of the 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe should be injected into the \n\n20 mL remaining in the bag. The contents of the bag should be gently mixed. Then, the required volume of \n\ndiluted solution should be withdrawn with a syringe for administration into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below. It is recommended to prepare \n\nthe dilution immediately before use. \n\n \n\nVolume to be injected through intravenous line after dilution is completed at a concentration of 300 IU (3 \n\nmg)/mL. \n\n \n\nWeight \nRequired dose \n\n30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) \n\nVolume to inject when diluted to \n\na final concentration of \n\n300 IU (3 mg)/mL \n\n[kg] IU [mg] [mL] \n\n45 1,350 13.5 4.5 \n\n50 1,500 15 5 \n\n55 1,650 16.5 5.5 \n\n60 1,800 18 6 \n\n65 1,950 19.5 6.5 \n\n70 2,100 21 7 \n\n75 2,250 22.5 7.5 \n\n80 2,400 24 8 \n\n85 2,550 25.5 8.5 \n\n90 2,700 27 9 \n\n95 2,850 28.5 9.5 \n\n100 3,000 30 10 \n\n105 3,150 31.5 10.5 \n\n110 3,300 33 11 \n\n115 3,450 34.5 11.5 \n\n120 3,600 36 12 \n\n125 3,750 37.5 12.5 \n\n130 3,900 39 13 \n\n\n\n \n\n207 \n\n \n\n135 4,050 40.5 13.5 \n\n140 4,200 42 14 \n\n145 4,350 43.5 14.5 \n\n150 4,500 45 15 \n\n \n\nArterial line injection \n\nIt is administered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit for the prevention of thrombus formation in the \n\nextra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and vitamin K antagonists (VKA)  \n\nClinical monitoring and laboratory tests [prothrombin time expressed as the International Normalised Ratio \n\n(INR)] must be intensified to monitor the effect of VKA. \n\nAs there is an interval before the VKA reaches its maximum effect, enoxaparin sodium therapy should be \n\ncontinued at a constant dose for as long as necessary in order to maintain the INR within the desired \n\ntherapeutic range for the indication in two successive tests. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a VKA, the VKA should be discontinued and the first dose of enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given when the INR has dropped below the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nSwitch between enoxaparin sodium and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) \n\nFor patients currently receiving enoxaparin sodium, discontinue enoxaparin sodium and start the DOAC 0 to \n\n2 hours before the time that the next scheduled administration of enoxaparin sodium would be due as per \n\nDOAC label. \n\nFor patients currently receiving a DOAC, the first dose of enoxaparin sodium should be given at the time the \n\nnext DOAC dose would be taken. \n\n \n\nAdministration in spinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture  \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, careful neurological monitoring is recommended due to the risk of \n\nneuraxial haematomas (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nAt doses used for prophylaxis \n\nA puncture-free interval of at least 12 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin sodium at \n\nprophylactic doses and the needle or catheter placement. \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of at least 12 hours should be observed before removing the \n\ncatheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of puncture/catheter \n\nplacement or removal to at least 24 hours. \n\nThe 2 hours preoperative initiation of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) is not compatible with neuraxial \n\nanaesthesia. \n\n \n\nAt doses used for treatment \n\nA puncture-free interval of at least 24 hours shall be kept between the last injection of enoxaparin sodium at \n\ncurative doses and the needle or catheter placement (see also section 4.3).  \n\nFor continuous techniques, a similar delay of 24 hours should be observed before removing the catheter.  \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min, consider doubling the timing of puncture/catheter \n\nplacement or removal to at least 48 hours. \n\nPatients receiving the twice daily doses (i.e. 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) twice daily or 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\ntwice-daily) should omit the second enoxaparin sodium dose to allow a sufficient delay before catheter \n\nplacement or removal.  \n\nAnti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial \n\nhematoma will be avoided.  \n\nLikewise, consider not using enoxaparin sodium until at least 4 hours after the spinal/epidural puncture or \n\nafter the catheter has been removed. The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n208 \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH), to benzyl alcohol or any other of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\nBecause of the content of benzyl alcohol (see section 6.1), enoxaparin sodium multiple dose vial formulation \n\nmust not be given to newborns or premature neonates (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\nHistory of HIT (>100 days) \n\n \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (>100 days) of heparin-\n\ninduced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such \n\na case must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments \n\nare considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \n\nMonitoring of platelet counts \n\n \n\nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\n\n\n \n\n209 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests \n\n \n\nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nSpinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \n\n \n\nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach \n\na sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance \n\n[15-30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nmore prolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\nSkin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \n\n \n\nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\nPercutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \n\n \n\nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\n\n\n \n\n210 \n\n \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/ subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium injection. If the \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than \n\n6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or \n\nhematoma formation. \n\n \n\nAcute infective endocarditis \n\n \n\nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after \n\na careful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\nMechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\n \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg ) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\n In patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which \nincreases the risk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological \n\nmonitoring by anti-Xa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n Enoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n<15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n211 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLow weight \n\n \n\nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (<45 kg) and low-weight men (<57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nObese Patients \n\n \n\nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\n \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\n \n\nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nLMWHs are biological medicinal products In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n  \n\nBenzyl alcohol \n\n \n\nBenzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n\nIntravenous administration of benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in \n\nneonates (“Gasping Syndrome”) (see section 4.3). The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity \n\nmay occur is not known. Benzyl alcohol may also cause toxic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years \n\nold, due to increased risk of accumulation. \n\nHigh volumes of medicinal products containing benzyl alcohol should be used with caution and only if \n\nnecessary in patients with liver or kidney impairment, or in pregnant women, because of the risk of \n\naccumulation of benzyl alcohol and its toxicity (metabolic acidosis). \n\n \n\nSodium \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose within the recommended dose \n\nrange, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \n\nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n212 \n\n \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution \n\n \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\nOther medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n\n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n \n\nMedicinal products increasing potassium levels \n\nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAs benzyl alcohol may cross the placenta, it is recommended to use a formulation that does not contain \n\nbenzyl alcohol. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely. Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\n\n\n \n\n213 \n\n \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis following surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment \n\nof DVT with or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose once a day. In \n\nthe clinical studies for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hours, and in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI \n\nenoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nsubcutaneously every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see sections 4.4 and “Description of selected adverse reactions” below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\no Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \no Rare: Eosinophilia* \no Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \n\ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\no Common: Allergic reaction \no Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\no Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\no Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees \nof neurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\no Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of \nnormality) \n\no Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury *  \no Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\no Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema \no Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \no Rare: Alopecia* \no Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena \n\nhave been usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\n\n\n \n\n214 \n\n \n\n Injection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\no Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\no Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\no Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\no Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSystem \n\norgan \n\nclass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common:  \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nRare:  \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon:  \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nRare:  \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon:  \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon:  \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and gastro-intestinal \n\nhaemorrhage. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\nSystem \n\norgan \n\nclass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common:  \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon:  \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon:  \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombo-cytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon:  \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nCommon:   \n\nThrombocytosis\nβ\n \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nVery rare:     \n\nImmuno-allergic \n\nthrombo-\n\ncytopenia \nβ\n: Platelet increased >400 G/L  \n\n\n\n \n\n215 \n\n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIntravenous administration of benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in \n\nneonates (“Gasping Syndrome”) (see section 4.3). \n\nBenzyl alcohol may also cause toxic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old, due to increased risk \n\nof accumulation (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\n \n\nAccidental overdose with enoxaparin sodium after intravenous, extracorporeal or subcutaneous \n\nadministration may lead to haemorrhagic complications. Following oral administration of even large doses, it \n\nis unlikely that enoxaparin sodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow intravenous injection of protamine. The dose \n\nof protamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the \n\nanticoagulant effect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the \n\nprevious 8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be \n\nadministered if enoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine \n\nadministration, or if it has been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the \n\nenoxaparin sodium injection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses \n\nof protamine, the anti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about \n\n60%) (see the prescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n216 \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\nExtended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \n\nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, \n\n179 patients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=90) once a day subcutaneously or to placebo (n=89) for 3 weeks. The incidence \n\nof DVT during extended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo, no \n\nPE was reported. No major bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day subcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nAll treated extended prophylaxis patients 90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE (%) 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)* 18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n#\n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo =0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo =0.537 \n\n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously were \n\nrandomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=131) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously or to placebo (n=131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during \n\nextended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE \n\n(enoxaparin sodium 21 [16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p=0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium \n\n8 [6.1%] versus placebo 28 [21.4%]; p=<0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the \n\nenoxaparin sodium and the placebo group. \n\n \n\nExtended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \n\nA double-blind, multicentre trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously) daily for 6 to 10 days \n\nand were then randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. \n\nBilateral venography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous \n\nthromboembolism occurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis \n\nfor four weeks after surgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of \n\nvenographically demonstrated thrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. \n\nThe rates of venous thromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n=20) in the \n\nplacebo group and 4.8% (n=8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p=0.02. This difference persisted at three \n\nmonths [13.8% vs. 5.5% (n=23 vs 9), p=0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other \n\ncomplications during the double-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n217 \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicentre, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day subcutaneously was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients \n\nwith severely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of <10 meters for \n\n≤3 days). This study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated. Treatment continued for \n\n6 to 14 days (median duration 7 days). When given at a dose of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day subcutaneously, \n\nenoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the incidence of VTE as compared to placebo.

A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were \n\ntreated. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to prothrombin time to achieve \n\nan INR of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin \n\ntherapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a \n\nminimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium \n\nregimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous \n\nthromboembolism (DVT and/or PE).

Patients had to be treated in hospital for a minimum of \n\n2 days and a maximum of 8 days, until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures or hospital \n\ndischarge. The patients had to be followed up to 30 days. In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium \n\nsignificantly reduced the combined incidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a \n\ndecrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk reduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined \n\nincidence was maintained after 30 days (from 23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the \n\nsubcutaneous injection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicentre study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus a \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose followed by an subcutaneous injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every \n\n12 hours or intravenous unfractionated heparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were also \n\ntreated with acetylsalicylic acid for a minimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was \n\nadjusted for severe renally impaired patients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The subcutaneous \n\ninjections of enoxaparin sodium were given until hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days \n\n(whichever came first). \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last \n\nsubcutaneous administration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, intravenous bolus of 30 IU/ kg \n\n(0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium, if the last subcutaneous administration given more than 8 hours before \n\nballoon inflation. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p<0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p<0.001). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p=0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage \n\n(a measure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group \n\n(10.1%) as compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium. \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\n\n\n \n\n219 \n\n \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated subcutaneous administration and after single intravenous administration. The quantitative \n\ndetermination of anti-Xa and anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic \n\nmethods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after subcutaneous injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is \n\nclose to 100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous injection and \n\nachieves approximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single subcutaneous administration of \n\n2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, 100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously every \n\n12 hours provided initial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure \n\ncorresponding to 88% of steady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once \n\ndaily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio \n\nabout 15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice daily regimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% \n\nhigher than after a single dose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and \n\n0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated subcutaneous administration no \n\naccumulation takes place. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after subcutaneous administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa \n\nactivity. The mean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following \n\nsubcutaneous injection and reaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n220 \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerisation to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour intravenous infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single subcutaneous dose to about \n\n7 hours after repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal. However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\nclearance <30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) intravenous dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is \n\nmarginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese \n\ncontrol subjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-\n\nadjusted clearance in obese subjects with subcutaneous dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) dose, that anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-\n\nweight men (<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n221 \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week subcutaneous toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at  10 mg/kg/day in the \n\n26-week subcutaneous and intravenous toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at subcutaneous doses of enoxaparin sodium up to \n\n30 mg/kg/day did not reveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was \n\nfound to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at subcutaneous \n\ndoses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInhixa is indicated in adults for:  \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients, in \nparticular those undergoing orthopaedic or general surgery including cancer surgery. \n\n Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness (such as acute \nheart failure, respiratory insufficiency, severe infections or rheumatic diseases) and reduced mobility \n\nat increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  \n\n Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), excluding PE likely to \nrequire thrombolytic therapy or surgery. \n\n Prevention of thrombus formation in extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n Acute coronary syndrome:  \n- Treatment of unstable angina and Non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), \n\nin combination with oral acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n- Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) including patients to \nbe managed medically or with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n224 \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in moderate and high risk surgical patients \n\nIndividual thromboembolic risk for patients can be estimated using validated risk stratification model. \n\n In patients at moderate risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n2,000 IU (20 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection. Preoperative initiation (2 hours before \n\nsurgery) of enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) was proven effective and safe in moderate risk \n\nsurgery.  \n\n In moderate risk patients, enoxaparin sodium treatment should be maintained for a minimal period of \n7-10 days whatever the recovery status (e.g. mobility). Prophylaxis should be continued until the \n\npatient no longer has significantly reduced mobility. \n\n In patients at high risk of thromboembolism, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU \n(40 mg) once daily given by subcutaneous injection preferably started 12 hours before surgery. If there \n\nis a need for earlier than 12 hours enoxaparin sodium preoperative prophylactic initiation (e.g. high \n\nrisk patient waiting for a deferred orthopaedic surgery), the last injection should be administered no \n\nlater than 12 hours prior to surgery and resumed 12 hours after surgery. \n\no For patients who undergo major orthopaedic surgery an extended thromboprophylaxis up \nto 5 weeks is recommended.  \n\no For patients with a high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk who undergo abdominal or \npelvic surgery for cancer an extended thromboprophylaxis up to 4 weeks is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients \n\nThe recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily by subcutaneous injection.  \n\nTreatment with enoxaparin sodium is prescribed for at least 6 to 14 days whatever the recovery status \n\n(e.g. mobility). The benefit is not established for a treatment longer than 14 days. \n\n \n\nTreatment of DVT and PE \n\nEnoxaparin sodium can be administered subcutaneously either as a once daily injection of 150 IU/kg \n\n(1.5 mg/kg) or as twice daily injections of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg). \n\nThe regimen should be selected by the physician based on an individual assessment including evaluation of \n\nthe thromboembolic risk and of the risk of bleeding. The dose regimen of 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) \n\nadministered once daily should be used in uncomplicated patients with low risk of VTE recurrence. The dose \n\nregimen of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) administered twice daily should be used in all other patients such as those \n\nwith obesity, with symptomatic PE, cancer, recurrent VTE or proximal (vena iliaca) thrombosis. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium treatment is prescribed for an average period of 10 days. Oral anticoagulant therapy \n\nshould be initiated when appropriate (see “Switch between enoxaparin sodium and oral anticoagulants” at \n\nthe end of section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of thrombus formation during haemodialysis  \n\nThe recommended dose is 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nFor patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, the dose should be reduced to 50 IU/kg (0.5 mg/kg) for double \n\nvascular access or 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) for single vascular access.  \n\n \n\nDuring haemodialysis, enoxaparin sodium should be introduced into the arterial line of the circuit at the \n\nbeginning of the dialysis session. The effect of this dose is usually sufficient for a 4-hour session; however, if \n\nfibrin rings are found, for example after a longer than normal session, a further dose of 50 IU to 100 IU/kg \n\n(0.5 to 1 mg/kg) may be given. \n\n \n\nNo data are available in patients using enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis or treatment and during \n\nhaemodialysis sessions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n225 \n\n \n\nAcute coronary syndrome: treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI and treatment of acute STEMI \n\n For treatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is \n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours by subcutaneous injection administered in combination with \n\nantiplatelet therapy. Treatment should be maintained for a minimum of 2 days and continued until \n\nclinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days.  \n\n Acetylsalicylic acid is recommended for all patients without contraindications at an initial oral \nloading dose of 150–300 mg (in acetylsalicylic acid-naive patients) and a maintenance dose of \n\n75-325 mg/day long-term regardless of treatment strategy. \n\n For treatment of acute STEMI, the recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous \nbolus of 3,000 IU (30 mg) plus a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose followed by 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 10,000 IU (100 mg) for each of the \n\nfirst two subcutaneous doses). Appropriate antiplatelet therapy such as oral acetylsalicylic acid (75 mg \n\n  to 325 mg once daily) should be administered concomitantly unless contraindicated. The \nrecommended duration of treatment is 8 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. When \n\nadministered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non-fibrin specific), enoxaparin \n\nsodium should be given between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic \n\ntherapy. \n\no For dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age, see paragraph “Elderly”. \no For patients managed with PCI, if the last subcutaneous dose of enoxaparin sodium was given \n\nless than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last \n\nsubcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, an \n\nintravenous bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium should be administered. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nFor all indications except STEMI, no dose reduction is necessary in the elderly patients, unless kidney \n\nfunction is impaired (see below paragraph “Renal impairment” and section 4.4). \n\nFor treatment of acute STEMI in elderly patients ≥75 years of age, an initial intravenous bolus must not be \n\nused. Initiate dosing with 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 7,500 IU \n\n(75 mg) for each of the first two subcutaneous doses only, followed by 75 IU/kg (0.75 mg/kg) subcutaneous \n\ndosing for the remaining doses). For dosage in elderly patients with impaired kidney function, see below \n\n“renal impairment” and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nLimited data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 and 5.2) and caution should \n\nbe used in these patients (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2) \n\nSevere renal impairment  \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n\n<15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nDosage table for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [15-30] mL/min): \n\n \n\nIndication Dosing regimen \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease 2,000 IU (20 mg) subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of  DVT and PE 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI  100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously once daily \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients under 75) \n\n \n\n \n\n1 x 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) body weight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\n\n\n \n\n226 \n\n \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute STEMI (patients over 75) \n\n \n\nNo intravenous initial bolus, 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously and then 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) body \n\nweight subcutaneously every 24 hours \n\n \n\nThe recommended dosage adjustments do not apply to the haemodialysis indication. \n\n \n\nModerate and mild renal impairment \n\nAlthough no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance \n\n30-50 mL/min) and mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment, careful clinical monitoring \n\nis advised. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in paediatric population have not been established.  \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nInhixa multidose vial contains benzyl alcohol and must not be used in newborn and premature neonates \n\n(see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nInhixa should not be administered by the intramuscular route. \n\n \n\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease following surgery, treatment of DVT and PE, \n\ntreatment of unstable angina and NSTEMI, enoxaparin sodium should be administered by subcutaneous \n\ninjection. \n\n For acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately \nfollowed by a subcutaneous injection. \n\n For the prevention of thrombus formation in the extra corporeal circulation during haemodialysis, it is \nadministered through the arterial line of a dialysis circuit.  \n\n \n\nThe use of a tuberculin syringe or equivalent is recommended when using multiple-dose vials to assure \n\nwithdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous injection technique \n\nInjection should be made preferably when the patient is lying down. Enoxaparin sodium is administered by \n\ndeep subcutaneous injection.  \n\n \n\nThe air bubble should not be expelled from the syringe before the injection to avoid the loss of drug when \n\nusing pre-filled syringes. When the quantity of drug to be injected requires to be adjusted based on the \n\npatient’s body weight, the graduated pre-filled syringes should be used to reach the required volume by \n\ndiscarding the excess before injection. In some cases it is not possible to achieve an exact dose due to the \n\ngraduations on the syringe, and in such case the volume shall be rounded up to the nearest graduation.  \n\n \n\nThe administration should be alternated between the left and right anterolateral or posterolateral abdominal \n\nwall. \n\n \n\nThe whole length of the needle should be introduced vertically into a skin fold gently held between the \n\nthumb and index finger. The skin fold should not be released until the injection is complete. The injection \n\nsite should not be rubbed after administration. \n\n \n\nIntravenous (bolus) injection (for acute STEMI indication only) \n\nFor acute STEMI, treatment is to be initiated with a single intravenous bolus injection immediately followed \n\nby a subcutaneous injection.  \n\nFor intravenous injection, either the multidose vial or pre-filled syringe can be used. \n\n\n\n \n\n227 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be administered through an intravenous line. It should not be mixed or co-\n\nadministered with other medicinal products. To avoid the possible mixture of enoxaparin sodium with other \n\ndrugs, the intravenous access chosen should be flushed with a sufficient amount of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n\n(0.9%) solution for infusion or glucose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration \n\nof enoxaparin sodium to clear the port of drug. Enoxaparin sodium may be safely administered with sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or 5% glucose in water for injections. \n\n \n\nInitial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus \n\nFor the initial 3,000 IU (30 mg) bolus, using an enoxaparin sodium graduated pre-filled syringe, expel the \n\nexcessive volume to retain only 3,000 IU (30 mg) in the syringe. The 3,000 IU (30 mg) dose can then be \n\ndirectly injected into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\nAdditional bolus for PCI when last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon \n\ninflation \n\nFor patients being managed with PCI, an additional intravenous bolus of 30 IU/kg (0.3 mg/kg) is to be \n\nadministered if last subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation. \n\n \n\nIn order to assure the accuracy of the small volume to be injected, it is recommended to dilute the drug to \n\n300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL). \n\nTo obtain a 300 IU/mL (3 mg/mL) solution, using a 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe, \n\nit is recommended to use a 50 mL infusion bag (i.e. using either normal sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \n\nsolution for infusion or 5% glucose in water for injections) as follows:  \n\n30 mL of the solution should be withdrawn from the infusion bag with a syringe and discarded. The \n\ncomplete contents of the 6,000 IU (60 mg) enoxaparin sodium pre-filled syringe should be injected into the \n\n20 mL remaining in the bag. The contents of the bag should be gently mixed. Then, the required volume of \n\ndiluted solution should be withdrawn with a syringe for administration into the intravenous line. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution is completed, the volume to be injected can be calculated using the following formula [Volume \n\nof diluted solution (mL) = Patient weight (kg) x 0.1] or using the table below.

The delay must be based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both \n\nthe risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n229 \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n Hypersensitivity to enoxaparin sodium, heparin or its derivatives, including other low molecular \nweight heparins (LMWH), to benzyl alcohol or any other of the excipients listed in section 6.1; \n\n History of immune mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) within the past 100 days or in \nthe presence of circulating antibodies (see also section 4.4 ); \n\n Active clinically significant bleeding and conditions with a high risk of haemorrhage, including recent \nhaemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal ulcer, presence of malignant neoplasm at high risk of bleeding, \n\nrecent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous \n\nmalformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities; \n\n Spinal or epidural anaesthesia or loco-regional anaesthesia when enoxaparin sodium is used for \ntreatment in the previous 24 hours (see section 4.4). \n\nBecause of the content of benzyl alcohol (see section 6.1), enoxaparin sodium multiple dose vial formulation \n\nmust not be given to newborns or premature neonates (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with other LMWHs. These medicinal \n\nproducts differ in their manufacturing process, molecular weights, specific anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, \n\nunits, dosage and clinical efficacy and safety. This results in differences in pharmacokinetics and associated \n\nbiological activities (e.g. anti-thrombin activity, and platelet interactions). Special attention and compliance \n\nwith the instructions for use specific to each proprietary medicinal product are therefore required.  \n\n \n\nHistory of HIT (>100 days) \n\n \n\nUse of enoxaparin sodium in patients with a history of immune mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in \n\nthe presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Circulating antibodies may persist \n\nseveral years. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is to be used with extreme caution in patients with a history (>100 days) of heparin-\n\ninduced thrombocytopenia without circulating antibodies. The decision to use enoxaparin sodium in such \n\na case must be made only after a careful benefit risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments \n\nare considered (e.g. danaparoid sodium or lepirudin). \n\n \n\nMonitoring of platelet counts \n\n \n\nThe risk of antibody-mediated HIT also exists with LMWHs. Should thrombocytopenia occur, it usually \n\nappears between the 5\nth\n and the 21\n\nst\n day following the beginning of enoxaparin sodium treatment.  \n\nThe risk of HIT is higher in postoperative patients and mainly after cardiac surgery and in patients with \n\ncancer. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended that the platelet counts be measured before the initiation of therapy with \n\nenoxaparin sodium and then regularly thereafter during the treatment. \n\nIf there are clinical symptoms suggestive of HIT (any new episode of arterial and/or venous \n\nthromboembolism, any painful skin lesion at the injection site, any allergic or anaphylactoid reactions on \n\ntreatment), platelet count should be measured. Patients must be aware that these symptoms may occur and if \n\nso, that they should inform their primary care physician. \n\nIn practice, if a confirmed significant decrease of the platelet count is observed (30 to 50 % of the initial \n\nvalue), enoxaparin sodium treatment must be immediately discontinued and the patient switched to another \n\nnon-heparin anticoagulant alternative treatment. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, bleeding may occur at any site. If bleeding occurs, the origin of the \n\nhaemorrhage should be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted.  \n\n\n\n \n\n230 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium, as with any other anticoagulant therapy, should be used with caution in conditions with \n\nincreased potential for bleeding, such as: \n\n- impaired haemostasis,  \n- history of peptic ulcer, \n- recent ischemic stroke,  \n- severe arterial hypertension,  \n- recent diabetic retinopathy, \n- neuro- or ophthalmologic surgery, \n- concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests \n\n \n\nAt doses used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding \n\ntime and global blood coagulation tests significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of \n\nfibrinogen to platelets. \n\nAt higher doses, increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT) \n\nmay occur. Increases in aPTT and ACT are not linearly correlated with increasing enoxaparin sodium \n\nantithrombotic activity and therefore are unsuitable and unreliable for monitoring enoxaparin sodium \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nSpinal/Epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture \n\n \n\nSpinal/epidural anaesthesia or lumbar puncture must not be performed within 24 hours of administration of \n\nenoxaparin sodium at therapeutic doses (see also section 4.3). \n\nThere have been cases of neuraxial haematomas reported with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nspinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture procedures resulting in long term or permanent paralysis. \n\nThese events are rare with enoxaparin sodium dosage regimens 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily or lower. The \n\nrisk of these events is higher with the use of post-operative indwelling epidural catheters, with the \n\nconcomitant use of additional drugs affecting haemostasis such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal \n\nsurgery or spinal deformity. \n\n \n\nTo reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and \n\nepidural or spinal anaesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of \n\nenoxaparin sodium (see section 5.2). Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best \n\nperformed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin sodium is low; however, the exact timing to reach \n\na sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. For patients with creatinine clearance \n\n[15-30 mL/minute], additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nmore prolonged (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nShould the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal \n\nanaesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and \n\nsymptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or \n\nweakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they \n\nexperience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, \n\ninitiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though \n\nsuch treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.   \n\n \n\nSkin necrosis / cutaneous vasculitis \n\n \n\nSkin necrosis and cutaneous vasculitis have been reported with LMWHs and should lead to prompt treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\nPercutaneous coronary revascularization procedures \n\n \n\nTo minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable \n\nangina, NSTEMI and acute STEMI, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin \n\n\n\n \n\n231 \n\n \n\nsodium injection doses. It is important to achieve haemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure \n\ndevice is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath \n\nshould be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/ subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium injection. If the \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than \n\n6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or \n\nhematoma formation. \n\n \n\nAcute infective endocarditis \n\n \n\nUse of heparin is usually not recommended in patients with acute infective endocarditis due to the risk of \n\ncerebral haemorrhage.  If such use is considered absolutely necessary, the decision must be made only after \n\na careful individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\nMechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\n \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium has not been adequately studied for thromboprophylaxis in patients with \n\nmechanical prosthetic heart valves. Isolated cases of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis have been reported in \n\npatients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who have received enoxaparin sodium for \n\nthromboprophylaxis. Confounding factors, including underlying disease and insufficient clinical data, limit \n\nthe evaluation of these cases. Some of these cases were pregnant women in whom thrombosis led to maternal \n\nand foetal death.  \n\n \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves \n\nThe use of enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart \n\nvalves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic \n\nheart valves given enoxaparin sodium (100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg ) twice daily) to reduce the risk of \n\nthromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal \n\nand foetal death. There have been isolated post-marketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women \n\nwith mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin sodium for thromboprophylaxis. \n\nPregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nNo increased bleeding tendency is observed in the elderly with the prophylactic dosage ranges. Elderly \n\npatients (especially patients eighty years of age and older) may be at an increased risk for bleeding \n\ncomplications with the therapeutic dosage ranges. Careful clinical monitoring is advised and dose reduction \n\nmight be considered in patients older than 75 years treated for STEMI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\n In patients with renal impairment, there is an increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium which \nincreases the risk of bleeding. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is advised, and biological \n\nmonitoring by anti-Xa activity measurement might be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n Enoxaparin sodium is not recommended for patients with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance \n<15 mL/min) due to lack of data in this population outside the prevention of thrombus formation in extra \n\ncorporeal circulation during haemodialysis. \n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min), since exposure of enoxaparin \n\nsodium is significantly increased, a dosage adjustment is recommended for therapeutic and prophylactic \n\ndosage ranges (see section 4.2).  \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) and \n\nmild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n232 \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased \n\npotential for bleeding. Dose adjustment based on monitoring of anti-Xa levels is unreliable in patients with \n\nliver cirrhosis and not recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLow weight \n\n \n\nAn increase in exposure of enoxaparin sodium with prophylactic dosages (non-weight adjusted) has been \n\nobserved in low-weight women (<45 kg) and low-weight men (<57 kg), which may lead to a higher risk of \n\nbleeding. Therefore, careful clinical monitoring is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nObese Patients \n\n \n\nObese patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of prophylactic doses in \n\nobese patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) has not been fully determined and there is no consensus for dose \n\nadjustment. These patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\n \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\n \n\nHeparins can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalaemia (see section 4.8), \n\nparticularly in patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic \n\nacidosis, taking medicinal products known to increase potassium (see section 4.5). Plasma potassium should \n\nbe monitored regularly especially in patients at risk. \n\n  \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nLMWHs are biological medicinal products. In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal \n\nproducts, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded . \n\n \n\nBenzyl alcohol \n\n \n\nBenzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n\nIntravenous administration of benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in \n\nneonates (“Gasping Syndrome”) (see section 4.3). The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity \n\nmay occur is not known. Benzyl alcohol may also cause toxic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years \n\nold, due to increased risk of accumulation. \n\nHigh volumes of medicinal products containing benzyl alcohol should be used with caution and only if \n\nnecessary in patients with liver or kidney impairment, or in pregnant women, because of the risk of \n\naccumulation of benzyl alcohol and its toxicity (metabolic acidosis). \n\n \n\nSodium \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose within the recommended dose \n\nrange, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nConcomitant use not recommended \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4) \n\nIt is recommended that some agents which affect haemostasis should be discontinued prior to enoxaparin \n\nsodium therapy unless strictly indicated. If the combination is indicated, enoxaparin sodium should be used \n\nwith careful clinical and laboratory monitoring when appropriate. These agents include medicinal products \n\nsuch as: \n\n- Systemic salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory doses, and NSAIDs including \nketorolac, \n\n- Other thrombolytics (e.g. alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, urokinase) and \nanticoagulants (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n233 \n\n \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with caution \n\n \n\nThe following medicinal products may be administered with caution concomitantly with enoxaparin sodium: \n\nOther medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as: \n\n- Platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid used at antiaggregant dose \n(cardioprotection), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists indicated in \n\nacute coronary syndrome due to the risk of bleeding, \n\n- Dextran 40,  \n\n- Systemic glucocorticoids. \n \n\nMedicinal products increasing potassium levels \n\nMedicinal products that increase serum potassium levels may be administered concurrently with enoxaparin \n\nsodium under careful clinical and laboratory monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nIn humans, there is no evidence that enoxaparin crosses the placental barrier during the second and third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy. There is no information available concerning the first trimester.  \n\nAnimal studies have not shown any evidence of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Animal data \n\nhave shown that enoxaparin passage through the placenta is minimal. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium should be used during pregnancy only if the physician has established a clear need. \n\nPregnant women receiving enoxaparin sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or \n\nexcessive anticoagulation and should be warned of the haemorrhagic risk. Overall, the data suggest that there \n\nis no evidence for an increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis with respect to the \n\nrisk observed in non-pregnant women, other than that observed in pregnant women with prosthetic heart \n\nvalves (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIf an epidural anaesthesia is planned, it is recommended to withdraw enoxaparin sodium treatment before \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAs benzyl alcohol may cross the placenta, it is recommended to use a formulation that does not contain \n\nbenzyl alcohol. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether unchanged enoxaparin is excreted in human breast milk. In lactating rats, the \n\npassage of enoxaparin or its metabolites in milk is very low. The oral absorption of enoxaparin sodium is \n\nunlikely. Inhixa can be used during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data for enoxaparin sodium in fertility. Animal studies did not show any effect on \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has been evaluated in more than 15,000 patients who received enoxaparin sodium in \n\nclinical trials. These included 1,776 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following orthopaedic or \n\n\n\n \n\n234 \n\n \n\nabdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,169 for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, 559 for treatment of DVT with or \n\nwithout PE, 1,578 for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and 10,176 for \n\ntreatment of acute STEMI.  \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium regimen administered during these clinical trials varies depending on indications. The \n\nenoxaparin sodium dose was 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously once daily for prophylaxis of deep vein \n\nthrombosis following surgery or in acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility. In treatment \n\nof DVT with or without PE, patients receiving enoxaparin sodium were treated with either a 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose every 12 hours or a 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose once a day. In \n\nthe clinical studies for treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, doses were \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hours, and in the clinical study for treatment of acute STEMI \n\nenoxaparin sodium regimen was a 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus followed by 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) \n\nsubcutaneously every 12 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were the most commonly reported \n\nreactions (see sections 4.4 and “Description of selected adverse reactions” below). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nOther adverse reactions observed in clinical studies and reported in post-marketing experience (* indicates \n\nreactions from post-marketing experience) are detailed below.  \n\nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from available data). Within each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \n\no Common: Haemorrhage, haemorrhagic anaemia*, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis \no Rare: Eosinophilia* \no Rare: Cases of immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia with thrombosis; in some of them thrombosis was \n\ncomplicated by organ infarction or limb ischaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\no Common: Allergic reaction \no Rare: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid reactions including shock* \n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\no Common: Headache* \n \n\nVascular disorders \n\no Rare: Spinal haematoma* (or neuraxial haematoma). These reactions have resulted in varying degrees \nof neurologic injuries including long-term or permanent paralysis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\no Very common: Hepatic enzyme increases (mainly transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of \nnormality) \n\no Uncommon: Hepatocellular liver injury *  \no Rare: Cholestatic liver injury* \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\no Common: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema \no Uncommon: Bullous dermatitis \no Rare: Alopecia* \no Rare: Cutaneous vasculitis*, skin necrosis* usually occurring at the injection site (these phenomena \n\nhave been usually preceded by purpura or erythematous plaques, infiltrated and painful). \n\n\n\n \n\n235 \n\n \n\n Injection site nodules* (inflammatory nodules, which were not cystic enclosure of enoxaparin). They \nresolve after a few days and should not cause treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \n\no Rare: Osteoporosis* following long term therapy (greater than 3 months) \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\no Common: Injection site haematoma, injection site pain, other injection site reaction (such as oedema, \nhaemorrhage, hypersensitivity, inflammation, mass, pain, or reaction)  \n\no Uncommon: Local irritation, skin necrosis at injection site \n \n\nInvestigations \n\no Rare: Hyperkalaemia* (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHaemorrhages \n\nThese included major haemorrhages, reported at most in 4.2 % of the patients (surgical patients). Some of \n\nthese cases have been fatal. In surgical patients, haemorrhage complications were considered major: (1) if the \n\nhaemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by haemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or \n\ntransfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial haemorrhages were always \n\nconsidered major.  \n\nAs with other anticoagulants, haemorrhage may occur in the presence of associated risk factors such as: \n\norganic lesions liable to bleed, invasive procedures or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting \n\nhaemostasis (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nSystem \n\norgan \n\nclass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common:  \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nRare:  \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon: \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n  \n\nVery common: \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon: \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon:  \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nRare:  \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nCommon:  \n\nHaemorrhage\nα\n \n\n \n\nUncommon:  \n\nIntracranial \n\nhaemorrhage, \n\nRetroperitoneal \n\nhaemorrhage \nα\n: such as haematoma, ecchymosis other than at injection site, wound haematoma, haematuria, epistaxis and gastro-intestinal \n\nhaemorrhage. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis \n\nSystem \n\norgan \n\nclass \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nsurgical patients \n\nProphylaxis in \n\nmedical patients \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nDVT with or \n\nwithout PE \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nunstable angina \n\nand non-Q-wave \n\nMI \n\nTreatment in \n\npatients with \n\nacute STEMI  \n\nBlood \n\nand \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common:  \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon:  \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon:  \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nVery common: \n\nThrombo-cytosis\nβ\n \n\n \n\nCommon: \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nUncommon:  \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nCommon:   \n\nThrombocytosis\nβ\n \n\nThrombo-\n\ncytopenia \n\nVery rare:     \n\nImmuno-allergic \n\nthrombo-\n\ncytopenia \nβ\n: Platelet increased >400 G/L  \n\n\n\n \n\n236 \n\n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of enoxaparin sodium in children have not been established (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIntravenous administration of benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in \n\nneonates (“Gasping Syndrome”) (see section 4.3). \n\nBenzyl alcohol may also cause toxic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old, due to increased risk \n\nof accumulation (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

Following oral administration of even large doses, it \n\nis unlikely that enoxaparin sodium will be absorbed. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nThe anticoagulant effects can be largely neutralized by the slow intravenous injection of protamine. The dose \n\nof protamine depends on the dose of enoxaparin sodium injected; 1 mg protamine neutralizes the \n\nanticoagulant effect of 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium, if enoxaparin sodium was administered in the \n\nprevious 8 hours. An infusion of 0.5 mg protamine per 100 IU (1 mg) of enoxaparin sodium may be \n\nadministered if enoxaparin sodium was administered greater than 8 hours previous to the protamine \n\nadministration, or if it has been determined that a second dose of protamine is required. After 12 hours of the \n\nenoxaparin sodium injection, protamine administration may not be required. However, even with high doses \n\nof protamine, the anti-Xa activity of enoxaparin sodium is never completely neutralized (maximum about \n\n60%) (see the prescribing information for protamine salts). \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, heparin group. ATC code: B01A B05 \n\n \n\nInhixa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \n\nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin is a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of approximately 4,500 daltons, in which the \n\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of standard heparin have been dissociated. The drug substance is \n\nthe sodium salt.  \n\n \n\nIn the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti-Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) \n\nand low anti-IIa or anti thrombin activity (approximately 28 IU/mg), with a ratio of 3.6. These anticoagulant \n\nactivities are mediated through anti-thrombin III (ATIII) resulting in anti-thrombotic activities in humans. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n237 \n\n \n\nBeyond its anti-Xa/IIa activity, further antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of enoxaparin have \n\nbeen identified in healthy subjects and patients as well as in non-clinical models. \n\nThese include ATIII-dependent inhibition of other coagulation factors like factor VIIa, induction of \n\nendogenous Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) release as well as a reduced release of von Willebrand \n\nfactor (vWF) from the vascular endothelium into the blood circulation. These factors are known to contribute \n\nto the overall antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin sodium. \n\nWhen used as prophylactic treatment, enoxaparin sodium does not significantly affect the aPTT. When used \n\nas curative treatment, aPTT can be prolonged by 1.5-2.2 times the control time at peak activity. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nPrevention of venous thromboembolic disease associated with surgery \n\nExtended prophylaxis of VTE following orthopaedic surgery  \n\nIn a double blind study of extended prophylaxis for patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, \n\n179 patients with no venous thromboembolic disease initially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously, were randomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin \n\nsodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=90) once a day subcutaneously or to placebo (n=89) for 3 weeks. The incidence \n\nof DVT during extended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo, no \n\nPE was reported. No major bleeding occurred. \n\nThe efficacy data are provided in the table below. \n\n \n\n Enoxaparin sodium  \n\n4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nPlacebo  \n\nonce a day subcutaneously \n\nn (%) \n\nAll treated extended prophylaxis patients 90 (100) 89 (100) \n\nTotal VTE (%) 6 (6.6) 18 (20.2) \n\n Total DVT (%) 6 (6.6)* 18 (20.2) \n\n Proximal DVT (%) 5 (5.6)\n#\n 7 (8.8) \n\n*p value versus placebo =0.008 \n\n#p value versus placebo =0.537 \n\n \n\nIn a second double-blind study, 262 patients without VTE disease and undergoing hip replacement surgery \n\ninitially treated, while hospitalized, with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously were \n\nrandomized to a post-discharge regimen of either enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) (n=131) once a day \n\nsubcutaneously or to placebo (n=131) for 3 weeks. Similar to the first study the incidence of VTE during \n\nextended prophylaxis was significantly lower for enoxaparin sodium compared to placebo for both total VTE \n\n(enoxaparin sodium 21 [16%] versus placebo 45 [34.4%]; p=0.001) and proximal DVT (enoxaparin sodium \n\n8 [6.1%] versus placebo 28 [21.4%]; p=<0.001). No difference in major bleeding was found between the \n\nenoxaparin sodium and the placebo group. \n\n \n\nExtended prophylaxis of DVT following cancer surgery \n\nA double-blind, multicentre trial, compared a four-week and a one-week regimen of enoxaparin sodium \n\nprophylaxis in terms of safety and efficacy in 332 patients undergoing elective surgery for abdominal or \n\npelvic cancer. Patients received enoxaparin sodium (4,000 IU (40 mg) subcutaneously) daily for 6 to 10 days \n\nand were then randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin sodium or placebo for another 21 days. \n\nBilateral venography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous \n\nthromboembolism occurred. The patients were followed for three months. Enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis \n\nfor four weeks after surgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer significantly reduced the incidence of \n\nvenographically demonstrated thrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin sodium prophylaxis for one week. \n\nThe rates of venous thromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 % (n=20) in the \n\nplacebo group and 4.8% (n=8) in the enoxaparin sodium group; p=0.02. This difference persisted at three \n\nmonths [13.8% vs. 5.5% (n=23 vs 9), p=0.01]. There were no differences in the rates of bleeding or other \n\ncomplications during the double-blind or follow-up periods. \n\n \n\nhttp://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=de6fb917-a94a-41ea-9d7d-937d4080ffcd&audience=consumer#footnote-32\n\n\n \n\n238 \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients with an acute illness expected to induce \n\nlimitation of mobility \n\nIn a double blind multicentre, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 2,000 IU (20 mg) or 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) once a day subcutaneously was compared to placebo in the prophylaxis of DVT in medical patients \n\nwith severely restricted mobility during acute illness (defined as walking distance of <10 meters for \n\n≤3 days). This study included patients with heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV); acute respiratory failure or \n\ncomplicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, and acute infection or acute rheumatic; if associated with at \n\nleast one VTE risk factor (age ≥75 years, cancer, previous VTE, obesity, varicose veins, hormone therapy, \n\nand chronic heart or respiratory failure). \n\nA total of 1,102 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1,073 patients were treated. Treatment continued for \n\n6 to 14 days (median duration 7 days). When given at a dose of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once a day subcutaneously, \n\nenoxaparin sodium significantly reduced the incidence of VTE as compared to placebo.

A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were \n\ntreated. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to prothrombin time to achieve \n\nan INR of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin \n\ntherapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a \n\nminimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium \n\nregimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous \n\nthromboembolism (DVT and/or PE).

Patients had to be treated in hospital for a minimum of \n\n2 days and a maximum of 8 days, until clinical stabilization, revascularization procedures or hospital \n\ndischarge. The patients had to be followed up to 30 days. In comparison with heparin, enoxaparin sodium \n\nsignificantly reduced the combined incidence of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and death, with a \n\ndecrease of 19.8 to 16.6% (relative risk reduction of 16.2%) on day 14. This reduction in the combined \n\nincidence was maintained after 30 days (from 23.3 to 19.8%; relative risk reduction of 15%). \n\nThere were no significant differences in major haemorrhages, although a haemorrhage at the site of the \n\nsubcutaneous injection was more frequent. \n\n \n\nTreatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction \n\nIn a large multicentre study, 20,479 patients with STEMI eligible to receive fibrinolytic therapy were \n\nrandomized to receive either enoxaparin sodium in a single 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus plus a \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneous dose followed by an subcutaneous injection of 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) every \n\n12 hours or intravenous unfractionated heparin adjusted based on aPTT for 48 hours. All patients were also \n\ntreated with acetylsalicylic acid for a minimum of 30 days. The enoxaparin sodium dosing strategy was \n\nadjusted for severe renally impaired patients and for the elderly of at least 75 years of age. The subcutaneous \n\ninjections of enoxaparin sodium were given until hospital discharge or for a maximum of eight days \n\n(whichever came first). \n\n4,716 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention receiving antithrombotic support with blinded \n\nstudy drug. Therefore, for patients on enoxaparin sodium, the PCI was to be performed on enoxaparin \n\nsodium (no switch) using the regimen established in previous studies i.e. no additional dosing, if last \n\nsubcutaneous administration given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, intravenous bolus of 30 IU/ kg \n\n(0.3 mg/kg) enoxaparin sodium, if the last subcutaneous administration given more than 8 hours before \n\nballoon inflation. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium compared to unfractionated heparin significantly decreased the incidence of  the primary \n\nend point, a composite of death from any cause or myocardial re-infarction in the first 30 days after \n\nrandomization [9.9 percent in the enoxaparin sodium group, as compared with 12.0 percent in the \n\nunfractionated heparin group] with a 17 percent relative risk reduction (p<0.001). \n\nThe treatment benefits of enoxaparin sodium, evident for a number of efficacy outcomes, emerged at \n\n48 hours, at which time there was a 35 percent reduction in the relative risk of myocardial re-infarction, as \n\ncompared with treatment with unfractionated heparin (p<0.001). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point was consistent across key subgroups \n\nincluding age, gender, infarct location, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, type of \n\nfibrinolytic administered, and time to treatment with study drug. \n\nThere was a significant treatment benefit of enoxaparin sodium, as compared with unfractionated heparin, in \n\npatients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention within 30 days after randomization (23 percent \n\nreduction in relative risk) or who were treated medically (15 percent reduction in relative risk, p=0.27 for \n\ninteraction). \n\nThe rate of the 30 day composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or intracranial haemorrhage \n\n(a measure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium group \n\n(10.1%) as compared to the heparin group (12.2%), representing a 17% relative risk reduction in favour of \n\ntreatment with enoxaparin sodium. \n\nThe incidence of major bleeding at 30 days was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the enoxaparin sodium \n\ngroup (2.1%) versus the heparin group (1.4%). There was a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in \n\n\n\n \n\n240 \n\n \n\nthe enoxaparin sodium group (0.5%) versus the heparin group (0.1%), while the incidence of intracranial \n\nhaemorrhage was similar in both groups (0.8% with enoxaparin sodium versus 0.7% with heparin). \n\nThe beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary end point observed during the first 30 days was \n\nmaintained over a 12 month follow-up period. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBased on literature data the use of enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) in cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh \n\nclass B-C) appears to be safe and effective in preventing portal vein thrombosis. It should be noted that the \n\nliterature studies may have limitations. Caution should be used in patients with hepatic impairment as these \n\npatients have an increased potential for bleeding (see section 4.4) and no formal dose finding studies have \n\nbeen performed in cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh class A, B nor C). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral characteristics \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxaparin sodium have been studied primarily in terms of the time \n\ncourse of plasma anti-Xa activity and also by anti-IIa activity, at the recommended dosage ranges after single \n\nand repeated subcutaneous administration and after single intravenous administration. The quantitative \n\ndetermination of anti-Xa and anti-IIa pharmacokinetic activities was conducted by validated amidolytic \n\nmethods. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe absolute bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium after subcutaneous injection, based on anti-Xa activity, is \n\nclose to 100%. \n\n \n\nDifferent doses and formulations and dosing regimens can be used. \n\nThe mean maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is observed 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous injection and \n\nachieves approximately 0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.3 anti-Xa IU/mL following single subcutaneous administration of \n\n2,000 IU, 4,000 IU, 100 IU/kg and 150 IU/kg (20 mg, 40 mg, 1 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) doses, respectively. \n\n \n\nA 3,000 IU (30 mg) intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously every \n\n12 hours provided initial maximum anti-Xa activity level of 1.16 IU/mL (n=16) and average exposure \n\ncorresponding to 88% of steady-state levels. Steady-state is achieved on the second day of treatment. \n\n \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous administration of 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once \n\ndaily regimens in healthy volunteers, the steady-state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio \n\nabout 15% higher than after a single dose. After repeated subcutaneous administration of the 100 IU/kg \n\n(1 mg/kg) twice daily regimen, the steady-state is reached from day 3 to 4 with mean exposure about 65% \n\nhigher than after a single dose and mean maximum and trough anti-Xa activity levels of about 1.2 and \n\n0.52 IU/mL, respectively.  \n\n \n\nInjection volume and dose concentration over the range 100-200 mg/mL does not affect pharmacokinetic \n\nparameters in healthy volunteers. \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges. \n\nIntra-patient and inter-patient variability is low. Following repeated subcutaneous administration no \n\naccumulation takes place. \n\n \n\nPlasma anti-IIa activity after subcutaneous administration is approximately ten-fold lower than anti-Xa \n\nactivity. The mean maximum anti-IIa activity level is observed approximately 3 to 4 hours following \n\nsubcutaneous injection and reaches 0.13 IU/mL and 0.19 IU/mL following repeated administration of \n\n100 IU/kg (1 mg/kg) twice daily and 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily, respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n241 \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution of enoxaparin sodium anti-Xa activity is about 4.3 litres and is close to the blood \n\nvolume. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or depolymerisation to lower \n\nmolecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium is a low clearance drug with a mean anti-Xa plasma clearance of 0.74 L/h after a 150 IU \n\n/kg (1.5 mg/kg) 6-hour intravenous infusion. \n\nElimination appears monophasic with a half-life of about 5 hours after a single subcutaneous dose to about \n\n7 hours after repeated dosing. \n\nRenal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion \n\nof active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the enoxaparin sodium kinetic profile is not \n\ndifferent in elderly subjects compared to younger subjects when renal function is normal. However, since \n\nrenal function is known to decline with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination of enoxaparin \n\nsodium (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with advanced cirrhosis treated with enoxaparin sodium 4,000 IU (40 mg) \n\nonce daily, a decrease in maximum anti-Xa activity was associated with an increase in the severity of hepatic \n\nimpairment (assessed by Child-Pugh categories). This decrease was mainly attributed to a decrease in ATIII \n\nlevel secondary to a reduced synthesis of ATIII in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA linear relationship between anti-Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady-state has been \n\nobserved, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. \n\nAnti-Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady-state, is marginally increased in mild (creatinine clearance \n\n50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\nclearance <30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated \n\nsubcutaneous 4,000 IU (40 mg) once daily doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemodialysis \n\nEnoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics appeared similar than control population, after a single 25 IU, 50 IU or \n\n100 IU/kg (0.25, 0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg) intravenous dose however, AUC was two-fold higher than control. \n\n \n\nWeight \n\nAfter repeated subcutaneous 150 IU/kg (1.5 mg/kg) once daily dosing, mean AUC of anti-Xa activity is \n\nmarginally higher at steady state in obese healthy volunteers (BMI 30-48 kg/m\n2\n) compared to non-obese \n\ncontrol subjects, while maximum plasma anti-Xa activity level is not increased. There is a lower weight-\n\nadjusted clearance in obese subjects with subcutaneous dosing. \n\n \n\nWhen non-weight adjusted dosing was administered, it was found after a single-subcutaneous 4,000 IU \n\n(40 mg) dose, that anti-Xa exposure is 52% higher in low-weight women (<45 kg) and 27% higher in low-\n\nweight men (<57 kg) when compared to normal weight control subjects (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n242 \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between enoxaparin sodium and thrombolytics when \n\nadministered concomitantly. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nBesides the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium, there was no evidence of adverse effects at \n\n15 mg/kg/day in the 13-week subcutaneous toxicity studies both in rats and dogs and at  10 mg/kg/day in the \n\n26-week subcutaneous and intravenous toxicity studies both in rats, and monkeys. \n\n \n\nEnoxaparin sodium has shown no mutagenic activity based on in vitro tests, including the Ames test, mouse \n\nlymphoma cell forward mutation test, and no clastogenic activity based on an in vitro human lymphocyte \n\nchromosomal aberration test, and the in vivo rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration test. \n\n \n\nStudies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at subcutaneous doses of enoxaparin sodium up to \n\n30 mg/kg/day did not reveal any evidence of teratogenic effects or foetotoxicity. Enoxaparin sodium was \n\nfound to have no effect on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats at subcutaneous \n\ndoses up to 20 mg/kg/day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Inhixa is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nInhixa contains the active substance called enoxaparin sodium that is a low molecular weight heparin \n\n(LMWH). \n\n \n\nInhixa works in two ways. \n\n1)  Stopping existing blood clots from getting any bigger. This helps your body to break them down and \n\nstop them causing you harm. \n\n2)  Stopping blood clots forming in your blood. \n\n \n\nInhixa can be used to: \n\n Treat blood clots that are in your blood \n\n Stop blood clots from forming in your blood in the following situations: \no Before and after an operation  \no When you have an acute illness and face period of limited mobility \no When you have unstable angina (a condition when not enough blood gets to your heart) \no After a heart attack \n\n Stop blood clots forming in the tubes of your dialysis machine (used for people with severe kidney \nproblems). \n\n  \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Inhixa \n\n \n\nDo not use Inhixa \n\n\n\n \n\n285 \n\n \n\n If you are allergic to enoxaparin sodium or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). Signs of an allergic reaction include: rash, swallowing or breathing problems, \n\nswelling of your lips, face, throat or tongue. \n\n If you are allergic to heparin or other low molecular weight heparins such as nadroparin, \ntinzaparin or dalteparin. \n\n If you have had a reaction to heparin that caused a severe drop in the number of your clotting \ncells (platelets) - this reaction is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - within the last 100 \n\ndays or if you have antibodies against enoxaparin in your blood. \n\n If you are bleeding heavily or have a condition with a high risk of bleeding (such as stomach \nulcer, recent surgery of the brain or eyes), including recent bleeding stroke. \n\n If you are using Inhixa to treat blood clots in your body and going to receive spinal or epidural \nanaesthesia or lumbar puncture within 24 hours. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nInhixa should not be used interchangeably with other medicines belonging to the group of low molecular \n\nweight heparins. This is because they are not exactly the same and do not have the same activity and \n\ninstructions for use. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Inhixa if: \n\n you have ever had a reaction to heparin that caused a severe drop in the number of your platelets \n\n you are going to receive spinal or epidural anesthesia or lumbar puncture (see Operations and \nAnaesthetics): a delay should be respected between Inhixa use and this procedure. \n\n you have had a heart valve fitted \n\n you have endocarditis (an infection of the inner lining of the heart) \n\n you have history of gastric ulcer \n\n you have had a recent stroke  \n\n you have high blood pressure \n\n you have diabetes or  problems with blood vessels in the eye caused by diabetes (called diabetic \nretinopathy)  \n\n you have had an operation recently on your eyes or brain \n\n you are elderly (over 65 years old) and especially if you are over 75 years old \n\n you have kidney problems \n\n you have liver problems \n\n you are underweight or overweight \n\n you have high level of potassium in your blood (this may be checked with a blood test) \n\n you are currently using medicines which affect bleeding (see section below – Other medicines). \n \n\nYou may have a blood test before you start using this medicine and at intervals while you are using it; this is \n\nto check the level of the clotting cells (platelets) and potassium in your blood. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Inhixa \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n Warfarin – used for thinning the blood \n\n Aspirin (also known as acetylsalicylic acid or ASA), clopidogrel or other medicines used to stop blood \nclots from forming (see also in section 3, “Changing of anticoagulant medicine”) \n\n Dextran injection – used as a blood replacer \n\n Ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac or other medicines known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents \nwhich are used to treat pain and swelling in arthritis and other conditions \n\n Prednisolone, dexamethasone or other medicines used to treat asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and other \nconditions \n\n Medicines which increase potassium level in your blood such as potassium salts, water pills, some \nmedicines for heart problems. \n\n \n\nOperations and anesthetics \n\n\n\n \n\n286 \n\n \n\nIf you are going to have a spinal puncture or an operation where an epidural or spinal anaesthetic is used, tell \n\nyour doctor that you are using Inhixa. See “Do not use Inhixa”. Also, tell your doctor if you have any \n\nproblem with your spine or if you ever had spinal surgery. \n\n \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. \n\nIf you are pregnant and have a mechanical heart valve, you may be at an increased risk of developing blood \n\nclots. Your doctor should discuss this with you. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, you should ask your doctor for advice before taking this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nInhixa does not affect the ability to drive and operate machinery. \n\n \n\nIt is advised that the trade name and batch number of the product you are using are recorded by your \n\nhealthcare professional. \n\n \n\nInhixa contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Inhixa \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHaving this medicine \n\n Your doctor or nurse will normally give you Inhixa. This is because it needs to be given as an injection. \n\n When you go home, you may need to continue to use Inhixa and give it yourself (see instructions below \non how to do this). \n\n Inhixa is usually given by injection underneath the skin (subcutaneous). \n\n Inhixa can be given by injection into your vein (intravenous) after certain types of heart attack or \noperation. \n\n Inhixa can be added to the tube leaving the body (arterial line) at the start of the dialysis session. \nDo not inject Inhixa into a muscle. \n\n \n\nHow much will be given to you \n\n Your doctor will decide how much Inhixa to give you. The amount will depend on the reason it is being \nused. \n\n If you have problems with your kidneys you may be given a smaller amount of Inhixa. \n \n\n1. Treating blood clots that are in your blood \n\n The usual dose is 150 IU (1.5 mg) for every kilogram of your weight each day or 100 IU (1 mg) for \nevery kilogram of your weight twice a day. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\n2. Stopping blood clots forming in your blood in the following situations: \n\n Operation or periods of limited mobility due to an illness \n\n The dose will depend on how likely you are to develop a clot. You will be given 2,000 IU (20 mg) \nor 4,000 IU (40 mg) of Inhixa each day.  \n\n If you are going to have an operation your first injection will be usually given 2 hours or 12 hours \nbefore your operation.  \n\n\n\n \n\n287 \n\n \n\n If you have restricted mobility due to illness, you will normally be given 4,000 IU (40 mg) of \nInhixa each day. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\n After you have had a heart attack \nInhixa can be used for two different types of heart attack called STEMI (ST segment elevation myocardial \n\ninfarction) or Non STEMI (NSTEMI). The amount of Inhixa given to you will depend on your age and the \n\nkind of heart attack you have had. \n\n \n\nNSTEMI type of heart attack:  \n\n The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of weight every 12 hours.  \n\n Your doctor will normally ask you to take aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as well. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nSTEMI type of heart attack if you are under 75 years old: \n\n An initial dose of 3,000 IU (30 mg) of Inhixa  will be given as injection into your vein. \n\n At the same time you will also be given Inhixa as an injection underneath your skin (subcutaneous \ninjection). The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, every 12 hours.  \n\n Your doctor will normally ask you to take aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as well. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nSTEMI type of heart attack if you are 75 years old or older: \n\n The usual dose is 75 IU (0.75 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, every 12 hours. \n\n The maximum amount of Inhixa given for the first two injections is 7,500 IU (75 mg). \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nFor patients have an operation called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): \n\nDepending on when you were last given Inhixa, your doctor may decide to give an additional dose of \n\nInhixa before a PCI operation. This is by injection into your vein. \n\n \n\n3. Stopping blood clots from forming in the tubes of your dialysis machine \n\n The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight. \n\n Inhixa is added to the tube leaving the body (arterial line) at the start of the dialysis session. This \namount is usually enough for a 4-hour session. However, your doctor may give you a further dose of \n\n50 IU to 100 IU (0.5 to 1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, if necessary. \n\n \n\nHow to give yourself an injection of Inhixa \n\nIf you are able to give this medicine to yourself, your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this. Do not \n\ntry to inject yourself if you have not been trained how to do so. If you are not sure what to do, talk to your \n\ndoctor or nurse immediately. \n\n \n\nBefore injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n- Check the expiry date on the medicine. Do not use if the date has passed. \n\n- Check the syringe is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear solution. If not, use another \n\nsyringe. \n\n- Do not use this medicine if you notice any change in the appearance of the product. \n\n- Make sure you know how much you are going to inject. \n\n- Check your abdomen to see if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin colour, swelling, \n\noozing or is still painful, if so talk to your doctor or nurse. \n\n- Decide where you are going to inject the medicine. Change the place where you inject each time \n\nfrom the right to the left side of your stomach. This medicine should be injected just under the skin \n\non your stomach, but not too near the belly button or any scar tissue (at least 5 cm away from these). \n\n- The pre-filled syringe is intended for single use only. \n\n \n\nInstructions on injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n1)  Wash your hands and the area that you will inject with soap and water. Dry them. \n\n\n\n \n\n288 \n\n \n\n2)  Sit or lie in a comfortable position so you are relaxed. Make sure you can see the place you are going \n\nto inject. A lounge chair, recliner, or bed propped up with pillows is ideal. \n\n3)  Choose an area on the right or left side of your stomach. This should be at least 5 cm away from \n\nyour belly button and out towards your sides. \n\n \n\nRemember: Do not inject yourself within 5 cm of your belly button or around existing scars or bruises. \n\nChange the place where you inject between the left and right sides of your stomach, depending on the area \n\nyou were last injected. \n\n \n\n4)  Carefully pull off the needle cap from the syringe. Throw away the cap. The syringe is pre-filled and \n\nready to use. \n\n \nDo not press on the plunger before injecting yourself to get rid of air bubbles. This can lead to a loss of the \n\nmedicine. Once you have removed the cap, do not allow the needle to touch anything. This is to make sure \n\nthe needle stays clean (sterile). \n\n \n\n5)  Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, gently pinch the \n\ncleaned area of your abdomen between your forefinger and thumb to make a fold in the skin. \n\n \n\nMake sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n\n \n\n6)  Hold the syringe so that the needle is pointing downwards (vertically at a 90º angle). Insert the full \n\nlength of the needle into the skin fold. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n7)  Press down on the plunger with your finger. This will send the medicine into the fatty tissue of the \n\nstomach. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n\n \n\n8)  Remove the needle by pulling it straight out. \n\n \nTo avoid bruising, do not rub the injection site after you have injected yourself. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n289 \n\n \n\n9)  Drop the used syringe into the sharps container. Close the container lid tightly and place the \n\ncontainer out of reach of children. \n\n \n\nWhen the container is full, dispose of it as your doctor or pharmacist has instructed. Do not put it in \n\nthe household rubbish. \n\n \n\nHow to give yourself an injection of Inhixa \n\nYour pre-filled syringe has a needle guard attached to it in order to protect you from needle stick injury. \n\nIf you are able to give this medicine to yourself, your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this. Do not \n\ntry to inject yourself if you have not been trained how to do so.

This will send the medicine into the fatty tissue of the \n\nstomach. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n\n \n\n8)  Remove the needle by pulling it straight out. Do not release the pressure on the plunger! \n\n \nTo avoid bruising, do not rub the injection site after you have injected yourself. \n \n\n9)  Push hard the plunger. The needle guard, which is in the form of a plastic cylinder, will be activated \n\nautomatically and it will completely cover the needle. \n\n \n10)  Drop the used syringe into the sharps container. Close the container lid tightly and place the \n\ncontainer out of reach of children. \n\n \n\nWhen the container is full, dispose of it as your doctor or pharmacist has instructed.

Do not start treatment with Inhixa until 12 hours after the final dose \n\nof direct oral anticoagulant. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Inhixa has not been evaluated in children or adolescents.  \n\n \n\nIf you use more Inhixa than you should \n\nIf you think that you have used too much or too little Inhixa, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \n\nimmediately, even if you have no signs of a problem. If a child accidentally injects or swallows Inhixa, take \n\nthem to a hospital causualty department straight away. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n293 \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Inhixa \nIf you forget to give yourself a dose, have it as soon as you remember. Do not give yourself a double dose on \n\nthe same day to make up for a forgotten dose. Keeping a diary will help to make sure you do not miss a dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Inhixa  \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n\nIt is important for you to keep having Inhixa injections until your doctor decides to stop them. If you stop, \n\nyou could get a blood clot which can be very dangerous. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike other similar medicines (medicines to reduce blood clotting), Inhixa may cause bleeding which may \n\npotentially be life-threatening. In some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. \n\n \n\nIf you experience any bleeding event that does not stop by itself or if you experience signs of excessive \n\nbleeding (exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling), consult \n\nyour doctor immediately. \n\nYour doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or change your medicine. \n\n \n\nStop using Inhixa and talk to a doctor or nurse at once if you get any signs of a severe allergic reaction (such \n\nas difficulty breathing, swelling of the lips, mouth, throat or eyes). \n\n \n\nYou should tell your doctor straight away  \n\n If you have any sign of blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot such as: \n- cramping pain, redness, warmth, or swelling in one of your legs – these are symptoms of deep vein \n\nthrombosis \n\n- breathlessness, chest pain, fainting or coughing up blood – these are symptoms of a pulmonary \nembolism  \n\n If you have a painful rash of dark red spots under the skin which do not go away when you put pressure \non them.  \n\nYour doctor may request you perform a blood test to check your platelet count. \n\n \n\nOverall list of possible side effects: \n\nVery common ( may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n Bleeding. \n\n Increases in liver enzymes. \n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n You bruise more easily than usual. This could be because of a blood problem with low platelet counts. \n\n Pink patches on your skin. These are more likely to appear in the area you have been injected with \nInhixa. \n\n Skin rash (hives, urticaria). \n\n Itchy red skin. \n\n Bruising or pain at the injection site. \n\n Decreased red blood cell count. \n\n High platelet counts in the blood. \n\n Headache. \n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Sudden severe headache. This could be a sign of bleeding in the brain.  \n\n A feeling of tenderness and swelling in your stomach. You may have bleeding in your stomach.  \n\n Large red irregularly shaped skin lesions with or without blisters. \n\n Skin irritation (local irritation). \n\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Deep-vein-thrombosis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Deep-vein-thrombosis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shortness-of-breath/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chest-pain/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Fainting/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coughing-up-blood/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pulmonary-embolism/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pulmonary-embolism/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\n\n\n \n\n294 \n\n \n\n You notice yellowing of your skin or eyes and your urine becomes darker in colour. This could be a \nliver problem. \n\n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction.  The signs may include: a rash, swallowing or breathing problems, swelling of \nyour lips, face, throat or tongue. \n\n Increased potassium in your blood. This is more likely to happen in people with kidney problems or \ndiabetes. Your doctor will be able to check this by carrying out a blood test. \n\n An increase in the number of eosinophils in your blood. Your doctor will be able to check this by \ncarrying out a blood test. \n\n Hair loss.  \n\n Osteoporosis (a condition where your bones are more likely to break) after long term use. \n\n Tingling, numbness and muscular weakness (particularly in the lower part of your body) when you \nhave had a spinal puncture or a spinal anaesthetic.  \n\n Lost of control over your bladder or bowel (so you cannot control when you go to the toilet). \n\n Hard mass or lump at the injection site.  \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What Inhixa is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nInhixa contains the active substance called enoxaparin sodium that is a low molecular weight heparin \n\n(LMWH). \n\n \n\nInhixa works in two ways. \n\n1)  Stopping existing blood clots from getting any bigger. This helps your body to break them down and \n\nstop them causing you harm. \n\n2)  Stopping blood clots forming in your blood. \n\n \n\nInhixa can be used to: \n\n Treat blood clots that are in your blood \n\n Stop blood clots from forming in your blood in the following situations: \no Before and after an operation  \no When you have an acute illness and face period of limited mobility \no When you have unstable angina (a condition when not enough blood gets to your heart) \no After a heart attack \n\n Stop blood clots forming in the tubes of your dialysis machine (used for people with severe kidney \nproblems). \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Inhixa \n\n \n\nDo not use Inhixa \n\n If you are allergic to enoxaparin sodium or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). Signs of an allergic reaction include: rash, swallowing or breathing problems, swelling of \n\nyour lips, face, throat or tongue. \n\n\n\n \n\n299 \n\n \n\n If you are allergic to heparin or other low molecular weight heparins such as nadroparin, tinzaparin or \ndalteparin. \n\n If you have had a reaction to heparin that caused a severe drop in the number of your clotting cells \n(platelets) - this reaction is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - within the last 100 days or if \n\nyou have antibodies against enoxaparin in your blood. \n\n If you are bleeding heavily or have a condition with a high risk of bleeding (such as stomach ulcer, \nrecent surgery of the brain or eyes), including recent bleeding stroke. \n\n If you are using Inhixa to treat blood clots in your body and going to receive spinal or epidural \nanaesthesia or lumbar puncture within 24 hours. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nInhixa should not be used interchangeably with other medicines belonging to the group of low molecular \n\nweight heparins. This is because they are not exactly the same and do not have the same activity and \n\ninstructions for use. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Inhixa if: \n\n you have ever had a reaction to heparin that caused a severe drop in the number of your platelets \n\n you are going to receive spinal or epidural anesthesia or lumbar puncture (see Operations and \nAnaesthetics): a delay should be respected between Inhixa use and this procedure. \n\n you have had a heart valve fitted \n\n you have endocarditis (an infection of the inner lining of the heart) \n\n you have history of gastric ulcer \n\n you have had a recent stroke  \n\n you have high blood pressure \n\n you have diabetes or  problems with blood vessels in the eye caused by diabetes (called diabetic \nretinopathy)  \n\n you have had an operation recently on your eyes or brain \n\n you are elderly (over 65 years old) and especially if you are over 75 years old \n\n you have kidney problems \n\n you have liver problems \n\n you are underweight or overweight \n\n you have high level of potassium in your blood (this may be checked with a blood test) \n\n you are currently using medicines which affect bleeding (see section below – Other medicines). \n \n\nYou may have a blood test before you start using this medicine and at intervals while you are using it; this is \n\nto check the level of the clotting cells (platelets) and potassium in your blood. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Inhixa has not been evaluated in children or adolescents.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Inhixa \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n Warfarin – used for thinning the blood \n\n Aspirin (also known as acetylsalicylic acid or ASA), clopidogrel or other medicines used to stop blood \nclots from forming (see also in section 3, “Changing of anticoagulant medicine”) \n\n Dextran injection – used as a blood replacer \n\n Ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac or other medicines known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents \nwhich are used to treat pain and swelling in arthritis and other conditions \n\n Prednisolone, dexamethasone or other medicines used to treat asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and other \nconditions \n\n Medicines which increase potassium level in your blood such as potassium salts, water pills, some \nmedicines for heart problems. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n300 \n\n \n\nOperations and anaesthetics \n\nIf you are going to have a spinal puncture or an operation where an epidural or spinal anaesthetic is used, tell \n\nyour doctor that you are using Inhixa. See “Do not use Inhixa”. Also, tell your doctor if you have any \n\nproblem with your spine or if you ever had spinal surgery. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. \n\nIf you are pregnant and have a mechanical heart valve, you may be at an increased risk of developing blood \n\nclots. Your doctor should discuss this with you. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, you should ask your doctor for advice before taking this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nInhixa does not affect the ability to drive and operate machinery. \n\n \n\nIt is advised that the trade name and batch number of the product you are using are recorded by your \n\nhealthcare professional. \n\n \n\nInhixa contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Inhixa \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHaving this medicine \n\n Your doctor or nurse will normally give you Inhixa. This is because it needs to be given as an \ninjection. \n\n When you go home, you may need to continue to use Inhixa and give it yourself (see instructions \nbelow on how to do this). \n\n Inhixa is usually given by injection underneath the skin (subcutaneous). \n\n Inhixa can be given by injection into your vein (intravenous) after certain types of heart attack or \noperation. \n\n Inhixa can be added to the tube leaving the body (arterial line) at the start of the dialysis session. \nDo not inject Inhixa into a muscle. \n\n \n\nHow much will be given to you \n\n Your doctor will decide how much Inhixa to give you. The amount will depend on the reason it is \nbeing used. \n\n If you have problems with your kidneys you may be given a smaller amount of Inhixa. \n \n\n1. Treating blood clots that are in your blood \n\n The usual dose is 150 IU (1.5 mg) for every kilogram of your weight each day or 100 IU (1 mg) for \nevery kilogram of your weight twice a day. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\n2. Stopping blood clots forming in your blood in the following situations: \n\n Operation or periods of limited mobility due to an illness \n\n The dose will depend on how likely you are to develop a clot. You will be given 2,000 IU \n(20 mg) or 4,000 IU (40 mg) of Inhixa each day.  \n\n If you are going to have an operation your first injection will be usually given 2 hours or \n12 hours before your operation.  \n\n\n\n \n\n301 \n\n \n\n If you have restricted mobility due to illness, you will normally be given 4,000 IU (40 mg) of \nInhixa each day. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\n After you have had a heart attack \nInhixa can be used for two different types of heart attack called STEMI (ST segment elevation myocardial \n\ninfarction) or Non STEMI (NSTEMI). The amount of Inhixa given to you will depend on your age and the \n\nkind of heart attack you have had. \n\n \n\nNSTEMI type of heart attack:  \n\n The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of weight every 12 hours.  \n\n Your doctor will normally ask you to take aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as well. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nSTEMI type of heart attack if you are under 75 years old: \n\n An initial dose of 3,000 IU (30 mg) of Inhixa  will be given as injection into your vein. \n\n At the same time you will also be given Inhixa as an injection underneath your skin (subcutaneous \ninjection). The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, every 12 hours.  \n\n Your doctor will normally ask you to take aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as well. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nSTEMI type of heart attack if you are 75 years old or older: \n\n The usual dose is 75 IU (0.75 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, every 12 hours. \n\n The maximum amount of Inhixa given for the first two injections is 7,500 IU (75 mg). \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nFor patients have an operation called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): \n\nDepending on when you were last given Inhixa, your doctor may decide to give an additional dose of Inhixa \n\nbefore a PCI operation. This is by injection into your vein. \n\n \n\n3. Stopping blood clots from forming in the tubes of your dialysis machine \n\n The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight. \n\n Inhixa is added to the tube leaving the body (arterial line) at the start of the dialysis session. This \namount is usually enough for a 4-hour session. However, your doctor may give you a further dose of \n\n50 IU to 100 IU (0.5 to 1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, if necessary. \n\n \n\nHow to give yourself an injection of Inhixa \n\n \n\nIf you are able to give this medicine to yourself, your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this. Do not \n\ntry to inject yourself if you have not been trained how to do so. If you are not sure what to do, talk to your \n\ndoctor or nurse immediately. \n\n \n\nBefore injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n- Check the expiry date on the medicine. Do not use if the date has passed. \n\n- Check the syringe is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear solution. If not, use another syringe. \n\n- Do not use this medicine if you notice any change in the appearance of the product. \n\n- Make sure you know how much you are going to inject. \n\n- Check your abdomen to see if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin colour, swelling, \n\noozing or is still painful, if so talk to your doctor or nurse. \n\n- Decide where you are going to inject the medicine. Change the place where you inject each time from \n\nthe right to the left side of your stomach. This medicine should be injected just under the skin on your \n\nstomach, but not too near the belly button or any scar tissue (at least 5 cm away from these). \n\n- The pre-filled syringe is intended for single use only. \n\n \n\nInstructions on injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n1)  Wash your hands and the area that you will inject with soap and water. Dry them. \n\n\n\n \n\n302 \n\n \n\n2)  Sit or lie in a comfortable position so you are relaxed. Make sure you can see the place you are going \n\nto inject. A lounge chair, recliner, or bed propped up with pillows is ideal. \n\n3)  Choose an area on the right or left side of your stomach. This should be at least 5 cm away from your \n\nbelly button and out towards your sides. \n\n \n\nRemember: Do not inject yourself within 5 cm of your belly button or around existing scars or bruises. \n\nChange the place where you inject between the left and right sides of your stomach, depending on the area \n\nyou were last injected. \n\n \n\n4)  Carefully pull off the needle cap from the syringe. Throw away the cap. The syringe is pre-filled and \n\nready to use. \n\n \nDo not press on the plunger before injecting yourself to get rid of air bubbles. This can lead to a loss of the \n\nmedicine. Once you have removed the cap, do not allow the needle to touch anything. This is to make sure \n\nthe needle stays clean (sterile). \n\n \n\n5)  Hold the syringe in the hand you write with (like a pencil) and with your other hand, gently pinch the \n\ncleaned area of your abdomen between your forefinger and thumb to make a fold in the skin \n\n \n\nMake sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n\n \n\n6)  Hold the syringe so that the needle is pointing downwards (vertically at a 90º angle). Insert the full \n\nlength of the needle into the skin fold \n\n \n\n \n \n\n7)  Press down on the plunger with your finger. This will send the medicine into the fatty tissue of the \n\nstomach. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection \n\n \n\n8)  Remove the needle by pulling it straight out. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTo avoid bruising, do not rub the injection site after you have injected yourself. \n \n\n9)  Drop the used syringe into the sharps container. Close the container lid tightly and place the container \n\nout of reach of children. \n\n\n\n \n\n303 \n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the container is full, dispose of it as your doctor or pharmacist has instructed. Do not put it in \n\nthe household rubbish. \n\n \n\nHow to give yourself an injection of Inhixa \n\nYour pre-filled syringe has a needle guard attached to it in order to protect you from needle stick injury. \n\nIf you are able to give this medicine to yourself, your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this. Do not \n\ntry to inject yourself if you have not been trained how to do so. If you are not sure what to do, talk to your \n\ndoctor or nurse immediately. \n\n \n\nBefore injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n- Check the expiry date on the medicine. Do not use if the date has passed. \n\n- Check the syringe is not damaged and the medicine in it is a clear solution. If not, use another \n\nsyringe. \n\n- Do not use this medicine if you notice any change in the appearance of the product. \n\n- Make sure you know how much you are going to inject. \n\n- Check your abdomen to see if the last injection caused any redness, change in skin colour, swelling, \n\noozing or is still painful, if so talk to your doctor or nurse. \n\n- Decide where you are going to inject the medicine. Change the place where you inject each time \n\nfrom the right to the left side of your stomach. This medicine should be injected just under the skin \n\non your stomach, but not too near the belly button or any scar tissue (at least 5 cm away from these). \n\n- The pre-filled syringe is intended for single use only. \n\n \n\nInstructions on injecting yourself with Inhixa \n\n1)  Wash your hands and the area that you will inject with soap and water.

This will send the medicine into the fatty tissue of the \n\nstomach. Make sure you hold the skin fold throughout the injection. \n\n \n\n8)  Remove the needle by pulling it straight out. Do not release the pressure on the plunger! \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTo avoid bruising, do not rub the injection site after you have injected yourself. \n \n\n9)  Push hard the plunger. The needle guard, which is in the form of a plastic cylinder, will be activated \n\nautomatically and it will completely cover the needle. \n\n \n10)  Drop the used syringe into the sharps container. Close the container lid tightly and place the \n\ncontainer out of reach of children. \n\n \n\nWhen the container is full, dispose of it as your doctor or pharmacist has instructed. Do not put it in \n\nthe household rubbish. \n\n \n\nChanging of anticoagulant treatment \n\n- Changing from Inhixa to blood thinners called vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) \nYour doctor will request you perform blood tests called INR and tell you when to stop Inhixa \n\naccordingly. \n\n \n\n- Changing from blood thinners called vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) to Inhixa   \nStop taking the vitamin-K antagonist. Your doctor will request you perform blood tests called INR and \n\ntell you when to start Inhixa accordingly. \n\n \n\n- Changing from Inhixa to treatment with direct oral anticoagulant \nStop taking Inhixa. Start taking the direct oral anticoagulant 0-2 hours before the time you would have \n\nhad the next injection, then continue as normal. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n305 \n\n \n\n- Changing from treatment with direct oral anticoagulant to Inhixa \nStop taking direct oral anticoagulant. Do not start treatment with Inhixa until 12 hours after the final \n\ndose of direct oral anticoagulant. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Inhixa than you should \n\nIf you think that you have used too much or too little Inhixa, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \n\nimmediately, even if you have no signs of a problem. If a child accidentally injects or swallows Inhixa, take \n\nthem to a hospital causualty department straight away. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Inhixa \n\nIf you forget to give yourself a dose, have it as soon as you remember. Do not give yourself a double dose on \n\nthe same day to make up for a forgotten dose. Keeping a diary will help to make sure you do not miss a dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Inhixa  \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n\nIt is important for you to keep having Inhixa injections until your doctor decides to stop them. If you stop, \n\nyou could get a blood clot which can be very dangerous. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n\n \n\nLike other similar medicines (medicines to reduce blood clotting), Inhixa may cause bleeding which may \n\npotentially be life-threatening. In some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. \n\n \n\nIf you experience any bleeding event that does not stop by itself or if you experience signs of excessive \n\nbleeding (exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling), consult \n\nyour doctor immediately. \n\nYour doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or change your medicine. \n\n \n\nStop using Inhixa and talk to a doctor or nurse at once if you get any signs of a severe allergic reaction (such \n\nas difficulty breathing, swelling of the lips, mouth, throat or eyes). \n\n \n\nYou should tell your doctor straight away  \n\n If you have any sign of blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot such as: \n- cramping pain, redness, warmth, or swelling in one of your legs – these are symptoms of deep \n\nvein thrombosis \n\n- breathlessness, chest pain, fainting or coughing up blood – these are symptoms of a pulmonary \nembolism  \n\n If you have a painful rash of dark red spots under the skin which do not go away when you put \npressure on them.  \n\nYour doctor may request you perform a blood test to check your platelet count. \n\n \n\nOverall list of possible side effects \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n Bleeding. \n\n Increases in liver enzymes. \n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n You bruise more easily than usual. This could be because of a blood problem with low platelet counts. \n\n Pink patches on your skin. These are more likely to appear in the area you have been injected with \nInhixa. \n\n Skin rash (hives, urticaria). \n\n Itchy red skin. \n\n Bruising or pain at the injection site. \n\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Deep-vein-thrombosis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Deep-vein-thrombosis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shortness-of-breath/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chest-pain/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Fainting/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coughing-up-blood/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pulmonary-embolism/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pulmonary-embolism/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\n\n\n \n\n306 \n\n \n\n Decreased red blood cell count. \n\n High platelet counts in the blood. \n\n Headache. \n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Sudden severe headache. This could be a sign of bleeding in the brain.  \n\n A feeling of tenderness and swelling in your stomach. You may have bleeding in your stomach.  \n\n Large red irregularly shaped skin lesions with or without blisters. \n\n Skin irritation (local irritation). \n\n You notice yellowing of your skin or eyes and your urine becomes darker in colour. This could be \na liver problem. \n\n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction.  The signs may include: a rash, swallowing or breathing problems, swelling \nof your lips, face, throat or tongue. \n\n Increased potassium in your blood. This is more likely to happen in people with kidney problems or \ndiabetes. Your doctor will be able to check this by carrying out a blood test. \n\n An increase in the number of eosinophils in your blood. Your doctor will be able to check this by \ncarrying out a blood test. \n\n Hair loss.  \n\n Osteoporosis (a condition where your bones are more likely to break) after long term use. \n\n Tingling, numbness and muscular weakness (particularly in the lower part of your body) when you \nhave had a spinal puncture or a spinal anaesthetic.  \n\n Lost of control over your bladder or bowel (so you cannot control when you go to the toilet). \n\n Hard mass or lump at the injection site.  \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you use Inhixa \n\n3. How to use Inhixa \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Inhixa  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Inhixa is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nInhixa contains the active substance called enoxaparin sodium that is a low molecular weight heparin \n\n(LMWH). \n\n \n\nInhixa works in two ways. \n\n1)  Stopping existing blood clots from getting any bigger. This helps your body to break them down and \n\nstop them causing you harm. \n\n2)  Stopping blood clots forming in your blood. \n\n \n\nInhixa can be used to: \n\n Treat blood clots that are in your blood \n\n Stop blood clots from forming in your blood in the following situations: \no Before and after an operation  \no When you have an acute illness and face period of limited mobility \no When you have unstable angina (a condition when not enough blood gets to your heart) \no After a heart attack \nStop blood clots forming in the tubes of your dialysis machine (used for people with severe kidney \n\nproblems). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n310 \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Inhixa \n\n \n\nDo not use Inhixa \n\n- if you are allergic to enoxaparin sodium or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). Signs of an allergic reaction include: rash, swallowing or breathing problems, swelling of \n\nyour lips, face, throat or tongue \n\n- if you are allergic to heparin or other low molecular weight heparins such as nadroparin, tinzaparin or \ndalteparin \n\n- if you have had a reaction to heparin that caused a severe drop in the number of your clotting cells \n(platelets) - this reaction is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - within the last 100 days or if \n\nyou have antibodies against enoxaparin in your blood \n\n- if you are bleeding heavily or have a condition with a high risk of bleeding (such as stomach ulcer, \nrecent surgery of the brain or eyes), including recent bleeding stroke \n\n- if you are using Inhixa to treat blood clots in your body and going to receive spinal or epidural \nanaesthesia or lumbar puncture within 24 hours \n\n- if the patient is a premature or newborn baby up to 1 month because of the risk of severe toxicity \nincluding abnormal respiration (“gasping syndrome”). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nInhixa should not be used interchangeably with other medicines belonging to the group of low molecular \n\nweight heparins. This is because they are not exactly the same and do not have the same activity and \n\ninstructions for use. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Inhixa if: \n\n you have ever had a reaction to heparin that caused a severe drop in the number of your platelets \n\n you are going to receive spinal or epidural anesthesia or lumbar puncture (see section “Operations and \nAnaesthetics”): a delay should be respected between Inhixa use and this procedure \n\n you have had a heart valve fitted \n\n you have endocarditis (an infection of the inner lining of the heart) \n\n you have history of gastric ulcer \n\n you have had a recent stroke  \n\n you have high blood pressure \n\n you have diabetes or  problems with blood vessels in the eye caused by diabetes (called diabetic \nretinopathy)  \n\n you have had an operation recently on your eyes or brain \n\n you are elderly (over 65 years old) and especially if you are over 75 years old \n\n you have kidney problems \n\n you have liver problems \n\n you are underweight or overweight \n\n you have high level of potassium in your blood (this may be checked with a blood test) \n\n you are currently using medicines which affect bleeding (see section “Other medicines”). \n \n\nYou may have a blood test before you start using this medicine and at intervals while you are using it; this is \n\nto check the level of the clotting cells (platelets) and potassium in your blood. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Inhixa has not been evaluated in children or adolescents.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Inhixa \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n Warfarin – used for thinning the blood \n\n Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel or other medicines used to stop blood clots from forming (see \nalso section 3, “Changing of anticoagulant medicine”) \n\n Dextran injection – used as a blood replacer \n\n\n\n \n\n311 \n\n \n\n Ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac or other medicines known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents \nwhich are used to treat pain and swelling in arthritis and other conditions \n\n Prednisolone, dexamethasone or other medicines used to treat asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and other \nconditions \n\n Medicines which increase potassium level in your blood such as potassium salts, water pills, some \nmedicines for heart problems. \n\n \n\nOperations and anaesthetics \n\nIf you are going to have a spinal puncture or an operation where an epidural or spinal anaesthetic is used, tell \n\nyour doctor that you are using Inhixa. See section “Do not use Inhixa”. Also, tell your doctor if you have any \n\nproblem with your spine or if you ever had spinal surgery. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist \n\nfor advice before using this medicine. \n\nIf you are pregnant and have a mechanical heart valve, you may be at an increased risk of developing blood \n\nclots. Your doctor should discuss this with you. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, you should ask your doctor for advice before using this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nInhixa does not affect the ability to drive and operate machinery. \n\n \n\nIt is advised that the trade name and batch number of the product you are using are recorded by your \n\nhealthcare professional. \n\n \n\nInhixa contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose within the recommended dose range, that \n\nis to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Inhixa  \n\nInhixa contains benzyl alcohol (45 mg/3 mL; 75 mg/5 mL; 150 mg/10 mL). Benzyl alcohol may cause \n\nallergic reactions. \n\n \n\nBenzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \n\n“gasping syndrome”) in young children. \n\n \n\nDo not give to your newborn baby (up to 4 weeks old), unless recommended by your doctor. Do not use for \n\nmore than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease, or if you are pregnant or \n\nbreast-feeding. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause \n\nside effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Inhixa \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHaving this medicine \n\n Your doctor or nurse will normally give you Inhixa. This is because it needs to be given as an \ninjection. \n\n When you go home, you may need to continue to use Inhixa and give it yourself. \n\n Inhixa is usually given by injection underneath the skin (subcutaneous). \n\n\n\n \n\n312 \n\n \n\n Inhixa can be given by injection into your vein (intravenous) after certain types of heart attack or \noperation. \n\n Inhixa can be added to the tube leaving the body (arterial line) at the start of the dialysis session. \nDo not inject Inhixa into a muscle. \n\n \n\nHow much will be given to you \n\n Your doctor will decide how much Inhixa to give you. The amount will depend on the reason it is \nbeing used. \n\n If you have problems with your kidneys you may be given a smaller amount of Inhixa. \n \n\n1. Treating blood clots that are in your blood \n\n The usual dose is 150 IU (1.5 mg) for every kilogram of your weight each day or 100 IU (1 mg) for \nevery kilogram of your weight twice a day. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\n2. Stopping blood clots forming in your blood in the following situations: \n\nOperation or periods of limited mobility due to an illness \n\n The dose will depend on how likely you are to develop a clot. You will be given 2,000 IU (20 mg) or \n4,000 IU (40 mg) of Inhixa each day.  \n\n If you are going to have an operation your first injection will be usually given 2 hours or 12 hours \nbefore your operation.  \n\n If you have restricted mobility due to illness, you will normally be given 4,000 IU (40 mg) of Inhixa \neach day. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nAfter you have had a heart attack \n\nInhixa can be used for two different types of heart attack called STEMI (ST segment elevation myocardial \n\ninfarction) or Non STEMI (NSTEMI). The amount of Inhixa given to you will depend on your age and the \n\nkind of heart attack you have had. \n\n \n\nNSTEMI type of heart attack:  \n\n The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of weight every 12 hours.  \n\n Your doctor will normally ask you to take acetylsalicylic acid as well. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nSTEMI type of heart attack if you are under 75 years old: \n\n An initial dose of 3,000 IU (30 mg) of Inhixa  will be given as injection into your vein. \n\n At the same time you will also be given Inhixa as an injection underneath your skin (subcutaneous \ninjection). The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, every 12 hours.  \n\n Your doctor will normally ask you to take acetylsalicylic acid as well. \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nSTEMI type of heart attack if you are 75 years old or older: \n\n The usual dose is 75 IU (0.75 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, every 12 hours. \n\n The maximum amount of Inhixa given for the first two injections is 7,500 IU (75 mg). \n\n Your doctor will decide how long you should receive Inhixa. \n \n\nFor patients have an operation called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): \n\nDepending on when you were last given Inhixa, your doctor may decide to give an additional dose of Inhixa \n\nbefore a PCI operation. This is by injection into your vein. \n\n \n\n3. Stopping blood clots from forming in the tubes of your dialysis machine \n\n The usual dose is 100 IU (1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight. \n\n\n\n \n\n313 \n\n \n\n Inhixa is added to the tube leaving the body (arterial line) at the start of the dialysis session. This \namount is usually enough for a 4-hour session. However, your doctor may give you a further dose of \n\n50 IU to 100 IU (0.5 to 1 mg) for every kilogram of your weight, if necessary. \n\n \n\nChanging of anticoagulant treatment \n\nChanging from Inhixa to blood thinners called vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) \n\nYour doctor will request you perform blood tests called INR and tell you when to stop Inhixa accordingly. \n\n \n\nChanging from blood thinners called vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) to Inhixa   \n\nStop taking the vitamin-K antagonist. Your doctor will request you perform blood tests called INR and tell \n\nyou when to start Inhixa accordingly. \n\n \n\nChanging from Inhixa to treatment with direct oral anticoagulant \n\nStop using Inhixa. Start taking the direct oral anticoagulant 0-2 hours before the time you would have had the \n\nnext injection, then continue as normal. \n\n \n\nChanging from treatment with direct oral anticoagulant to Inhixa \n\nStop taking direct oral anticoagulant. Do not start treatment with Inhixa until 12 hours after the final dose of \n\ndirect oral anticoagulant. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Inhixa than you should \n\nIf you think that you have used too much or too little Inhixa, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \n\nimmediately, even if you have no signs of a problem. If a child accidentally injects or swallows Inhixa, take \n\nthem to a hospital causualty department straight away. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Inhixa \nIf you forget to give yourself a dose, have it as soon as you remember. Do not give yourself a double dose on \n\nthe same day to make up for a forgotten dose. Keeping a diary will help to make sure you do not miss a dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Inhixa  \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n\nIt is important for you to keep having Inhixa injections until your doctor decides to stop them. If you stop, \n\nyou could get a blood clot which can be very dangerous. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nLike other similar medicines (medicines to reduce blood clotting), Inhixa may cause bleeding which may \n\npotentially be life-threatening. In some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. \n\n \n\nIf you experience any bleeding event that does not stop by itself or if you experience signs of excessive \n\nbleeding (exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling), consult \n\nyour doctor immediately. \n\nYour doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or change your medicine. \n\n \n\nStop using Inhixa and talk to a doctor or nurse at once if you get any signs of a severe allergic reaction (such \n\nas difficulty breathing, swelling of the lips, mouth, throat or eyes). \n\n \n\nYou should tell your doctor straight away  \n\n if you have any sign of blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot such as: \no cramping pain, redness, warmth, or swelling in one of your legs – these are symptoms of deep \n\nvein thrombosis \n\no breathlessness, chest pain, fainting or coughing up blood – these are symptoms of a pulmonary \nembolism  \n\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Deep-vein-thrombosis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Deep-vein-thrombosis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shortness-of-breath/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chest-pain/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Fainting/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coughing-up-blood/Pages/Introduction.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pulmonary-embolism/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pulmonary-embolism/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\n\n\n \n\n314 \n\n \n\n if you have a painful rash of dark red spots under the skin which do not go away when you put \npressure on them.  \n\nYour doctor may request you perform a blood test to check your platelet count. \n\n \n\nOverall list of possible side effects \n\nVery common ( may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n Bleeding. \n\n Increases in liver enzymes. \n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n You bruise more easily than usual. This could be because of a blood problem with low platelet counts. \n\n Pink patches on your skin. These are more likely to appear in the area you have been injected with \nInhixa. \n\n Skin rash (hives, urticaria). \n\n Itchy red skin. \n\n Bruising or pain at the injection site. \n\n Decreased red blood cell count. \n\n High platelet counts in the blood. \n\n Headache. \n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Sudden severe headache. This could be a sign of bleeding in the brain.  \n\n A feeling of tenderness and swelling in your stomach. You may have bleeding in your stomach.  \n\n Large red irregularly shaped skin lesions with or without blisters. \n\n Skin irritation (local irritation). \n\n You notice yellowing of your skin or eyes and your urine becomes darker in colour.
