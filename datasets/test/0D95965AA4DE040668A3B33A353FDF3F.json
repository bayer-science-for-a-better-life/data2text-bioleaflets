CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nVoriconazole Accord, is a broad spectrum, triazole antifungal agent and is indicated in adults and \n\nchildren aged 2 years and above as follows: \n\n \n\nTreatment of invasive aspergillosis. \n\n \n\nTreatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients. \n\n \n\nTreatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei). \n\n \n\nTreatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. \n\n \n\nVoriconazole Accord should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-\n\nthreatening infections. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant \n\n(HSCT) recipients. \n\n \n\n\n\n3  \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nElectrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be \n\nmonitored and corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nVoriconazole may also be available as powder for solution for infusion, powder and solvent for \n\nsolution for infusion and powder for oral suspension, however not under this tradename. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\n \n\nAdults  \n\nTherapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of either intravenous or oral \n\nvoriconazole to achieve plasma concentrations on Day 1 that are close to steady state. On the basis of \n\nthe high oral bioavailability (96 %; see section 5.2), switching between intravenous and oral \n\nadministration is appropriate when clinically indicated.  \n\n \n\nDetailed information on dosage recommendations is provided in the following table: \n\n \n\n Intravenous Oral \n\nPatients 40 kg and \n\nabove* \n\nPatients less than 40 kg* \n\nLoading dose \n\nregimen \n\n(first 24 hours) \n\n6 mg/kg every 12 \n\nhours \n\n400 mg every 12 hours 200 mg every 12 hours \n\nMaintenance dose \n\n(after first 24 \n\nhours) \n\n4 mg/kg twice \n\ndaily \n\n200 mg twice daily 100 mg twice daily \n\n*This also applies to patients aged 15 years and older. \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment  \n\nTreatment duration should be as short as possible depending on the patient\u2019s clinical and \n\nmycological response. Long term exposure to voriconazole greater than 180 days (6 months) \n\nrequires careful assessment of the benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nDosage adjustment (Adults) \n\nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the maintenance dose may be increased to 300 mg twice \n\ndaily for oral administration. For patients less than 40 kg the oral dose may be increased to 150 mg \n\ntwice daily. \n\n \n\nIf patient is unable to tolerate treatment at a higher dose, reduce the oral dose by 50 mg steps to the \n\n200 mg twice daily (or 100 mg twice daily for patients less than 40 kg) maintenance dose. \n\n \n\nIn case of use as prophylaxis, refer below. \n\n \n\nChildren (2 to <12 years) and young adolescents with low body weight (12 to 14 years and <50 kg) \n\nVoriconazole should be dosed as children as these young adolescents may metabolize voriconazole \n\nmore similarly to children than to adults.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dosing regimen is as follows: \n\n \n\n Intravenous  Oral \n\nLoading Dose Regimen  \n\n(first 24 hours) \n\n9 mg/kg every 12 hours Not recommended \n\nMaintenance Dose 8 mg/kg twice daily  9 mg/kg twice daily  \n\n\n\n4  \n\n(after first 24 hours) (a maximum dose of 350 mg \n\ntwice daily) \n\nNote: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 112 immunocompromised paediatricpatients \n\naged 2 to <12 years and 26 immunocompromised adolescents aged 12 to <17 years.  \n\n \n\nIt is recommended to initiate the therapy with intravenous regimen, and oral regimen should be \n\nconsidered only after there is a significant clinical improvement. It should be noted that an 8 mg/kg \n\nintravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nThese oral dose recommendations for children are based on studies in which voriconazole was \n\nadministered as the powder for oral suspension. Bioequivalence between the powder for oral \n\nsuspension and tablets has not been investigated in a paediatric population. Considering the assumed \n\nlimited gastro-enteric transit time in paediatric patients, the absorption of tablets may be different in \n\npaediatric compared to adult patients. It is therefore recommended to use the oral suspension \n\nformulation in children aged  \n\n2 to <12.  \n\n \n\nAll other adolescents (12 to 14 years and \u226550 kg; 15 to 17 years regardless of body weight) \n\nVoriconazole should be dosed as adults. \n\n \n\nDosage adjustment (Children [2 to <12 years] and young adolescents with low body weight [12 to \n\n14 years and <50 kg]) \n\nIf patient response to treatment is inadequate, the dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps (or by \n\n50 mg steps if the maximum oral dose of 350 mg was used initially). If patient is unable to tolerate \n\ntreatment, reduce the dose by 1 mg/kg steps (or by 50 mg steps if the maximum oral dose of 350 mg \n\nwas used initially). \n\n \n\nUse in paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years with hepatic or renal insufficiency has not been studied \n\n(see sections 4.8 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nProphylaxis in adults and children \n\n \n\nProphylaxis should be initiated on the day of transplant and may be administered for up to 100 days. \n\nProphylaxis should be as short as possible depending on the risk for developing invasive fungal \n\ninfection (IFI) as defined by neutropenia or immunosuppression. It may only be continued up to \n\n180 days after transplantation in case of continuing immunosuppression or graft versus host disease \n\n(GvHD) (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nDosage  \n\nThe recommended dosing regimen for prophylaxis is the same as for treatment in the respective age \n\ngroups. Please refer to the treatment tables above. \n\n \n\nDuration of prophylaxis \n\nThe safety and efficacy of voriconazole use for longer than 180 days has not been adequately studied \n\nin clinical trials. \n\n \n\nUse of voriconazole in prophylaxis for greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful assessment of \n\nthe benefit-risk balance (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe following instructions apply to both treatment and prophylaxis \n\n \n\nDosage adjustment \n\nFor prophylaxis use, dose adjustments are not recommended in the case of lack of efficacy or \n\ntreatment-related adverse events. In the case of treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation of \n\nvoriconazole and use of alternative antifungal agents must be considered (see section 4.4 and 4.8) \n\n \n\n\n\n5  \n\nDosage adjustments in case of co-administration \n\nPhenytoin may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is \n\nincreased from 200 mg to 400 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients \n\nless than 40 kg), see sections 4.4 and 4.5. \n\n \n\nThe combination of voriconazole with rifabutin should, if possible be avoided. However, if the \n\ncombination is strictly needed, the maintenance dose of voriconazole may be increased from 200 mg \n\nto 350 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.5. \n\n \n\nEfavirenz may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is \n\nincreased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose is reduced by 50 %, i.e. to 300 mg once \n\ndaily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5)  \n\n \n\nElderly  \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of orally administered voriconazole are not affected by renal impairment. \n\nTherefore, no adjustment is necessary for oral dosing for patients with mild to severe renal impairment \n\n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. A 4 hour haemodialysis session does \n\nnot remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIt is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be \n\nhalved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) receiving \n\nvoriconazole (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nVoriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe chronic hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C). \n\n \n\nThere is limited data on the safety of voriconazole in patients with abnormal liver function tests \n\n(aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], or total \n\nbilirubin >5 times the upper limit of normal). \n\n \n\nVoriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver \n\ndamage, such as jaundice, and must only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the \n\nbenefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with severe hepatic impairment must be carefully \n\nmonitored for drug toxicity (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of voriconazole in children below 2 years has not been established. Currently \n\navailable data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be \n\nmade. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nVoriconazole Accord film-coated tablets are to be taken at least one hour before, or one hour \n\nfollowing, a meal. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n6  \n\nCoadministration with CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine \n\nsince increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and \n\nrare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCoadministration with rifampicin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital since these medicinal products \n\nare likely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCoadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg once daily or \n\nhigher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole \n\nconcentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz \n\nplasma concentrations (see section 4.5, for lower doses see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCoadministration with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg and above twice daily) because ritonavir \n\nsignificantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at this dose (see \n\nsection 4.5, for lower doses see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCoadministration with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine), which are CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrates, since increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to ergotism (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nCoadministration with sirolimus since voriconazole is likely to increase plasma concentrations of \n\nsirolimus significantly (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCoadministration with St John\u2019s Wort (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\n \n\nCaution should be used in prescribing Voriconazole Accord to patients with hypersensitivity to other \n\nazoles (see also section 4.8). \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\n \n\nVoriconazole has been associated with QTc interval prolongation. There have been rare cases of \n\ntorsades de pointes in patients taking voriconazole who had risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic \n\nchemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalaemia and concomitant medicinal products that may have \n\nbeen contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially \n\nproarrhythmic conditions, such as: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Congenital or acquired QTc -prolongation. \n\n\uf0b7 Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present. \n\n\uf0b7 Sinus bradycardia. \n\n\uf0b7 Existing symptomatic arrhythmias. \n\n\uf0b7 Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QTc interval. Electrolyte disturbances \nsuch as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored and \n\ncorrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.2). A \n\nstudy has been conducted in healthy volunteers which examined the effect on QTc interval of \n\nsingle doses of voriconazole up to 4 times the usual daily dose. No subject experienced an \n\ninterval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nHepatic toxicity \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, there have been cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole \n\n(including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of \n\nhepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions \n\n(predominantly haematological malignancy).Transient hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and \n\n\n\n7  \n\njaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has \n\nusually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nMonitoring of hepatic function \n\n \n\nPatients receiving Voriconazole Accord must be carefully monitored for hepatic toxicity. Clinical \n\nmanagement should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (specifically AST and ALT) at \n\nthe initiation of treatment with Voriconazole Accord and at least weekly for the first month of \n\ntreatment. Treatment duration should be as short as possible; however, if based on the benefit-risk \n\nassessment the treatment is continued (see section 4.2), monitoring frequency can be reduced to \n\nmonthly if there are no changes in the liver function tests.  \n\n \n\nIf the liver function tests become markedly elevated, Voriconazole Accord should be discontinued, \n\nunless the medical judgment of the risk-benefit of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use.  \n\n \n\nMonitoring of hepatic function should be carried out in both children and adults. \n\n \n\nSerious dermatological adverse reactions \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Phototoxicity \nIn addition Voriconazole Accord has been associated with phototoxicity including reactions such as \n\nephelides, lentigo, actinic keratosis and pseudoporphyria. It is recommended that all patients, \n\nincluding children, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during Voriconazole Accord treatment and use \n\nmeasures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) \nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin has been reported in patients, some of whom have reported prior \n\nphototoxic reactions. If phototoxic reactions occur multidisciplinary advice should be sought, \n\nVoriconazole Accord discontinuation and use of alternative antifungal agents should be considered \n\nand the patient should be referred to a dermatologist. If Voriconazole Accord is continued, however, \n\ndermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis, to allow early \n\ndetection and management of premalignant lesions. Voriconazole Accord should be discontinued if \n\npremalignant skin lesions or squamous cell carcinoma are identified (see below the section under \n\nLong-term treatment). \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Exfoliative cutaneous reactions \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome \n\n(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \n\nsymptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported with the use \n\nof voriconazole. If a patient develops a rash he should be monitored closely and Voriconazole Accord \n\ndiscontinued if lesions progress. \n\n \n\nLong-term treatment \n\n \n\nLong term exposure (treatment or prophylaxis) greater than 180 days (6 months) requires careful \n\nassessment of the benefit-risk balance and physicians should therefore consider the need to limit the \n\nexposure to Voriconazole Accord (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) has been reported in relation with long-term Voriconazole \n\nAccord treatment. \n\n \n\nNon-infectious periostitis with elevated fluoride and alkaline phosphatase levels has been reported in \n\ntransplant patients. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with \n\nperiostitis Voriconazole Accord discontinuation should be considered after multidisciplinary advice. \n\n \n\nVisual adverse reactions \n\n \n\n\n\n8  \n\nThere have been reports of prolonged visual adverse reactions, including blurred vision, optic neuritis \n\nand papilloedema (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nRenal adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAcute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. \n\nPatients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic \n\nmedicinal products and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nMonitoring of renal function \n\n \n\nPatients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include \n\nlaboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. \n\n \n\nMonitoring of pancreatic function \n\n \n\nPatients, especially children, with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, \n\nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]), should be monitored closely during Voriconazole \n\nAccord treatment. Monitoring of serum amylase or lipase may be considered in this clinical situation. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nSafety and effectiveness in paediatric subjects below the age of two years has not been established (see \n\nsections 4.8 and 5.1). Voriconazole is indicated for paediatric patients aged two years or older. A \n\nhigher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the paediatric population (see \n\nsection 4.8). Hepatic function should be monitored in both children and adults. Oral bioavailability \n\nmay be limited in paediatric patients aged 2-<12 years with malabsorption and very low body weight \n\nfor age. In that case, intravenous voriconazole administration is recommended. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Serious dermatological adverse reactions (including SCC) \n \n\nThe frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the paediatric population. As an evolution \n\ntowards SCC has been reported, stringent measures for the photoprotection are warranted in this \n\npopulation of patients. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, \n\nsun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nProphylaxis \n\n \n\nIn case of treatment-related adverse events (hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions including \n\nphototoxicity and SCC, severe or prolonged visual disorders and periostitis), discontinuation of \n\nvoriconazole and use of alternative antifungal agents must be considered. \n\n \n\nPhenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate and potent CYP450 inducer) \n\n \n\nCareful monitoring of phenytoin levels is recommended when phenytoin is coadministered with \n\nvoriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole and phenytoin should be avoided unless the benefit \n\noutweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nEfavirenz (CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) \n\n \n\nWhen voriconazole is coadministered with efavirenz the dose of voriconazole should be increased to \n\n400 mg every 12 hours and the dose of efavirenz should be decreased to 300 mg every 24 hours (see \n\nsections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nRifabutin (Potent CYP450 inducer) \n\n \n\n\n\n9  \n\nCareful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions to rifabutin (e.g. uveitis) is \n\nrecommended when rifabutin is coadministered with voriconazole. Concomitant use of voriconazole \n\nand rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nRitonavir (potent CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) \n\n \n\nCoadministration of voriconazole and low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) should be avoided \n\nunless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole (see sections 4.3 \n\nand 4.5). \n\n \n\nEverolimus (CYP3A4 substrate, P-gp substrate)  \n\n \n\nCoadministration of voriconazole with everolimus is not recommended because voriconazole is \n\nexpected to significantly increase everolimus concentrations. Currently there are insufficient data to \n\nallow dosing recommendations in this situation (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nMethadone (CYP3A4 substrate) \n\n \n\nFrequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to methadone, including QTc \n\nprolongation, is recommended when coadministered with voriconazole since methadone levels \n\nincreased following coadministration of voriconazole. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nShort-acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate) \n\n \n\nReduction in the dose of alfentanil, fentanyl and other short-acting opiates similar in structure to \n\nalfentanil and metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered \n\nwith voriconazole (see section 4.5). As the half-life of alfentanil is prolonged in a 4-fold manner when \n\nalfentanil is coadministered with voriconazole, and in an independent published study concomitant use \n\nof voriconazole with fentanyl resulted in an increase in the mean AUC0-\u221e of fentanyl, frequent \n\nmonitoring for opiate-associated adverse reactions (including a longer respiratory monitoring period) \n\nmay be necessary. \n\n \n\nLong-acting opiates (CYP3A4 substrate) \n\n \n\nReduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., \n\nhydrocodone) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Frequent monitoring for \n\nopiate-associated adverse reactions may be necessary (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nFluconazole(CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor) \n\n \n\nCoadministration of oral voriconazole and oral fluconazole resulted in a significant increase in Cmax \n\nand AUC\u03c4 of voriconazole in healthy subjects. The reduced dose and/or frequency of voriconazole and \n\nfluconazole that would eliminate this effect have not been established. Monitoring for \n\nvoriconazole-associated adverse reactions is recommended if voriconazole is used sequentially after \n\nfluconazole (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nVoriconazole Accord tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary \n\nproblems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nVoriconazole is metabolised by, and inhibits the activity of, cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C19, \n\nCYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Inhibitors or inducers of these isoenzymes may increase or decrease \n\nvoriconazole plasma concentrations, respectively, and there is potential for voriconazole to increase \n\nthe plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these CYP450 isoenzymes. \n\n \n\n\n\n10  \n\nUnless otherwise specified, drug interaction studies have been performed in healthy adult male \n\nsubjects using multiple dosing to steady state with oral voriconazole at 200 mg twice daily (BID). \n\nThese results are relevant to other populations and routes of administration. \n\n \n\nVoriconazole should be administered with caution in patients with concomitant medication that is \n\nknown to prolong QTc interval. When there is also a potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma \n\nconcentrations of substances metabolised by CYP3A4 isoenzymes (certain antihistamines, quinidine, \n\ncisapride, pimozide), coadministration is contraindicated (see below and section 4.3). \n\n \n\nInteraction table \n\n \n\nInteractions between voriconazole and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (once \n\ndaily as \u201cQD\u201d, twice daily as \u201cBID\u201d, three times daily as \u201cTID\u201d and not determined as \u201cND\u201d). The \n\ndirection of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of \n\nthe geometric mean ratio being within (\u2194), below (\u2193) or above (\u2191) the 80-125% range.

These visual impairments were transient and fully \n\nreversible, with the majority spontaneously resolving within 60 minutes and no clinically significant \n\nlong-term visual effects were observed. There was evidence of attenuation with repeated doses of \n\nvoriconazole. The visual impairments were generally mild, rarely resulted in discontinuation and were \n\nnot associated with long-term sequelae. Visual impairments may be associated with higher plasma \n\nconcentrations and/or doses. \n\n \n\nThe mechanism of action is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. \n\nIn a study in healthy volunteers investigating the impact of voriconazole on retinal function, \n\nvoriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude. The ERG \n\nmeasures electrical currents in the retina. The ERG changes did not progress over 29 days of treatment \n\nand were fully reversible on withdrawal of voriconazole. \n\n \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDermatological reactions \n\n\n\n20  \n\nDermatological reactions were very common in patients treated with voriconazole in clinical trials, but \n\nthese patients had serious underlying diseases and were receiving multiple concomitant medicinal \n\nproducts. The majority of rashes were of mild to moderate severity. Patients have developed severe \n\ncutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (uncommon), toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) (rare), drug reaction with \n\neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (rare) and erythema multiforme (rare) during treatment \n\nwith voriconazole (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIf a patient develops a rash they should be monitored closely and Voriconazole Accord discontinued if \n\nlesions progress. Photosensitivity reactions such as ephelides, lentigo and actinic keratosis have been \n\nreported, especially during long-term therapy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in patients treated with Voriconazole \n\nAccord for long periods of time; the mechanism has not been established (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLiver function tests \n\nThe overall incidence of transaminase increases>3xULN (not necessarily comprising an adverse \n\nevent) in the voriconazole clinical programme was 18.0% (319/1,768) in adults and 25.8% (73/283) in \n\npaediatric subjects who received voriconazole for pooled therapeutic and prophylaxis use. Liver \n\nfunction test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The \n\nmajority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or \n\nfollowing dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. \n\n \n\nVoriconazole has been associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity in patients with other serious \n\nunderlying conditions. This includes cases of jaundice, hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nProphylaxis \n\nIn an open-label, comparative, multicenter study comparing voriconazole and itraconazole as primary \n\nprophylaxis in adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI, \n\npermanent discontinuation of voriconazole due to AEs was reported in 39.3% of subjects versus \n\n39.6% of subjects in the itraconazole arm. Treatment-emergent hepatic AEs resulted in permanent \n\ndiscontinuation of study medication for 50 subjects (21.4%) treated with voriconazole and for 18 \n\nsubjects (7.1%) treated with itraconazole. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety of voriconazole was investigated in 288 paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years (169) and \n\n12 to<18 years (119) who received voriconazole for prophylaxis (183) and therapeutic use (105) in \n\nclinical trials. The safety of voriconazole was also investigated in 158 additional paediatric patients \n\naged 2 to <12 years in compassionate use programs. Overall, the safety profile of voriconazole in \n\npaediatric population was similar to that in adults. However, a trend towards a higher frequency of \n\nliver enzyme elevations, reported as adverse events in clinical trials was observed in paediatric \n\npatients as compared to adults (14.2% transaminases increased in paediatrics compared to 5.3% in \n\nadults). Post-marketing data suggest there might be a higher occurrence of skin reactions (especially \n\nerythema) in the paediatric population compared to adults. In the 22 patients less than 2 years old who \n\nreceived voriconazole in a compassionate use programme, the following adverse reactions (for which \n\na relationship to voriconazole could not be excluded) were reported: photosensitivity reaction (1), \n\narrhythmia (1), pancreatitis(1), blood bilirubin increased (1), hepatic enzymes increased (1), rash (1) \n\nand papilloedema (1). There have been post-marketing reports of pancreatitis in paediatric patients. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21  \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials there were 3 cases of accidental overdose. All occurred in paediatric patients, who \n\nreceived up to five times the recommended intravenous dose of voriconazole. A single adverse \n\nreaction of photophobia of 10 minutes duration was reported. \n\n \n\nThere is no known antidote to voriconazole. \n\n \n\nVoriconazole is haemodialysed with a clearance of 121 ml/min. In an overdose, haemodialysis may \n\nassist in the removal of voriconazole from the body. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives, ATC code: J02A C03 \n\n \n\nMode of action \n\n \n\nVoriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. The primary mode of action of voriconazole is the \n\ninhibition of fungal cytochrome P450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylation, an essential step in \n\nfungal ergosterol biosynthesis. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the \n\nsubsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane and may be responsible for the antifungal \n\nactivity of voriconazole. Voriconazole has been shown to be more selective for fungal cytochrome P-\n\n450 enzymes than for various mammalian cytochrome P-450 enzyme systems. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n\n \n\nIn 10 therapeutic studies, the median for the average and maximum plasma concentrations in \n\nindividual subjects across the studies was 2425 ng/ml (inter-quartile range 1193 to 4380 ng/ml) and \n\n3742 ng/ml (inter-quartile range 2027 to 6302 ng/ml), respectively. A positive association between \n\nmean, maximum or minimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy in therapeutic studies \n\nwas not found and this relationship has not been explored in prophylaxis studies. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic analyses of clinical trial data identified positive associations \n\nbetween plasma voriconazole concentrations and both liver function test abnormalities and visual \n\ndisturbances. Dose adjustments in prophylaxis studies have not been explored. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nIn vitro, voriconazole displays broad-spectrum antifungal activity with antifungal potency against \n\nCandida species (including fluconazole resistant C. krusei and resistant strains of C. glabrata and C. \n\nalbicans) and fungicidal activity against all Aspergillus species tested. In addition voriconazole shows \n\nin vitro fungicidal activity against emerging fungal pathogens, including those such as Scedosporium \n\nor Fusarium which have limited susceptibility to existing antifungal agents. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy defined as partial or complete response, has been demonstrated for Aspergillus spp. \n\nincluding A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. niger, A. nidulans, Candida spp., including C. \n\nalbicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis and limited numbers of C. \n\ndubliniensis, C. inconspicua, and C. guilliermondii, Scedosporium spp., including S. apiospermum, S. \n\nprolificans and Fusarium spp. \n\n \n\nOther treated fungal infections (often with either partial or complete response) included isolated cases \n\nof Alternaria spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Blastoschizomyces capitatus, Cladosporium spp., \n\nCoccidioides immitis, Conidiobolus coronatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Exserohilum rostratum, \n\nExophiala spinifera, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Madurella mycetomatis, Paecilomyces lilacinus, \n\n\n\n22  \n\nPenicillium spp. including P. marneffei, Phialophora richardsiae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and \n\nTrichosporon spp. includingT. beigelii infections. \n\n \n\nIn vitro activity against clinical isolates has been observed for Acremonium spp., Alternaria spp., \n\nBipolaris spp., Cladophialophora spp., and Histoplasma capsulatum, with most strains being inhibited \n\nby concentrations of voriconazole in the range 0.05 to 2 \u03bcg/ml. \n\n \n\nIn vitro activity against the following pathogens has been shown, but the clinical significance is \n\nunknown: Curvularia spp. and Sporothrix spp. \n\n \n\nBreakpoints \n\nSpecimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should \n\nbe obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted \n\nbefore the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results \n\nbecome available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly. \n\n \n\nThe species most frequently involved in causing human infections include C. albicans, C. \n\nparapsilosis, C.tropicalis, C. glabrata andC. krusei, all of which usually exhibit minimal inhibitory \n\nconcentration (MICs) of less than 1 mg/L for voriconazole. \n\n \n\nHowever, the in vitro activity of voriconazole against Candida species is not uniform. Specifically, for \n\nC. glabrata, the MICs of voriconazole for fluconazole-resistant isolates are proportionally higher than \n\nare those of fluconazole-susceptible isolates. Therefore, every attempt should be made to identify \n\nCandida to species level. If antifungal susceptibility testing is available, the MIC results may be \n\ninterpreted using breakpoint criteria established by European Committee on Antimicrobial \n\nSusceptibility Testing (EUCAST). \n\n \n\nEUCAST Breakpoints \n\n \n\nCandida species MIC breakpoint (mg/L) \n\n\u2264S (Susceptible) >R (Resistant) \n\nCandida albicans1 0.125 0.125 \n\nCandida tropicalis1 0.125 0.125 \n\nCandida parapsilosis1 0.125 0.125 \n\nCandida glabrata2  Insufficient evidence \n\nCandida krusei3  Insufficient evidence \n\nOther Candida spp.4 Insufficient evidence \n1 Strains with MIC values above the Susceptible (S) breakpoint are rare, or not yet reported. The \n\nidentification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests on any such isolate must be repeated and if the \n\nresult is confirmed the isolate sent to a reference laboratory. \n2 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in patients with C glabrata infections was 21% lower \n\ncompared to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. In vitro data showed a slight increase of \n\nresistance of C. glabrata to voriconazole. \n3 In clinical studies, response to voriconazole in C. krusei infections was similar to C. albicans, C. \n\nparapsilosis and C. tropicalis. However, as there were only 9 cases available for EUCAST analysis, \n\nthere is currently insufficient evidence to set clinical breakpoints for C. krusei. \n4 EUCAST has not determined non-species related breakpoints for voriconazole. \n\n \n\nClinical experience \n\n \n\nSuccessful outcome in this section is defined as complete or partial response. \n\n \n\nAspergillus infections \u2013 efficacy in aspergillosis patients with poor prognosis  \n\n \n\nVoriconazole has in vitro fungicidal activity against Aspergillus spp. The efficacy and survival benefit \n\nof voriconazole versus conventional amphotericin B in the primary treatment of acute invasive \n\naspergillosis was demonstrated in an open, randomised, multicentre study in 277immunocompromised \n\n\n\n23  \n\npatients treated for 12 weeks. Voriconazole was administered intravenously with a loading dose of \n\n6 mg/kg every 12 hours for the first 24 hours followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 \n\nhours for a minimum of 7 days. Therapy could then be switched to the oral formulation at a dose of \n\n200 mg every 12 hours. Median duration of IV voriconazole therapy was 10 days (range 2-85 days). \n\nAfter IV voriconazole therapy, the median duration of oral voriconazole therapy was 76 days (range 2-\n\n232days). \n\n \n\nA satisfactory global response (complete or partial resolution of all attributable symptoms, signs, \n\nradiographic/bronchoscopic abnormalities present at baseline) was seen in 53% of voriconazole-\n\ntreated patients compared to 31% of patients treated with comparator. The 84-day survival rate for \n\nvoriconazole was statistically significantly higher than that for the comparator and a clinically and \n\nstatistically significant benefit was shown in favour of voriconazole for both time to death and time to \n\ndiscontinuation due to toxicity. \n\n \n\nThis study confirmed findings from an earlier, prospectively designed study where there was a \n\npositive outcome in subjects with risk factors for a poor prognosis, including graft versus host disease, \n\nand, in particular, cerebral infections (normally associated with almost 100% mortality). \n\n \n\nThe studies included cerebral, sinus, pulmonary and disseminated aspergillosis in patients with bone \n\nmarrow and solid organ transplants, haematological malignancies, cancer and AIDS. \n\n \n\nCandidaemia in non-neutropenic patients \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of voriconazole compared to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in \n\nthe primary treatment of candidaemia was demonstrated in an open, comparative study. Three hundred \n\nand seventy non-neutropenic patients (above 12 years of age) with documented candidaemia were \n\nincluded in the study, of whom 248 were treated with voriconazole. Nine subjects in the voriconazole \n\ngroup and 5 in the amphotericin B followed by fluconazole group also had mycologically proven \n\ninfection in deep tissue. Patients with renal failure were excluded from this study. The median \n\ntreatment duration was 15 days in both treatment arms. In the primary analysis, successful response as \n\nassessed by a Data Review Committee (DRC) blinded to study medicinal product was defined as \n\nresolution/improvement in all clinical signs and symptoms of infection with eradication of Candida \n\nfrom blood and infected deep tissue sites 12 weeks after the end of therapy (EOT). Patients who did \n\nnot have an assessment 12 weeks after EOT were counted as failures. In this analysis a successful \n\nresponse was seen in 41 % of patients in both treatment arms. \n\n \n\nIn a secondary analysis, which utilised DRC assessments at the latest evaluable time point (EOT, or 2, \n\n6, or 12 weeks after EOT) voriconazole and the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole \n\nhad successful response rates of 65% and 71%, respectively. The Investigator\u2019s assessment of \n\nsuccessful outcome at each of these time points is shown in the following table. \n\n \n\nTimepoint Voriconazole \n\n(N=248) \n\nAmphotericin B \n\n\u2192 fluconazole \n\n(N=122) \n\nEOT 178 (72%) 88 (72%) \n\n2 weeks after EOT 125 (50%) 62 (51%) \n\n6 weeks after EOT 104 (42%) 55 (45%) \n\n12 weeks after EOT 104 (42%) 51 (42%) \n\n \n\nSerious refractory Candida infections \n\n \n\nThe study comprised 55 patients with serious refractory systemic Candida infections (including \n\ncandidaemia, disseminated and other invasive candidiasis) where prior antifungal treatment, \n\nparticularly with fluconazole, had been ineffective. Successful response was seen in 24 patients (15 \n\ncomplete, 9 partial responses). In fluconazole-resistant non albicans species, a successful outcome was \n\n\n\n24  \n\nseen in3/3 C.krusei (complete responses) and 6/8 C. glabrata (5 complete, 1 partial response) \n\ninfections. The clinical efficacy data were supported by limited susceptibility data. \n\n \n\nScedosporium and Fusarium infections \n\n \n\nVoriconazole was shown to be effective against the following rare fungal pathogens: \n\n \n\nScedosporium spp \n\nSuccessful response to voriconazole therapy was seen in 16 (6 complete, 10 partial responses) of 28 \n\npatients with S. apiospermum and in 2 (both partial responses) of 7 patients with S. prolificans \n\ninfection. In addition, a successful response was seen in 1 of 3 patients with infections caused by more \n\nthan one organism including Scedosporium spp. \n\n \n\nFusarium spp \n\nSeven (3 complete, 4 partial responses) of 17 patients were successfully treated with voriconazole. Of \n\nthese 7 patients, 3 had eye, 1 had sinus, and 3 had disseminated infection. Four additional patients with \n\nfusariosis had an infection caused by several organisms; 2 of them had a successful outcome. \n\n \n\nThe majority of patients receiving voriconazole treatment of the above mentioned rare infections were \n\nintolerant of, or refractory to, prior antifungal therapy. \n\n \n\nPrimary Prophylaxis of Invasive Fungal Infections \u2013 Efficacy in HSCT recipients without prior proven \n\nor probable IFI \n\n \n\nVoriconazole was compared to itraconazole as primary prophylaxis in an open-label, comparative, \n\nmulticenter study of adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable \n\nIFI. Success was defined as the ability to continue study drug prophylaxis for 100 days after HSCT \n\n(without stopping for >14 days) and survival with no proven or probable IFI for 180days after HSCT. \n\nThe modified intent-to-treat (MITT) group included 465 allogeneic HSCT recipients with 45% of \n\npatients having AML. From all patients 58% were subject to myeloablative conditions regimens. \n\nProphylaxis with study drug was started immediately after HSCT: 224 received voriconazole and 241 \n\nreceived itraconazole. The median duration of study drug prophylaxis was 96 days for voriconazole \n\nand 68 days for itraconazole in the MITT group. \n\n \n\nSuccess rates and other secondary endpoints are presented in the table below: \n\n \n\nStudy Endpoints Voriconazo\n\nle \n\nN=224 \n\nItraconazo\n\nle \n\nN=241 \n\nDifference in \n\nproportions and the \n\n95% confidence \n\ninterval (CI)  \n\nP-\n\nValue \n\nSuccess at day 180* 109 (48.7%) 80 (33.2%) 16.4% (7.7%, \n\n25.1%)** \n\n0.0002\n\n** \n\nSuccess at day 100  121 (54.0%) 96 (39.8%) 15.4% (6.6%, \n\n24.2%)** \n\n0.0006\n\n** \n\nCompleted at least 100 days of \n\nstudy drug prophylaxis  \n\n120 (53.6%) 94 (39.0%) 14.6% (5.6%, 23.5%) 0.0015 \n\nSurvived to day 180 184 (82.1%) 197 \n\n(81.7%) \n\n0.4% (-6.6%, 7.4%) 0.9107 \n\nDeveloped proven or probable \n\nIFI to day 180 \n\n3 (1.3%) 5 (2.1%) -0.7% (-3.1%, 1.6%) 0.5390 \n\nDeveloped proven or probable \n\nIFI to day 100 \n\n2 (0.9%) 4 (1.7%) -0.8% (-2.8%, 1.3%) 0.4589 \n\nDeveloped proven or probable \n\nIFI while on study drug \n\n0 3 (1.2%) -1.2% (-2.6%, 0.2%) 0.0813 \n\n* Primary endpoint of the study \n\n** Difference in proportions, 95% CI and p-values obtained after adjustment for randomization \n\n \n\n\n\n25  \n\nThe breakthrough IFI rate to Day 180 and the primary endpoint of the study, which is Success at Day \n\n180, for patients with AML and myeloablative conditioning regimens respectively, is presented in the \n\ntable below: \n\n \n\nAML \n \n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazo\n\nle  \n\n(N=98)  \n\n  \n\nItraconazo\n\nle \n\n(N=109) \n\nDifference in proportions \n\nand the 95% confidence \n\ninterval (CI) \n\nBreakthrough IFI \u2013 Day \n\n180 \n\n1 (1.0%)  2 (1.8%) -0.8% (-4.0%, 2.4%) ** \n\nSuccess at Day 180* 55 (56.1%) 45 (41.3%) 14.7% (1.7%, 27.7%)*** \n\n* Primary endpoint of study \n\n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated  \n\n***Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization \n\n \n\nMyeloablative conditioning regimens \n\n \n\nStudy endpoints Voriconazo\n\nle  \n\n(N=125)  \n\n  \n\nItraconazo\n\nle \n\n(N=143) \n\nDifference in proportions \n\nand the 95% confidence \n\ninterval (CI) \n\nBreakthrough IFI \u2013 Day \n\n180 \n\n2 (1.6%) 3 (2.1%)  -0.5% (-3.7%, 2.7%) ** \n\nSuccess at Day 180* 70 (56.0%) 53 (37.1%) 20.1% (8.5%, 31.7%)*** \n\n* Primary endpoint of study \n\n** Using a margin of 5%, non inferiority is demonstrated  \n\n*** Difference in proportions, 95% CI obtained after adjustment for randomization  \n\n \n\nSecondary Prophylaxis of IFI \u2013 Efficacy in HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI \n\n \n\nVoriconazole was investigated as secondary prophylaxis in an open-label, non-comparative, \n\nmulticenter study of adult allogeneic HSCT recipients with prior proven or probable IFI. The primary \n\nendpoint was the rate of occurrence of proven and probable IFI during the first year after HSCT. The \n\nMITT group included 40 patients with prior IFI, including 31 with aspergillosis, 5 with candidiasis, \n\nand 4 with other IFI. The median duration of study drug prophylaxis was 95.5 days in the MITT \n\ngroup. \n\n \n\nProven or probable IFIs developed in 7.5% (3/40) of patients during the first year after HSCT, \n\nincluding one candidemia, one scedosporiosis (both relapses of prior IFI), and one zygomycosis. The \n\nsurvival rate at Day 180 was 80.0% (32/40) and at 1 year was 70.0% (28/40). \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, 705 patients received voriconazole therapy for greater than 12 weeks, with 164 \n\npatients receiving voriconazole for over 6 months. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nFifty-three paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years were treated with voriconazole in two prospective, \n\nopen-label, non-comparative, multi-center clinical trials. One study enrolled 31 patients with possible, \n\nproven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA), of whom 14 patients had proven or probable IA and \n\nwere included in the MITT efficacy analyses. The second study enrolled 22 patients with invasive \n\ncandidiasis including candidaemia (ICC), and esophageal candidiasis (EC) requiring either primary or \n\nsalvage therapy, of whom 17 were included in the MITT efficacy analyses. For patients with IA the \n\noverall rates of global response at 6 weeks were 64.3% (9/14), the global response rate was 40% (2/5) \n\n\n\n26  \n\nfor patients 2 to <12 years and 77.8% (7/9) for patients 12 to <18 years of age. For patients with ICC \n\nthe global response rate at EOT was 85.7% (6/7) and for patients with EC the global response rate at \n\nEOT was 70% (7/10). The overall rate of response (ICC and EC combined) was 88.9% (8/9) for 2 to \n\n<12 years old and 62.5% (5/8) for 12 to <18 years old. \n\n \n\nClinical studies examining QTc interval \n\n \n\nA placebo-controlled, randomized, single-dose, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QTc \n\ninterval of healthy volunteers was conducted with three oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole. \n\nThe placebo- adjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800, 1200 and 1600 mg of \n\nvoriconazole were 5.1, 4.8, and 8.2 msec, respectively and 7.0 msec for ketoconazole 800 mg. No \n\nsubject in any group had an increase in QTc of \u226560 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an \n\ninterval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nGeneral pharmacokinetic characteristics \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole have been characterised in healthy subjects, special populations \n\nand patients. During oral administration of 200 mg or 300 mg twice daily for 14 days in patients at risk \n\nof aspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or haematopoietic tissue), the \n\nobserved pharmacokinetic characteristics of rapid and consistent absorption, accumulation and non-\n\nlinear pharmacokinetics were in agreement with those observed in healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are non-linear due to saturation of its metabolism. Greater than \n\nproportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, \n\nincreasing the oral dose from 200 mg twice daily to 300 mg twice daily leads to a 2.5-fold increase in \n\nexposure (AUC\u03c4).The oral maintenance dose of 200 mg (or 100 mg for patients less than 40 kg) \n\nachieves a voriconazole exposure similar to 3 mg/kg IV. A 300 mg (or 150 mg for patients less than \n\n40 kg) oral maintenance dose achieves an exposure similar to 4 mg/kg IV. When the recommended \n\nintravenous or oral loading dose regimens are administered, plasma concentrations close to steady state \n\nare achieved within the first 24 hours of dosing. Without the loading dose, accumulation occurs during \n\ntwice daily multiple dosing with steady-state plasma voriconazole concentrations being achieved by \n\nDay 6 in the majority of subjects. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nVoriconazole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration, with maximum \nplasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved 1-2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of \n\nvoriconazole after oral administration is estimated to be 96%.When multiple doses of voriconazole are \n\nadministered with high fat meals, Cmax and AUC\u03c4 are reduced by 34 % and 24 %, respectively. The \n\nabsorption of voriconazole is not affected by changes in gastric pH. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution at steady state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting \n\nextensive distribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58%. Cerebrospinal fluid \n\nsamples from eight patients in a compassionate programme showed detectable voriconazole \n\nconcentrations in all patients. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies showed that voriconazole is metabolised by, the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \n\nCYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. \n\n \n\nThe inter-individual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. \n\n \n\n\n\n27  \n\nIn vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. \n\nThis enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism. For example, 15-20 % of Asian populations may be \n\nexpected to be poor metabolisers. For Caucasians and Blacks the prevalence of poor metabolisers is \n\n3-5 %. Studies conducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor \nmetabolisers have, on average, 4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUC\u03c4) than their homozygous \n\nextensive metaboliser counterparts. Subjects who are heterozygous extensive metabolisers have on \n\naverage 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure than their homozygous extensive metaboliser \n\ncounterparts. \n\n \n\nThe major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulating \n\nradiolabeled metabolites in plasma. This metabolite has minimal antifungal activity and does not \n\ncontribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nVoriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged \n\nin the urine. \n\n \n\nAfter administration of a radiolabelled dose of voriconazole, approximately 80% of the radioactivity is \n\nrecovered in the urine after multiple intravenous dosing and 83% in the urine after multiple oral \n\ndosing. The majority (>94%) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral \n\nand intravenous dosing. \n\n \n\nThe terminal half-life of voriconazole depends on dose and is approximately 6 hours at 200 mg \n\n(orally). Because of non-linear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life is not useful in the prediction of \n\nthe accumulation or elimination of voriconazole. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n\n \n\nGender \n\nIn an oral multiple dose study, Cmax and AUC\u03c4 for healthy young females were 83% and 113% higher, \n\nrespectively, than in healthy young males (18-45years). In the same study, no significant differences in \nCmax and AUC\u03c4 were observed between healthy elderly males and healthy elderly females (\u226565 years). \n\n \n\nIn the clinical programme, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of gender. The safety profile \n\nand plasma concentrations observed in male and female patients were similar. Therefore, no dosage \n\nadjustment based on gender is necessary. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn an oral multiple-dose study Cmax and AUC\u03c4 in healthy elderly males (\u226565 years) were 61% and 86 \n\n% higher, respectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years). No significant differences in Cmax \nand AUC\u03c4   were observed between healthy elderly females (\u226565 years) and healthy young females \n\n(18-45 years). \n\n \n\nIn the therapeutic studies no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of age. A relationship between \n\nplasma concentrations and age was observed. The safety profile of voriconazole in young and elderly \n\npatients was similar and, therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe recommended doses in children and adolescent patients are based on a population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis of data obtained from 112 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged 2 to \n\n<12 years and 26 immunocompromised adolescent patients aged 12to <17 years. Multiple intravenous \n\ndoses of 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 mg/kg twice daily and multiple oral doses (using the powder for oral \n\nsuspension) of 4 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and 200 mg twice daily were evaluated in 3 paediatric \n\npharmacokinetic studies. Intravenous loading doses of 6 mg/kg IV twice daily on day 1 followed by 4 \n\nmg/kg intravenous dose twice daily and 300 mg oral tablets twice daily were evaluated in one \n\n\n\n28  \n\nadolescent pharmacokinetic study. Larger inter-subject variability was observed in paediatric patients \n\ncompared to adults. \n\n \n\nA comparison of the paediatric and adult population pharmacokinetic data indicated that the predicted \n\ntotal exposure (AUC\u03c4) in children following administration of a 9 mg/kg IV loading dose was \n\ncomparable to that in adults following a 6 mg/kg IV loading dose. The predicted total exposures in \n\nchildren following IV maintenance doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg twice daily were comparable to those in \n\nadults following 3 and 4 mg/kg IV twice daily, respectively. The predicted total exposure in children \n\nfollowing an oral maintenance dose of 9 mg/kg (maximum of 350 mg) twice daily was comparable to \n\nthat in adults following 200 mg oral twice daily. An 8 mg/kg intravenous dose will provide \n\nvoriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose. \n\n \n\nThe higher intravenous maintenance dose in paediatric patients relative to adults reflects the higher \n\nelimination capacity in paediatric patients due to a greater liver mass to body mass ratio. Oral \n\nbioavailability may, however, be limited in paediatric patients with malabsorption and very low body \n\nweight for their age. In that case, intravenous voriconazole administration is recommended. \n\n \n\nVoriconazole exposures in the majority of adolescent patients were comparable to those in adults \n\nreceiving the same dosing regimens. However, lower voriconazole exposure was observed in some \n\nyoung adolescents with low body weight compared to adults. It is likely that these subjects may \n\nmetabolize voriconazole more similarly to children than to adults. Based on the population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis, 12 to 14 year old adolescents weighing less than 50 kg should receive \n\nchildren\u2019s doses (sees ection4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn an oral single dose (200 mg) study in subjects with normal renal function and mild (creatinine \n\nclearance 41-60 ml/min) to severe (creatinine clearance < 20ml/min) renal impairment, the \n\npharmacokinetics of voriconazole were not significantly affected by renal impairment. The plasma \n\nprotein binding of voriconazole was similar in subjects with different degrees of renal impairment. (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nAfter an oral single-dose (200 mg), AUC was 233 % higher in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \n\ncirrhosis (Child-Pugh A and B) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Protein binding \n\nof voriconazole was not affected by impaired hepatic function. \n\n \nIn an oral multiple-dose study, AUC\u03c4 was similar in subjects with moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-\n\nPugh B) given a maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily and subjects with normal hepatic function \n\ngiven 200 mg twice daily. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe hepatic \n\ncirrhosis (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies with voriconazole indicated the liver to be the target organ. \n\nHepatotoxicity occurred at plasma exposures similar to those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, \n\nin common with other antifungal agents. In rats, mice and dogs, voriconazole also induced minimal \n\nadrenal changes. Conventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential \n\ndid not reveal a special hazard for humans. \n\n \n\nIn reproduction studies, voriconazole was shown to be teratogenic in rats and embryotoxic in rabbits at \n\nsystemic exposures equal to those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses. In the pre- and post-natal \n\ndevelopment study in rats at exposures lower than those obtained in humans with therapeutic doses, \n\nvoriconazole prolonged the duration of gestation and labour and produced dystocia with consequent \n\nmaternal mortality and reduced perinatal survival of pups. The effects on parturition are probably \n\nmediated by species-specific mechanisms, involving reduction of oestradiol levels, and are consistent \n\nwith those observed with other azole antifungal agents. Voriconazole administration induced no \n\n\n\n29  \n\nimpairment of male or female fertility in rats at exposures similar to those obtained in humans at \n\ntherapeutic doses. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

How to take Voriconazole Accord  \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will determine your dose depending on your weight and the type of infection you have. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose for adults (including elderly patients) is as follows: \n\n Tablets \n\nPatients 40 kg and above  Patients less than 40 kg \n\nDose for the first 24 hours \n\n(Loading Dose) \n\n400 mg every 12 hours  \n\nfor the first 24 hours \n\n200 mg every 12 hours \n\nfor the first 24 hours \n\nDose after the first 24 hours \n\n(Maintenance Dose) \n\n200 mg twice a day 100 mg twice a day \n\n \n\nDepending on your response to treatment, your doctor may increase the daily dose to 300 mg twice a \n\nday. \n\n \n\nThe doctor may decide to decrease the dose if you have mild to moderate cirrhosis. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose for children and teenagers is as follows: \n\n Tablets \n\n Children aged 2 to less than \n\n12 years and teenagers aged 12 to \n\n14 years weighing less than 50 kg \n\nTeenagers aged 12 to 14 years \n\nweighing 50 kg or more; and all \n\nteenagers older than 14 \n\nDose for the first 24 \n\nhours  \n\n(Loading Dose) \n\nYour treatment will be \n\nstarted as an infusion \n\n400 mg every 12 hours \n\nfor the first 24 hours \n\nDose after the first 24 \n\nhours \n\n(Maintenance Dose) \n\n9 mg/kg twice a day \n\n(a maximum dose of 350 mg \n\ntwice daily) \n\n200 mg twice a day \n\n \n\nDepending on your response to treatment, your doctor may increase or decrease the daily dose. \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Tablets must only be given if the child is able to swallow tablets. \n \n\nTake your tablet at least one hour before, or one hour after a meal. Swallow the tablet whole with \n\nsome water. \n\n \n\nIf you or your child are taking Voriconazole Accord for prevention of fungal infections, your doctor \n\nmay stop giving Voriconazole Accord if you or your child develop treatment related side effects. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Voriconazole Accord than you should \n\nIf you take more tablets than prescribed (or if someone else takes your tablets) you must seek medical \n\nadvice or go to the nearest hospital casualty department immediately.

Therefore unless your doctor instructs you to stop treatment, it is important to keep \n\ntaking Voriconazole Accord correctly, as described above. \n\n \n\nContinue taking Voriconazole Accord until your doctor tells you to stop.

related side effects. if you take more voriconazole accord than you should if you take more tablets than prescribed (or if someone else takes your tablets) you must seek medical advice or go to the nearest hospital casualty department immediately. take your box of voriconazole accord tablets with you. you may experience abnormal intolerance to light as a result of taking more voriconazole accord than you should. if you forget to take voriconazole accord it is important to take your voriconazole accord tablets regularly at the same time each day. if you forget to take one dose, take your next dose when it is due. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop taking voriconazole accord 49 it has been shown that taking all doses at the appropriate times may greatly increase the effectiveness of your medicine. therefore unless your doctor instructs you to stop treatment, it is important to keep taking voriconazole accord correctly, as described above. continue
