CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n\n \n\n4.1  Therapeutic indications  \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  \n\n• the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the \nresponse to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been \n\ninadequate.  \n\n• the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously \ntreated with methotrexate.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \n\ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nSOLYMBIC reduces the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by x-ray and improves \n\nphysical function, when given in combination with methotrexate.  \n\n \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis  \n\n \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of \n\nage and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy \n\n(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis  \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS)  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who \n\nhave had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without \n\nradiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, \n\nwho have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when \n\nthe response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. \n\nSOLYMBIC reduces the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by x-ray in \n\npatients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1) and improves physical \n\nfunction.  \n\n \n\nPsoriasis  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult \n\npatients who are candidates for systemic therapy.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and \n\nadolescents from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate \n\ncandidates for topical therapy and phototherapies. \n\n \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne \n\ninversa) in adult patients with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy. \n\n \n\nCrohn’s disease  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult \n\npatients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid \n\nand/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \n\ntherapies. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Crohn's disease  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in \n\npaediatric patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy \n\nincluding primary nutrition therapy, a corticosteroid, and an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant \n\nto or have contraindications for such therapies.  \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult \n\npatients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-\n\nmercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical \n\ncontraindications for such therapies. \n\n \n\nUveitis \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in \n\nadult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of \n\ncorticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. \n\n \n\n4.2  Posology and method of administration  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \n\ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which SOLYMBIC is indicated. Ophthalmologists are \n\nadvised to consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with SOLYMBIC (see \n\nsection 4.4). Patients treated with SOLYMBIC should be given the special alert card.  \n\n \n\nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with SOLYMBIC if their \n\nphysician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with SOLYMBIC, other concomitant therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or \n\nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of SOLYMBIC for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg \n\nadalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate \n\nshould be continued during treatment with SOLYMBIC.  \n\n \n\nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \n\nduring treatment with SOLYMBIC. Regarding combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \n\ndrugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n\n \n\nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response may benefit from an \n\nincrease in dose intensity to 40 mg adalimumab every week. \n\n \n\nAvailable adalimumab data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of \n\ntreatment. Continued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time \n\nperiod. \n\n \n\nDose interruption  \n\n \n\nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs.  \n\n \n\nRe-introduction of SOLYMBIC after discontinuation for 70 days or longer should result in the same \n\nmagnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose interruption. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic \n\narthritis  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of SOLYMBIC for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial \n\nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg \n\nadalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved \n\nwithin 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not \n\nresponding within this time period.  \n\n \n\nPsoriasis  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of SOLYMBIC for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \n\nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the \n\ninitial dose. \n\n \n\nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \n\nwithin this time period.  \n\n \n\nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response may benefit from an increase in dosing frequency \n\nto 40 mg every week. The benefits and risks of continued weekly therapy should be carefully \n\nreconsidered in a patient with an inadequate response after the increase in dosing frequency (see \n\nsection 5.1). If adequate response is achieved with an increased dosing frequency, the dose may \n\nsubsequently be reduced to 40 mg every other week. \n\n \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa \n\n \n\nThe recommended SOLYMBIC dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is \n\n160 mg initially at day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day \n\nfor two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at day 15 (given as two 40 mg \n\ninjections in one day). Two weeks later (day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week. \n\nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with SOLYMBIC if necessary. It is recommended that \n\nthe patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment \n\nwith SOLYMBIC. \n\n \n\nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no \n\nimprovement within this time period.  \n\n \n\nShould treatment be interrupted, SOLYMBIC 40 mg every week may be re-introduced (see \n\nsection 5.1).  \n\n \n\nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\nCrohn’s disease  \n\n \n\nThe recommended SOLYMBIC induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely \n\nactive Crohn’s disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. In case there is a need for a \n\nmore rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four \n\ninjections in one day or as two injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2, can be \n\nused with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction.  \n\n \n\nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \n\ninjection. Alternatively, if a patient has stopped SOLYMBIC and signs and symptoms of disease \n\nrecur, SOLYMBIC may be re-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after \n\nmore than 8 weeks since the previous dose. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \n\nguidelines.  \n\n \n\nSome patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dosing \n\nfrequency to 40 mg SOLYMBIC every week.  \n\n \n\nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \n\nthrough week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \n\nwithin this time period.  \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis  \n\n \n\nThe recommended SOLYMBIC induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe \n\nulcerative colitis is 160 mg at week 0 (dose can be administered as four injections in one day or as two \n\ninjections per day for two consecutive days) and 80 mg at week 2. After induction treatment, the \n\nrecommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \n\nguidelines.  \n\n \n\nSome patients who experience decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in dosing \n\nfrequency to 40 mg SOLYMBIC every week.  \n\n \n\nClinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. SOLYMBIC therapy should not \n\nbe continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. \n\n \n\nUveitis \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of SOLYMBIC for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, \n\nfollowed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited \n\nexperience in the initiation of treatment with adalimumab alone. Treatment with SOLYMBIC can be \n\ninitiated in combination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory \n\nagents. Concomitant corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two \n\nweeks after initiating treatment with SOLYMBIC. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \n\nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nElderly patients  \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is required.  \n\n \n\nImpaired renal and/or hepatic function  \n\n \n\nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \n\nmade. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is only available as 20 mg and 40 mg pre-filled syringe and 40 mg pre-filled pen. It is not \n\npossible to administer SOLYMBIC to paediatric patients that require less than a full 20 mg or 40 mg \n\ndose.

Impaired lung function \n\nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \n\ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with SOLYMBIC. Because the \n\nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \n\nthis period.  \n\n \n\nTreatment with SOLYMBIC should not be initiated in patients with active infections including \n\nchronic or localised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to \n\ntuberculosis and patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, \n\nsuch as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with \n\nSOLYMBIC should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections).  \n\n \n\nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with SOLYMBIC, should be \n\nmonitored closely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of SOLYMBIC \n\nshould be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate \n\nantimicrobial or antifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians \n\nshould exercise caution when considering the use of SOLYMBIC in patients with a history of \n\nrecurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, \n\nincluding the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nSerious infections \n\n \n\nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \n\nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \n\npatients receiving adalimumab.  \n\n \n\nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \n\nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n\n \n\nTuberculosis \n\n \n\nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \n\nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) \n\ntuberculosis. \n\n \n\nBefore initiation of therapy with SOLYMBIC, all patients must be evaluated for both active or \n\ninactive (“latent”) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment \n\nof patient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \n\nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \n\ntest and chest x-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \n\nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the patient alert card. \n\nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \n\nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised.  \n\n \n\nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, SOLYMBIC therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \n\nconsidered. \n\n \n\nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \n\nconsulted. \n\n \n\nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \n\nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of SOLYMBIC, and in accordance with local \n\nrecommendations. \n\n \n\nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of \n\nSOLYMBIC in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test \n\nfor tuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate \n\ncourse of treatment cannot be confirmed. \n\n \n\nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \n\npatients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \n\ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab.  \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \n\ninfection (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or \n\nafter therapy with SOLYMBIC.  \n\n \n\nOther opportunistic infections \n\n \n\nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \n\nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-\n\nantagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal \n\noutcomes.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \n\ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant \n\nshock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of SOLYMBIC should be \n\npromptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients \n\nshould be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive \n\nfungal infections.  \n\n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation  \n\n \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \n\nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal \n\noutcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with SOLYMBIC. \n\nFor patients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in \n\nthe treatment of hepatitis B is recommended.  \n\n \n\nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with SOLYMBIC should be closely monitored for signs and \n\nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \n\nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \n\nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \n\nwho develop HBV reactivation, SOLYMBIC should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \n\nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n\n \n\nNeurological events  \n\n \n\nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \n\nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \n\ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \n\ndisease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use \n\nof SOLYMBIC in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \n\ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of SOLYMBIC should be considered if any of these \n\ndisorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central \n\ndemyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious \n\nintermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of SOLYMBIC therapy and regularly during treatment to \n\nassess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions  \n\n \n\nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \n\nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of \n\nserious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab \n\nadministration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of \n\nSOLYMBIC should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n\n \n\nDry natural rubber \n\n \n\nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe or pen is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of \n\nlatex), which may cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nImmunosuppression  \n\n \n\nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \n\nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \n\nchange in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  \n\n \n\nIn the controlled portions of adalimumab clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of \n\nmalignancies including lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist \n\ncompared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post-marketing setting, cases \n\nof leukaemia have been reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased \n\nbackground risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing \n\nhighly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current \n\nknowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in \n\npatients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded.  \n\n \n\nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n\n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \n\nadalimumab in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \n\ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \n\nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \n\ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n\n \n\nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \n\nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \n\nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in \n\nyoung adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for \n\ninflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or \n\n6-mercaptopurine and SOLYMBIC should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of \n\nhepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with SOLYMBIC cannot be excluded (see \n\nsection 4.8).  \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \n\ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional \n\ncaution should be exercised in considering SOLYMBIC treatment of these patients (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \n\nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\n\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with SOLYMBIC. Melanoma and Merkel cell \n\ncarcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab \n\n(see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \n\nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \n\nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \n\nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \n\nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \n\nheavy smoking.  \n\n \n\nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \n\nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \n\ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \n\ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \n\ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \n\nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations.  \n\n \n\nHaematologic reactions  \n\n \n\nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \n\nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \n\nthrombocytopenia, leucopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \n\nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on SOLYMBIC. Discontinuation of \n\nSOLYMBIC therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic \n\nabnormalities.  \n\n \n\nVaccinations  \n\n \n\nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \n\nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \n\nby live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab.  \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \n\nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating SOLYMBIC therapy.  \n\n \n\nPatients on SOLYMBIC may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. \n\nAdministration of live vaccines to infants exposed to SOLYMBIC in utero is not recommended for \n\n5 months following the mother’s last SOLYMBIC injection during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nCongestive heart failure  \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \n\nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \n\nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. SOLYMBIC should be used with \n\ncaution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). SOLYMBIC is contraindicated in \n\nmoderate to severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with SOLYMBIC must be discontinued \n\nin patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure.  \n\n \n\nAutoimmune processes  \n\n \n\nTreatment with SOLYMBIC may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of \n\nlong-term treatment with SOLYMBIC on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a \n\npatient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with SOLYMBIC \n\nand is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with SOLYMBIC \n\nshould not be given (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists  \n\n \n\nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-\n\nantagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \n\nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \n\ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \n\ncombination of SOLYMBIC and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of SOLYMBIC with other biologic DMARDS (e.g. anakinra and \n\nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \n\ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions (see section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\nSurgery  \n\n \n\nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \n\nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \n\npatient who requires surgery while on SOLYMBIC should be closely monitored for infections, and \n\nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \n\narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nSmall bowel obstruction  \n\n \n\nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \n\nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \n\nstrictures. \n\n \n\nElderly patients  \n\n \n\nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab-treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) \n\nwas higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular \n\nattention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nSee Vaccinations above. \n\n \n\n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\n \n\nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \n\npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \n\nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate \n\nin comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted \n\nin increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see \n\nsection 5.1).  \n\n \n\nThe combination of SOLYMBIC and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \n\nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n\n \n\nThe combination of SOLYMBIC and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent \n\nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists”).  \n\n \n\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n\n \n\nWomen of child bearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential are strongly recommended to use adequate contraception to prevent \n\npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last SOLYMBIC treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\n \n\nFor adalimumab, limited clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.  \n\n \n\nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \n\nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n\n(see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \n\nimmune responses in the newborn. Administration of SOLYMBIC is not recommended during \n\npregnancy. \n\n \n\nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \n\nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \n\nof live vaccines to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months following \n\nthe mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether adalimumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after \n\ningestion.  \n\n \n\nHowever, because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at \n\nleast five months after the last SOLYMBIC treatment.  \n\n \n\nFertility  \n\n \n\nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available.  \n\n \n\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \n\nimpairment may occur following administration of SOLYMBIC (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.8  Undesirable effects  \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\n \n\nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open-label trials for up to \n\n60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long-\n\nstanding disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-\n\nrelated arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis \n\nwithout radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, \n\nhidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients \n\nreceiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled \n\nperiod.  \n\n \n\nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \n\ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control \n\ntreated patients.  \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \n\nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab.

Injection site reactions generally did not \n\nnecessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product. \n\n \n\nInfections  \n\n \n\nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \n\nthe adalimumab-treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \n\npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \n\nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved.  \n\n \n\nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab-treated patients and 0.03 \n\nper patient year in placebo and active control-treated patients.  \n\n \n\nIn controlled and open-label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n\n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \n\ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n\n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \n\npneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \n\nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease.  \n\n \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  \n\n \n\nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient-years \n\nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric \n\npatients with an exposure of 498.1 patient-years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with \n\nCrohn’s disease.

The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-\n\nmelanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients \n\nand 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell \n\ncarcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among \n\nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients.

The observed rate of non-\n\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient-years, and the observed rate of \n\nlymphomas is approximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient-years.  \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \n\nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \n\nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n\n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nAutoantibodies  \n\n \n\nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \n\nstudies I−V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and active \n\ncontrol-treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at \n\nweek 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic \n\narthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new onset lupus-like syndrome.

Detailed information is available on the website of the \n\nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action  \n\n \n\nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \n\ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \n\nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leucocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \n\nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n\n \n\nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n\n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \n\nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \n\nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \n\ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \n\nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.  \n\n \n\nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with \n\nadalimumab. In patients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing \n\ninflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. \n\nEndoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab-\n\ntreated patients.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis  \n\n \n\nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The \n\nefficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled \n\nstudies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration.  \n\n \n\nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\n≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had \n\ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \n\nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n\n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. \n\n \n\nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\n≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses \n\nof 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo \n\non alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same \n\nduration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed.  \n\n \n\nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\n≥ 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \n\nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \n\nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab \n\nevery week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with \n\nplacebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in \n\nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other \n\nweek up to 10 years. \n\n \n\nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \n\narthritis who were ≥ 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-\n\nrheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy \n\nwas stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \n\nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \n\nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \n\nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \n\nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \n\nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \n\nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 \n\nweeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was \n\nadministered every other week up to 10 years. \n\n \n\nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \n\npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26.

Patients were \n\nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n\n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-\n\nlabel (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n\n40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was \n\nthe percent change from baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not \n\ndue to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with \n\nmean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the adalimumab \n\ngroup compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. \n\nImprovement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through \n\nweek 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. \n\nAlthough not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in \n\nsecondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count \n\n(SJC), paediatric ACR 50 response, and paediatric ACR 70 response. \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n\n \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline \n\nscore of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in \n\nall groups) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1%) \n\npatients were treated concomitantly with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4%) \n\npatients with glucocorticoids. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which \n\npatients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 \n\nweeks. Subjects (n = 215, 54.7%) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at weeks 12, or 16 or 20 received \n\nearly escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were subsequently \n\ntreated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. \n\n \n\nIn the larger AS study I with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the \n\nsigns and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with adalimumab compared to \n\nplacebo.

Patients received placebo or \n\nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \n\nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. \n\n \n\nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \n\nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2 week standardised dose of \n\nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \n\ncorticosteroid discontinuation by week 15. \n\n \n\nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n\n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent \n\na mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ‘time to treatment failure’. Treatment failure was \n\ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \n\nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \n\nvisual acuity (BCVA). \n\n \n\nClinical response \n\n \n\nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \n\nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (See table 23). Both \n\nstudies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus \n\nplacebo (see figure 1). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nTable 23 Time to treatment failure in studies UV I and UV II \n\n \n\nAnalysis \n\n          Treatment \n\n \n\nN Failure \n\nN (%) \n\n \n\nMedian \n\ntime to \n\nfailure \n\n(months) \n\n \n\nHRa CI 95% \n\nfor HRa \n\n \n\nP Value \nb\n\n \n\n \n\nTime to treatment failure at or after week 6 in study UV I \n\nPrimary analysis (ITT) \n\n \n\n          Placebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 -- -- -- \n\n          Adalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36, \n\n0.70 \n\n< 0.001 \n\nTime to treatment failure at or after week 2 in study UV II \n\nPrimary analysis (ITT) \n\n \n\n          Placebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 -- -- -- \n\n          Adalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39, \n\n0.84 \n\n0.004 \n\n \nNote: Treatment failure at or after week 6 (study UV I), or at or after week 2 (study UV II), was counted as \n\nevent.

Formation of anti-\n\nadalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab. \n\nThere is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the \n\noccurrence of adverse events.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \n\nadalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in ulcerative colitis and non-infectious \n\nuveitis, see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  \n\n \n\nAbsorption and distribution  \n\n \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \n\nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \n\naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \n\nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \n\nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from \n\n11 to 15 mL/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \n\nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \n\nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum.  \n\n \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \n\narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 μg/mL \n\n(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 μg/mL (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. \n\nThe serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose \n\nfollowing 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week.  \n\n \n\nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \n\nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n\n(values measured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 µg/mL for \n\nadalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 µg/mL with concomitant methotrexate. \n\n \n\nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 μg/mL during \n\nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment.  \n\n \n\nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \n\nweek to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab \n\ntrough concentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 μg/mL (79% CV). \n\n \n\nIn patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \n\non week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 μg/mL at week \n\n2 and week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were \n\napproximately 8 to 10 μg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nIn patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \n\nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n\n5.5 μg/mL during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n\n80 mg adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n\n12 μg/mL during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 μg/mL \n\nwere observed in Crohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab \n\nevery other week. \n\n \n\nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n\n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. \n\nAt week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n\n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (±SD) serum \n\nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7 ± 6.6 μg/mL for patients ≥ 40 kg \n\n(160/80 mg) and 10.6 ± 6.1 μg/mL for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg).  \n\n \n\nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough \n\nconcentrations at week 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 μg/mL for the standard dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 μg/mL for \n\nthe low dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to \n\nreceive adalimumab treatment every other week for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from \n\nevery other week to weekly regimen, the mean (±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at week 52 \n\nwere 15.3 ± 11.4 μg/mL (40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7 ± 3.5 μg/mL (20/10 mg, weekly).  \n\n \n\nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \n\nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 μg/mL \n\nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 μg/mL were observed \n\nin ulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n\n \n\nIn patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \n\nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \n\napproximately 8 to 10 μg/mL. \n\n \n\nElimination  \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \n\nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \n\ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \n\nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be \n\nlower in patients with measurable AAA.  \n\n \n\nHepatic or renal impairment  \n\n \n\nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  \n\n \n\n5.3  Preclinical safety data  \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \n\nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.  \n\n \n\nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \n\nCynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of \n\nharm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of \n\nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models \n\nfor an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising \n\nantibodies in rodents.  \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What SOLYMBIC is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC contains the active substance adalimumab, a selective immuno suppressive agent.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is intended for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis in children 6 \n\nto 17 years, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of \n\nankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, paediatric psoriasis \n\n(patients weighing either 23 to 28 kg or 47 kg and greater), Crohn’s disease in adults and children, \n\nulcerative colitis and non-infectious uveitis affecting the back of the eye. It is a medicine that \n\ndecreases the inflammation process of these diseases. The active ingredient, adalimumab, is a human \n\nmonoclonal antibody produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise \n\nand bind to other unique proteins.  \n\n \n\nAdalimumab binds to a specific protein (tumour necrosis factor or TNFα), which is present at \n\nincreased levels in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, \n\nankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis \n\nand non-infectious uveitis affecting the back of the eye.  \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis  \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \n\nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given SOLYMBIC to treat your \n\nrheumatoid arthritis.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without \n\nprevious methotrexate treatment. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC slows down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \n\nto improve physical function.  \n\n \n\nUsually, SOLYMBIC is used with methotrexate. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \n\ninappropriate, SOLYMBIC can be given alone. \n\n \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis  \n\n \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. \n\nYou may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not \n\nrespond well enough to these medicines, you will be given SOLYMBIC to treat your enthesitis-related \n\narthritis.  \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis  \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \n\nevidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \n\nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \n\nmedicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given SOLYMBIC to \n\nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.  \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis  \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. SOLYMBIC slows down the damage to the \n\ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function.  \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \n\nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift \n\naway from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the \n\nbody’s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. SOLYMBIC is also used to \n\ntreat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents weighing either 23 to 28 kg or 47 kg or \n\ngreater for whom topical therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not \n\nsuitable. \n\n \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa \n\n \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory \n\nskin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\nIt most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner \n\nthighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults. SOLYMBIC can reduce the number of \n\nnodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with the disease. \n\n \n\nCrohn’s disease in adults and children  \n\n \n\nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n\n \nSOLYMBIC is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have \n\nCrohn’s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \n\nmedicines, you will be given SOLYMBIC to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s disease.  \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis  \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \n\ngiven other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \n\nSOLYMBIC to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n\n \n\nNon-infectious uveitis affecting the back of the eye \n\n \n\nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. SOLYMBIC is \n\nused to treat adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye. This \n\ninflammation leads to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \n\nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). SOLYMBIC works by reducing this inflammation. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use SOLYMBIC \n\n \n\nDo not use SOLYMBIC: \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n\nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \n\nfeeling tired, dental problems.  \n\n- if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using SOLYMBIC: \n\n \n\n- If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash do not inject more SOLYMBIC and contact your doctor immediately  since, in \n\nrare cases, these reactions can be life threatening.  \n \n\n- If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting SOLYMBIC. If you are unsure, please contact your doctor.  \n\n \n\n- You might get infections more easily while you are receiving SOLYMBIC treatment. This risk \n\nmay increase if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \n\ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic \n\ninfections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\ndoctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor \n\nmay recommend temporary discontinuation of SOLYMBIC.  \n\n \n\n- As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting SOLYMBIC. This will \n\ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening \n\ntests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests \n\nshould be recorded on your Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if \n\nyou have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \n\ntuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative \n\ntreatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, \n\nlistlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor \n\nimmediately.  \n\n \n\n- Advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic.  \n\n \n\n- Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections.  \n\n \n\n- Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. \n\nSOLYMBIC can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, \n\nespecially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of \n\nHBV can be life-threatening.  \n\n \n- If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking SOLYMBIC. \n\nYou and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being \n\ntreated with SOLYMBIC. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, \n\nsuch as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n\n- If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are \n\ntaking SOLYMBIC. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of SOLYMBIC. \n\n \n\n- If you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide \n\nif you should receive or continue to receive SOLYMBIC. Tell your doctor immediately if you \n\nexperience symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness \n\nor tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \n\n- Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving SOLYMBIC. \n\nPlease check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, \n\nif possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current \n\nimmunisation guidelines prior to initiating SOLYMBIC therapy. If you received SOLYMBIC \n\nwhile you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to \n\napproximately five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that \n\nyou tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your SOLYMBIC use \n\nduring your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \n\n- If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with SOLYMBIC, your heart failure \n\nstatus must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have \n\nhad or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart \n\nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor \n\nimmediately.  \n\n \n\n- In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \n\nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may \n\ndecide to stop treatment. \n\n \n\n- There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had \n\nthe disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a type of \n\ncancer that affects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a type of cancer that affects the blood and \n\nbone marrow). If you take SOLYMBIC the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other \n\ncancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been \n\nobserved in some patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with \n\nazathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or \n\n6-mercaptopurine with SOLYMBIC. In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been \n\nobserved in patients taking adalimumab. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if \n\nexisting lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n \n\n- There have been cases of cancers other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF \n\nblocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \n\nwhether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.  \n\n \n\nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), \n\nwhich may cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the \n\ntradename and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also \n\nwish to make a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n- Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \n\nSOLYMBIC. \n\n- Do not use the 20 mg or 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 20 mg or 40 mg are \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and SOLYMBIC  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \n\nagents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or \n\npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n\n \n\nYou should not take SOLYMBIC with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra or \n\nabatacept. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nThe effects of SOLYMBIC in pregnant women are not known and so the use of SOLYMBIC in \n\npregnant women is not recommended. You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use \n\nadequate contraception while using SOLYMBIC and for at least 5 months after the last SOLYMBIC \n\ntreatment. If you become pregnant, you should consult your doctor.  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether SOLYMBIC passes into breast milk.  \n\n \n\nIf you are a breast-feeding mother, you should stop breast-feeding during SOLYMBIC treatment and \n\nfor at least 5 months after the last SOLYMBIC treatment. If you received SOLYMBIC during your \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\npregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. It is important that you tell your \n\nbaby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your SOLYMBIC use during your pregnancy \n\nbefore the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section on vaccination). \n\n \n\nIf you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for \n\nadvice before taking this medicine.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room \n\nspinning sensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking SOLYMBIC. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC contains sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 mL dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\n\nfree’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use SOLYMBIC \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \n\nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). The usual dose for adults with rheumatoid \n\narthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg given every other week as a single dose.  \n\n \n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using SOLYMBIC. If your doctor determines \n\nthat methotrexate is inappropriate, SOLYMBIC can be given alone.  \n\n \n\nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your SOLYMBIC therapy, \n\nyour doctor may decide to give 40 mg every week. \n\n \n\nChildren with enthesitis-related arthritis \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of SOLYMBIC for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis, aged 6 to 17 years \n\ndepends on the height and weight of the child. Your child’s doctor will tell you the correct dose to use. \n\n \n\nAdults with psoriasis  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose for adults with psoriasis is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose. You should continue to inject SOLYMBIC for as \n\nlong as your doctor has told you. Depending on your response, your doctor may increase the dose \n\nfrequency to 40 mg every week. \n\n \n\nChildren or adolescents with plaque psoriasis  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of SOLYMBIC for patients aged 4 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis depends \n\non the weight of your child. SOLYMBIC should only be used in patients weighing either 23 to 28 kg \n\nor 47 kg and greater. Your child’s doctor will tell you the correct dose to use. \n\n \n\nAdults with hidradenitis suppurativa \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\nThe usual dose regimen for hidradenitis suppurativa is an initial dose of 160 mg (as four 40 mg \n\ninjections in one day or two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by an 80 mg \n\ndose (as two 40 mg injections on the same day) two weeks later. After two further weeks, continue \n\nwith a dose of 40 mg every week. It is recommended that you use an antiseptic wash daily on the \n\naffected areas. \n\n \n\nAdults with Crohn’s disease  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose regimen for Crohn’s disease is 80 mg initially followed by 40 mg every other week \n\ntwo weeks later. If a faster response is required, your doctor may prescribe an initial dose of 160 mg \n\n(as four 40 mg injections in one day or two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), \n\nfollowed by 80 mg two weeks later, and thereafter as 40 mg every other week. Depending on your \n\nresponse, your doctor may increase the dose frequency to 40 mg every week.  \n\n \n\nChildren or adolescents with Crohn's disease  \n\n \n\nChildren or adolescents weighing less than 40 kg:  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose regimen is 40 mg initially followed by 20 mg two weeks later.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What SOLYMBIC is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC contains the active substance adalimumab, a selective immuno suppressive agent.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is intended for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis in children 6 \n\nto 17 years, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of \n\nankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, paediatric psoriasis \n\n(patients weighing either 23 to 28 kg or 47 kg and greater), Crohn’s disease in adults and children, \n\nulcerative colitis and non-infectious uveitis affecting the back of the eye. It is a medicine that \n\ndecreases the inflammation process of these diseases. The active ingredient, adalimumab, is a human \n\nmonoclonal antibody produced by cultured cells. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise \n\nand bind to other unique proteins.  \n\n \n\nAdalimumab binds to a specific protein (tumour necrosis factor or TNFα), which is present at \n\nincreased levels in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, \n\nankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis \n\nand non-infectious uveitis affecting the back of the eye.  \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis  \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \n\nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n\nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given SOLYMBIC to treat your \n\nrheumatoid arthritis.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without \n\nprevious methotrexate treatment. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC slows down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \n\nto improve physical function.  \n\n \n\nUsually, SOLYMBIC is used with methotrexate. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \n\ninappropriate, SOLYMBIC can be given alone. \n\n \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis  \n\n \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. \n\nYou may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not \n\nrespond well enough to these medicines, you will be given SOLYMBIC to treat your enthesitis-related \n\narthritis.  \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis  \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \n\nevidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \n\nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \n\nmedicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given SOLYMBIC to \n\nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.  \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis  \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. SOLYMBIC slows down the damage to the \n\ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function.  \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \n\nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift \n\naway from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the \n\nbody’s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. SOLYMBIC is also used to \n\ntreat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents weighing either 23 to 28 kg or 47 kg or \n\ngreater for whom topical therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not \n\nsuitable. \n\n \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa \n\n \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory \n\nskin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n\nIt most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner \n\nthighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults. SOLYMBIC can reduce the number of \n\nnodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with the disease. \n\n \n\nCrohn’s disease in adults and children  \n\n \n\nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n\n \nSOLYMBIC is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have \n\nCrohn’s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \n\nmedicines, you will be given SOLYMBIC to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s disease.  \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis  \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \n\ngiven other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \n\nSOLYMBIC to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n\n \n\nNon-infectious uveitis affecting the back of the eye \n\n \n\nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. SOLYMBIC is \n\nused to treat adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye. This \n\ninflammation leads to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or \n\nwispy lines that move across the field of vision). SOLYMBIC works by reducing this inflammation. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use SOLYMBIC \n\n \n\nDo not use SOLYMBIC: \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see “Warnings and precautions”). \n\nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \n\nfeeling tired, dental problems.  \n\n- if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using SOLYMBIC: \n\n \n\n- If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash do not inject more SOLYMBIC and contact your doctor immediately since, in \n\nrare cases, these reactions can be life threatening.  \n \n\n- If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting SOLYMBIC. If you are unsure, please contact your doctor.  \n\n \n\n- You might get infections more easily while you are receiving SOLYMBIC treatment. This risk \n\nmay increase if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \n\ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic \n\ninfections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n\ndoctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor \n\nmay recommend temporary discontinuation of SOLYMBIC.  \n\n \n\n- As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting SOLYMBIC. This will \n\ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening \n\ntests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests \n\nshould be recorded on your Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if \n\nyou have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \n\ntuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative \n\ntreatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, \n\nlistlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor \n\nimmediately.  \n\n \n\n- Advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic.  \n\n \n\n- Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections.  \n\n \n\n- Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. \n\nSOLYMBIC can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, \n\nespecially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of \n\nHBV can be life-threatening.  \n\n \n- If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking SOLYMBIC. \n\nYou and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being \n\ntreated with SOLYMBIC. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, \n\nsuch as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n\n- If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are \n\ntaking SOLYMBIC. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of SOLYMBIC. \n\n \n\n- If you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide \n\nif you should receive or continue to receive SOLYMBIC. Tell your doctor immediately if you \n\nexperience symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness \n\nor tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \n\n- Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving SOLYMBIC. \n\nPlease check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, \n\nif possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current \n\nimmunisation guidelines prior to initiating SOLYMBIC therapy. If you received SOLYMBIC \n\nwhile you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to \n\napproximately five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that \n\nyou tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your SOLYMBIC use \n\nduring your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \n\n- If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with SOLYMBIC, your heart failure \n\nstatus must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have \n\nhad or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart \n\nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\n- In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \n\nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may \n\ndecide to stop treatment. \n\n \n\n- There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had \n\nthe disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a type of \n\ncancer that affects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a type of cancer that affects the blood and \n\nbone marrow). If you take SOLYMBIC the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other \n\ncancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been \n\nobserved in some patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with \n\nazathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-\n\nmercaptopurine with SOLYMBIC. In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been \n\nobserved in patients taking adalimumab. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if \n\nexisting lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n \n\n- There have been cases of cancers other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF \n\nblocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \n\nwhether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.  \n\n \n\nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \n\nmay cause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the \n\ntradename and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also \n\nwish to make a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n- Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \n\nSOLYMBIC. \n\n \n\n- Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled pen if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and SOLYMBIC  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \n\nagents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or \n\npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n\n \n\nYou should not take SOLYMBIC with medicines containing the active substance, anakinra or \n\nabatacept. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nThe effects of SOLYMBIC in pregnant women are not known and so the use of SOLYMBIC in \n\npregnant women is not recommended. You are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use \n\nadequate contraception while using SOLYMBIC and for at least 5 months after the last SOLYMBIC \n\ntreatment. If you become pregnant, you should consult your doctor.  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether SOLYMBIC passes into breast milk.  \n\n \n\nIf you are a breast-feeding mother, you should stop breast-feeding during SOLYMBIC treatment and \n\nfor at least 5 months after the last SOLYMBIC treatment. If you received SOLYMBIC during your \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n\npregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. It is important that you tell your \n\nbaby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your SOLYMBIC use during your pregnancy \n\nbefore the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section on vaccination). \n\n \n\nIf you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for \n\nadvice before taking this medicine.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room \n\nspinning sensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking SOLYMBIC. \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC contains sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 mL dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\n\nfree’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use SOLYMBIC \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \n\nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis  \n\n \n\nSOLYMBIC is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). The usual dose for adults with rheumatoid \n\narthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg given every other week as a single dose.  \n\n \n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using SOLYMBIC. If your doctor determines \n\nthat methotrexate is inappropriate, SOLYMBIC can be given alone.  \n\n \n\nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your SOLYMBIC therapy, \n\nyour doctor may decide to give 40 mg every week. \n\n \n\nChildren with enthesitis-related arthritis \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of SOLYMBIC for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis, aged 6 to 17 years \n\ndepends on the height and weight of the child. Your child’s doctor will tell you the correct dose to use. \n\n \n\nAdults with psoriasis  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose for adults with psoriasis is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose. You should continue to inject SOLYMBIC for as \n\nlong as your doctor has told you. Depending on your response, your doctor may increase the dose \n\nfrequency to 40 mg every week.  \n\n \n\nChildren or adolescents with plaque psoriasis  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of SOLYMBIC for patients aged 4 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis depends \n\non the weight of your child. SOLYMBIC should only be used in patients weighing either 23 to 28 kg \n\nor 47 kg and greater. Your child’s doctor will tell you the correct dose to use. \n\n \n\nAdults with hidradenitis suppurativa \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n\nThe usual dose regimen for hidradenitis suppurativa is an initial dose of 160 mg (as four 40 mg \n\ninjections in one day or two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by an 80 mg \n\ndose (as two 40 mg injections on the same day) two weeks later. After two further weeks, continue \n\nwith a dose of 40 mg every week. It is recommended that you use an antiseptic wash daily on the \n\naffected areas. \n\n \n\nAdults with Crohn’s disease  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose regimen for Crohn’s disease is 80 mg initially followed by 40 mg every other week \n\ntwo weeks later. If a faster response is required, your doctor may prescribe an initial dose of 160 mg \n\n(as four 40 mg injections in one day or two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), \n\nfollowed by 80 mg two weeks later, and thereafter as 40 mg every other week. Depending on your \n\nresponse, your doctor may increase the dose frequency to 40 mg every week.  \n\n \n\nChildren or adolescents with Crohn's disease  \n\n \n\nChildren or adolescents weighing less than 40 kg:  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose regimen is 40 mg initially followed by 20 mg two weeks later. If a faster response is \n\nrequired, your doctor may prescribe an initial dose of 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in 1 day) \n\nfollowed by 40 mg two weeks later.  \n\n \n\nThereafter, the usual dose is 20 mg every other week. Depending on your response, your doctor may \n\nincrease the dose frequency to 20 mg every week. \n\n \n\nDo not use the 40 mg pre-filled pen for the 20 mg dose in children or adolescent weighing less than \n\n40 kg with Crohn’s disease. The 20 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe can be used for the \n\n20 mg dose. \n\n \n\nChildren or adolescents weighing 40 kg or more:  \n\n \n\nThe usual dose regimen is 80 mg initially followed by 40 mg two weeks later.
