This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSCENESSE 16 mg implant \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nThe implant contains 16 mg of afamelanotide. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nImplant. \nSolid white to off-white rod approximately 1.7 cm in length and 1.5 mm in diameter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSCENESSE is indicated for prevention of phototoxicity in adult patients with erythropoietic \nprotoporphyria (EPP). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nSCENESSE should only be prescribed by specialist physicians in recognised porphyria centres and \nadministration should be performed by a physician trained and accredited by the marketing \nauthorisation holder to administer the implant. \n \nPosology \n \nOne implant is administered every 2 months prior to expected and during increased sunlight exposure, \ne.g. from spring to early autumn. Three implants per year are recommended, depending on the length \nof protection required. The recommended maximum number of implants is four per year. The overall \nduration of treatment is at the specialist physician’s discretion (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nFor patients with renal or hepatic impairment see sections 4.3 and  5.2. \n \nElderly population \n \nDue to limited data in treatment of elderly patients, the use of afamelanotide is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of afamelanotide in children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years have not yet \nbeen established. \nNo data are available. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nFor subcutaneous use. \n\n \nInstruction for use \n \n- Take the packed implant out of the refrigerator and allow the medicinal product to warm up to \n\nambient temperature. \n- Have the patient sit in a comfortable position or lie on his/her back with the upper part of the \n\nbody slightly raised. \n- Disinfect the skin above the supra-iliac crest. \n- Anaesthetise the insertion area if deemed necessary and in consultation with the patient. \n- Select a 14 gauge (1.6 mm inner diameter) catheter with needle. \n- Mark 1.5 to 2 cm on the catheter shaft using surgical ink. \n- Hold the catheter at its base using a sterile technique, pinch and hold the skinfold cranial to, or \n\noverlying the patient’s supra-iliac crest with two fingers. \n- With the bevel of the needle facing upwards, insert the catheter laterally 1.5 to 2 cm into the \n\nsubcutaneous layer at a 30 to 45 degree angle to the skin surface in one continuous flowing \nmovement. \n\n- With the catheter in place, aseptically remove the implant from the vial. \n- Remove the needle from within the catheter using a sterile technique. \n- Transfer the implant to the outlet of the catheter. \n- Using a suitable device (such as a stylet) gently push the implant down the full length of the \n\ncatheter lumen. \n- Apply some pressure to the insertion area with your finger while removing the stylet and the \n\ncatheter. \n- Confirm insertion of the implant by palpating the skin with subcutis cranial to/overlying the \n\nsuprailiac crest until the implant is located. Always verify the presence of the implant, if in \ndoubt of its presence, check whether the implant has remained in the catheter. If the implant has \nnot been administered during the procedural steps described above, discard the implant and \nadminister a new implant. Do not administer a new implant unless it has been unequivocally \nconfirmed that the first one had not been inserted. \n\n- Apply a small pressure dressing to the injection site. \n- Observe the patient for 30 minutes to ensure that you will notice if the patient develops an \n\nallergic or hypersensitivity reaction (immediate type). \n \nThe implant can be surgically removed if needed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n- Presence of severe hepatic disease \n- Hepatic impairment (see section 5.2) \n- Renal impairment (see section 5.2) \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nConcomitant disorders not studied \n \nClinically significant disorders of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine (including \ndiabetes, Cushing’s disease, Addison’s disease, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), neurological (including \nseizures) and haematological (especially anaemia) systems have not been evaluated. \nA careful decision must be made whether to treat patients with any of these conditions with this \nmedicinal product. If such patients are treated they must be monitored after each implant \nadministration, including vital signs, routine haematology, and biochemistry. \n \nSun protection \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nIt is recommended that sun protection measures routinely adopted by each patient to manage their \nphotosensitivity related to EPP and in accordance with their skin type (Fitzpatrick scale) are \nmaintained during treatment with this medicinal product. \n \nSkin monitoring \n \nAfamelanotide may induce darkening of pre-existing pigmentary lesions due to its pharmacological \neffect. A regular full body skin examination (every 6 months) is recommended to monitor all \npigmentary lesions and other skin abnormalities. \nIf the skin changes noted are consistent with skin cancer or its precursors, or are ambiguous to the \nporphyria specialist, dermatology specialist consultation should be sought. \nThe two total full body skin examinations per year are intended to: \n- detect early any skin cancers and their precursors induced by UV-exposure, as EPP patients can \n\nbe expected to significantly increase their exposure to sunlight and UV light while on treatment \nwith afamelanotide. EPP patients with fair skin may be more likely to request treatment and are \nmore prone to developing UV light-associated skin changes, including cancer; \n\n- detect and monitor changes in pigmentary lesions, thus allowing early detection of melanoma. \nSpecial caution is warranted in patients with an \n- individual or family history of melanoma (inclusive of in-situ melanoma, e.g. lentigo maligna) \n\nor suspected or confirmed susceptibility to cutaneous melanoma (CMM1, MIM #155600, \nsynonyms: familial atypical mole-malignant melanoma syndrome, FAMMM; dysplastic naevus \nsyndrome, DNS; B-K mole syndrome; CMM2 MIM #155601) \n\nand/or an \n- individual history of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (inclusive of carcinoma in \n\nsitu, e.g. Bowen’s disease), Merkel cell carcinoma, or other malignant or premalignant skin \nlesions. \n\n \nLong-term use \n \nLong-term safety data for afamelanotide are limited. \nThe safety of this medicinal product has not been evaluated in clinical trials of duration longer \nthan 2 years (see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \n \nSince available data in treatment of the elderly are limited, afamelanotide should not be used in \npatients over 70 years of age. If such patients are treated they must be monitored after administration \nof every implant, including vital signs, routine haematology and biochemistry. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with this medicinal product. \nPharmacokinetic data for afamelanotide or any of its metabolites are very limited. As an oligopeptide \nwith a short half-life, afamelanotide is expected to be rapidly hydrolysed into shorter peptide \nfragments and into its individual amino acids. However, due to the lack of data caution is warranted. \nPatients taking substances which reduce coagulation, such as vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin), \nacetylsalicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) may experience increased \nbruising or bleeding at the site of implantation. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment with \nSCENESSE and for a period of three months thereafter. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amounts of data from the use of afamelanotide in pregnant women. \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). A risk to \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nSCENESSE should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \neffective contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether afamelanotide or any of its metabolites are excreted in breast milk. \nNo clinical data are available on the use of afamelanotide in breastfeeding women. \n \nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. SCENESSE should not be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on the effects of afamelanotide on fertility. Animal studies have not shown \nany harmful effect on fertility and reproduction. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAfamelanotide has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines, especially \nwithin 72 hours of administration. Following administration of this medicinal product, somnolence, \nfatigue, dizziness, and nausea have been reported. Patients should not drive or use machines in case \nthey are affected by these symptoms. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile is based on pooled data from clinical studies in 425 patients. \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are nausea, experienced by approximately 19% of \nsubjects who received treatment with this medicinal product, headache (20%), and implant site \nreactions (21%; mainly discolouration, pain, haematoma, erythema). In most cases these adverse \nreactions are reported to be mild in severity. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions reported during clinical trials conducted with afamelanotide are listed in the \ntable below by MedDRA system organ class and frequency convention. \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data) \n \nSystem Organ Class  Very common Common  Uncommon  \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n  \nUpper respiratory tract \ninfection \n \n\nInfluenza \nGastrointestinal infection \nGastroenteritis \nFolliculitis \nCandidiasis \nNasopharyngitis \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and \n\n  Haemangioma \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSystem Organ Class  Very common Common  Uncommon  \nunspecified (incl cysts \nand polyps) \nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders  \n\n  Leukopenia \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders  \n\n Decreased appetite  Hypercholesterolaemia \nIncreased appetite  \n\nPsychiatric disorders   Depression \nDepressed mood \nInsomnia \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache \n \n\nMigraine \nDizziness \nLethargy \nSomnolence \n \n\nSyncope \nRestless leg syndrome \nHyperaesthesia \nPresyncope \nPost-traumatic headache \nBurning sensation \nPoor quality sleep \nDysgeusia \n\nEye disorders   Eyelid oedema \nOcular hyperaemia \nDry eye \nPresbyopia \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n  Tinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders   Palpitations \nTachycardia \n\nVascular disorders  Flushing \nHot flush \n\nHaematoma \nDiastolic hypertension \nHypertension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Dysphonia \nSinus congestion \nRhinitis \nNasal congestion  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea Abdominal pain \nAbdominal pain upper \nDiarrhoea \nVomiting \n\nLip oedema \nLip swelling \nGastroesophageal reflux \ndisease \nGastritis \nDyspepsia \nCheilitis \nAbdominal distension \nGingival pain \nAbdominal discomfort \nToothache \nAbdominal symptom \nBowel movement irregularity \nFlatulence \nGingival discolouration \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSystem Organ Class  Very common Common  Uncommon  \nHypoaesthesia oral \nLip discolouration \nTongue discoloration \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Erythema \nMelanocytic naevus \nPigmentation disorder \nSkin discolouration \nSkin \nhyperpigmentation \nEphelides \nPruritus \n \n\nLichen planus \nRash vesicular \nPruritus generalised \nRash \nRash erythematous \nRash papular \nRash pruritic \nSkin irritation \nVitiligo \nAcne \nEczema \nPigmentation lip \nPost inflammatory \npigmentation change \nSeborrhoea \nSkin exfoliation \nSkin hypopigmentation \nHair colour changes \nHyperhidrosis \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n Back pain \n \n\nArthralgia \nMyalgia \nPain in extremity \nMuscle spasm \nMusculoskeletal pain \nMusculoskeletal stiffness \nJoint stiffness \nGroin pain \nSensation of heaviness \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders  \n\n  Cystitis  \n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders \n\n  Menorrhagia \nDysmenorrhoea \nBreast tenderness \nMenstruation irregular \nVaginal discharge \nLibido decreased \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Implant site \nhypersensitivity \nImplant site reaction \nImplant site pain \nImplant site \nhaematoma \nImplant site erythema \nImplant site irritation \nAsthenia \n\nOedema peripheral \nOedema mucosal \nPain \nImplant site oedema \nPyrexia \nChills \nInjection site haematoma \nInjection site irritation \n\n\n\n8 \n\nSystem Organ Class  Very common Common  Uncommon  \nFatigue \nImplant site \ndiscolouration \nFeeling hot \n \n\nImplant site hypertrophy \nImplant site pruritus \nDevice expulsion \nApplication site \ndiscolouration \nHangover \nInfluenza like illness \n\nInvestigations  Blood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased \n \n\nAlanine aminotransferase \nincreased \nAspartate aminotransferase \nincreased \nLiver function test abnormal \nTransaminases increased \nTransferrin saturation \ndecreased \nBlood cholesterol increased \nBlood glucose increased \nBlood iron decreased \nBlood pressure diastolic \nincreased \nBlood urine present \nBiopsy skin \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\n  Wound complication \nOpen wound \nFall \nProcedural nausea \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are no data available on symptoms or treatment of overdose with afamelanotide. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Emollients and protectives, protectives against UV-radiation for systemic \nuse, ATC code: D02BB02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAfamelanotide is a synthetic tridecapeptide and a structural analogue of α-melanocyte stimulating \nhormone (α-MSH). Afamelanotide is a melanocortin receptor agonist and binds predominantly to the \nmelanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R). Its binding lasts longer than that of α-MSH. This results in part from \nafamelanotide’s resistance to immediate degradation by serum or proteolytic enzymes (see section \n\n\n\n9 \n\n5.2). It presumably undergoes hydrolysis within a short time; its metabolites’ pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics are not understood yet. \nAfamelanotide is thought to mimic the endogenous compound’s pharmacological activity by \nactivating the synthesis of eumelanin mediated by the MC1R receptor. \nEumelanin contributes to photoprotection through different mechanisms including: \n- strong broadband absorption of UV and visible light, where eumelanin acts as a filter \n- antioxidant activity through scavenging of free radicals; and \n- inactivation of the superoxide anion and increased availability of superoxide dismutase to \n\nreduce oxidative stress. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAdministration of afamelanotide may, therefore, result in increased production of eumelanin in the \nskin of the EPP patient independently of exposure to sunlight or artificial UV light. This can be \naccompanied by a darkening of the skin pigmentation in areas with melanocytes which gradually fades \nunless a further implant is administered. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIt has been demonstrated that EPP patients receiving afamelanotide had more exposure to direct \nsunlight (10:00 to 18:00 hours) during a 180 day trial period compared to placebo recipients (p=0.044; \nafamelanotide arithmetic mean: 115.6 h, median 69.4h; placebo mean 60.6h, median 40.8h). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSCENESSE in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in erythropoietic protoporphyria (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDose-finding studies have not been conducted. \nThe pharmacokinetics of afamelanotide have not been fully characterised yet, i.e. distribution, \nmetabolism or excretion are not clear. No pharmacokinetic information is available on any of its \nmetabolites (active or inactive). \nHalf-life is approximately 30 minutes. \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of the implant, most of the active substance is released within \nthe first 48 hours with over 90% released by day 5. Plasma levels of afamelanotide are maintained \nover a number of days. In most clinical studies afamelanotide plasma levels were below the limit of \nquantitation by day 10. The implant is absorbed by the body within 50 to 60 days after administration. \n \nData on possible interactions or effects in special populations, e.g. in patients with hepatic or renal \nimpairment are not available. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo data are available. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nIn repeated dose toxicity studies, the only finding of relevance was an increase in melanin \npigmentation in the dog, which is consistent with the active substance’s pharmacological activity. This \neffect was observed only at exposure levels approximately 8 times higher than human exposure. \nInflammation was observed in the Harderian gland in the rat. This finding is not considered relevant to \nhuman safety since the Harderian gland is not present in man. \n \nIn a fertility study no effects on the reproductive function of male or female Sprague-Dawley rats were \nobserved after subcutaneous application of afamelanotide. A study in Sprague-Dawley rats showed no \nadverse effects on embryo-fetal development at exposures approximately 135-fold the human \nexposure (based on Cmax). A second study on embryo-fetal development in Lister-Hooded rats did not \nachieve sufficient exposure. Pre- and post-natal development of Sprague-Dawley rats was not affected \nat exposures of about 135-times the human exposure (based on Cmax). \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of \nsection 4 for how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What SCENESSE is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive SCENESSE \n3. How SCENESSE is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How SCENESSE is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What SCENESSE is and what it is used for \n \nSCENESSE contains the active substance afamelanotide. Afamelanotide is a synthetic form of a body \nhormone called alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Afamelanotide works in a way \nsimilar to the natural hormone, by making skin cells produce eumelanin which is a brown-black type \nof melanin pigment in the body. \n \nAfamelanotide is used to increase the tolerance to sunlight in adults with a confirmed diagnosis of \nerythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). EPP is a condition in which patients have an increased sensitivity \nto sunlight, which can cause toxic effects such as pain and burning. By increasing the amount of \neumelanin, SCENESSE can help to delay the onset of pain due to skin photosensitivity (sensitive to \nsunlight). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive SCENESSE \n \nDo not use SCENESSE \n \n- if you are allergic to afamelanotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have any severe condition of the liver. \n- if you have liver problems. \n- if you have kidney problems. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before receiving SCENESSE if you have or have ever had: \n- heart problems or severe breathing problems; \n- gastrointestinal problems; \n- diabetes; \n\n\n\n22 \n\n- Cushing’s disease (a hormone disorder where the body produces too much of the hormone \ncortisol); \n\n- Addison’s disease (a disorder of the adrenal glands causing a lack of some hormones); \n- Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (a disorder that causes blockage of the bowel and where your hands, \n\nsoles of your feet and surface of your lips may have brown freckles); \n- epilepsy (or have been told that you are at risk of having fits); \n- anaemia (low counts of red blood cells in your blood); \n- melanoma (an aggressive type of skin cancer), including in-situ melanoma, e.g. lentigo maligna; \n\nor if you have certain inherited conditions that increase the risk of developing a melanoma; \n- skin cancer of the types, basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (inclusive of \n\ncarcinoma in situ, e.g. Bowen’s disease), Merkel cell carcinoma or other malignant or \npremalignant skin problems. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor before receiving SCENESSE if you are over 70 years of age. \n \nIf you have ever had any of these conditions your doctor may have to monitor you more closely during \nyour treatment. \n \nSun protection \n \nDo not change the sun protection measures you normally follow to manage your EPP and according to \nyour skin phototype (UV sensitivity). Keep in mind that increased exposure to UV light will contribute \nto skin cancer development. \n \nSkin monitoring \n \nBecause this medicine increases eumelanin, in most treated patients the skin will darken. This is an \nexpected response to this medicine, and the darkening will slowly fade unless another implant is used. \n \nYour doctor will need to regularly check your skin (full body) to monitor changes in moles (e.g. \ndarkening) or other skin abnormalities. This is recommended to be performed every 6 months. \n \nPlease inform your doctor about new or changing skin abnormalities. Arrange for an early \nappointment with your porphyria specialist if pigmented lesions like moles grow or if other growing, \nnon-healing, weeping, plaque-like, wart-like, or ulcerated lesions appear. A referral to a dermatology \nspecialist might be necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThis medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not \nbeen tested in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and SCENESSE \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking anticoagulant medicines used to prevent blood clots. These may \ninclude warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and \nlower fever or to prevent blood clotting) and a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drug (NSAIDs), used to treat common ailments, such as arthritis, headaches, mild fever, \nrheumatism and sore throats. This is because patients taking such medicines may experience increased \nbruising or bleeding at the site of the implant. \n \nPregnancy and breastfeeding \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, you \nshould not receive SCENESSE, since it is not known how it will affect your unborn baby or the \nbreastfed infant. \n \nWomen who could become pregnant should use adequate contraception such as oral contraceptives, \ndiaphragm plus spermicide, intrauterine device (also known as a coil) during treatment and for three \nmonths after the last SCENESSE implantation. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThere is a risk of feeling drowsy and tired when using this medicine, especially within 72 hours of \nadministration. If you are affected, do not drive or use any tools or machines. If you suffer from \ncontinued drowsiness, then you should speak to your doctor. \n \n \n3. How to use SCENESSE \n \nThe implant will be inserted by a doctor who has been trained in the administration procedure. The \ndoctor will decide with you the most suitable time and the site for inserting the implant. \n \nOne implant is injected every 2 months during the spring and summer months. Three implants per year \nare recommended, depending on the length of effect required. However, this number should not \nexceed more than 4 per year. \n \nThe implant is given as injection under your skin using a catheter tube and needle (subcutaneous use). \nBefore inserting this medicine, your doctor may decide to give you a local anaesthetic to numb the \narea where the implant is to be inserted. The implant is inserted directly under the skin folds on your \nwaist or abdomen in an area known as the supra-iliac crest. \n \nAt the end of the insertion procedure, you may be able to feel the implant under your skin. Over time \nthe implant will be absorbed by the body, this will happen within 50 to 60 days after implantation. \n \nIf you experience discomfort and are concerned, speak to your doctor. The implant may be removed \nby a simple surgical procedure if needed. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following side effects are considered to be: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- Nausea (feeling sick), \n- headache; \n- reactions at the implant site including pain, redness, itching, bruising and changes to colour of \noverlying skin. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n- General changes to the skin including freckles and skin darkening; \n- migraine (a severe headache); \n- back pain; \n- abdominal (tummy) pain, \n- diarrhoea and vomiting, \n\n\n\n24 \n\n- decreased appetite; \n- fatigue (tiredness), \n- dizziness, drowsiness and weakness; \n- hot flushes; \n- upper respiratory tract infections (colds). \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \n- Infected hair follicle, fungal infection, urinary tract infection \n\n \n- Chills, fever, flu, flu-like illness, blocked nose, blocked sinuses, inflamed nose and throat, nose \n\ninflammation \n \n- Depression, inability to sleep, poor quality sleep, fainting, fainting sensation, fall, hangover, \n\nweakness, inability to get legs comfortable, increased sensitivity to touch, headache following \ninjury, burning sensation, abnormal taste sensation \n\n \n- Swollen eye lids, red eyes, dry eye, difficulty focusing on close objects, ringing in ears \n\n \n- Palpitations, fast heart rate, bruising, high blood pressure, difficulty to make some sounds \n\n \n- Inflamed lips, lip swelling, colouration on lip, gum pain, toothache, discoloured gums, reduced \n\nsense of touch in mouth, lip discolouration, tongue discolouration \n \n\n- Increased hunger, nausea following implant insertion, indigestion, infection in stomach and \nintestines, inflamed stomach and intestines, heartburn, inflamed stomach, irregular bowel \nmovements, wind, bloated tummy, tummy pain \n\n \n- Irregularity of skin, rash with small blisters, itch, rash, red rash, red swelling on skin, rash with \n\nsmall bumps, itchy rash, skin irritation, lighter skin patches, acne, eczema, secretions on skin, skin \npeeling, skin with loss of colour, hair colour changes, excessive sweating \n\n \n- Joint pain, muscle pain, pain in arms and legs, sudden muscle contraction, pain in muscles and \n\nbones, stiffness of muscles and bones, joint stiffness, groin pain, feeling of heaviness, swelling in \nlower limbs \n\n \n- Heavy and prolonged period, abnormal period, breast tenderness, irregular periods, discharge from \n\nvagina, decreased sex drive \n \n- Pain, swelling around site of implantation, bruising at injection site, irritation at injection site, \n\nenlargement at implant site, itching at implant site, implant falling out, change in colour of skin at \nimplant site \n\n \n- Decrease white blood cells, abnormal liver function tests, decreased iron binding, increased \n\ncholesterol, increased sugar level, decreased blood iron level, increased blood pressure, blood in \nurine \n\n \n- Wound complication, open wound \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.

Always verify the presence of the implant, if in \ndoubt of its presence, check whether the implant has remained in the catheter. If the implant has \nnot been administered during the procedural steps described above, discard the implant and \nadminister a new implant. Do not administer a new implant unless it has been unequivocally \nconfirmed that the first one had not been inserted. \n\n- Apply a small pressure dressing to the injection site. \n- Observe the patient for 30 minutes to ensure that you will notice if the patient develops an \n\nallergic or hypersensitivity reaction (immediate type). \n \n\nThe implant can be surgically removed if needed. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
