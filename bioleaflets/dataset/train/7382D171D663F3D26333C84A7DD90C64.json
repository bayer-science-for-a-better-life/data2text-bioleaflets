NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nPossia 90 mg film coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film coated tablet contains 90 mg ticagrelor. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\n \n\nRound, biconvex, yellow tablets marked with \u201890\u2019 above \u2018T\u2019 on one side and plain on the other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nPossia, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of \n\natherothrombotic events in adult patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes (unstable angina, non ST \n\nelevation Myocardial Infarction [NSTEMI] or ST elevation Myocardial Infarction [STEMI]); \n\nincluding patients managed medically, and those who are managed with percutaneous coronary \n\nintervention (PCI) or coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG). \n\n \n\nFor further information, please refer to section 5.1. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nPossia treatment should be initiated with a single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and then \n\ncontinued at 90 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nPatients taking Possia should also take ASA daily, unless specifically contraindicated. Following an \n\ninitial dose of ASA, Possia should be used with a maintenance dose of ASA of 75-150 mg (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\nTreatment is recommended for up to 12 months unless discontinuation of Possia is clinically indicated \n\n(see section 5.1). Experience beyond 12 months is limited. \n\n \n\nIn patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), premature discontinuation with any antiplatelet \n\ntherapy, including Possia, could result in an increased risk of cardiovascular death, or myocardial \n\ninfarction due to the patient\u2019s underlying disease. Therefore, premature discontinuation of treatment \n\nshould be avoided. \n\n \n\nLapses in therapy should also be avoided. A patient who misses a dose of Possia should take only one \n\n90 mg tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time. \n\n \n\nPatients treated with clopidogrel can be directly switched to Possia if needed (see section 5.1). \n\nSwitching from prasugrel to Possia has not been investigated. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nElderly  patients \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). No information \n\nis available concerning treatment of patients on renal dialysis and therefore Possia is not recommended \n\nin these patients. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Possia has not been \n\nstudied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Its use in patients with moderate to \n\nsevere hepatic impairment is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \nThe safety and efficacy of Possia in children below the age of 18 in the approved adult indication has \n\nnot been established. No data are available (see section 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nFor oral use. Possia can be administered with or without food. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsection 4.8). \n\n\uf0b7 Active pathological bleeding. \n\n\uf0b7 History of intracranial haemorrhage (see section 4.8). \n\n\uf0b7 Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n\uf0b7 Co-administration of ticagrelor with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, \nclarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir) is contraindicated, as co-administration \n\nmay lead to a substantial increase in exposure to ticagrelor (see section 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nBleeding risk \n\nIn the phase 3 pivotal trial (PLATO [PLATelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes], 18,624 patients) key \n\nexclusion criteria included an increased risk for bleeding, clinically important thrombocytopenia or \n\nanaemia, previous intracranial bleed, gastrointestinal bleed within the past 6 months or major surgery \n\nwithin the past 30 days. Patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with Possia and ASA showed \n\nan increased risk of non-CABG major bleeding and also more generally in bleeds requiring medical \n\nattention i.e. Major + Minor PLATO bleeds, but not Fatal or Life-threatening bleeds (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nTherefore, the use of Possia in patients at known increased risk for bleeding should be balanced \n\nagainst the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events. If clinically indicated, Possia \n\nshould be used with caution in the following patient groups: \n\n\uf0b7 Patients with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, coagulation \ndisorders, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding). The use of Possia is contraindicated in \n\npatients with active pathological bleeding, in those with a history of intracranial haemorrhage, \n\nand in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n\uf0b7 Patients with concomitant administration of medicinal products that may increase the risk of \n\nbleeding (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral anticoagulants and/or \n\nfibrinolytics) within 24 hours of Possia dosing. \n\n \n\nNo data exist with Possia regarding a haemostatic benefit of platelet transfusions; circulating Possia \n\nmay inhibit transfused platelets. Since co-administration of Possia with desmopressin did not decrease \n\ntemplate-bleeding time, desmopressin is unlikely to be effective in managing clinical bleeding events \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nAntifibrinolytic therapy (aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and/or recombinant factor VIIa may \n\nincrease haemostasis. Possia may be resumed after the cause of bleeding has been identified and \n\ncontrolled. \n\n \n\nSurgery \n\nPatients should be advised to inform physicians and dentists that they are taking Possia before any \n\nsurgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken. \n\n \nIn PLATO patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), Possia had more bleeding \n\nthan clopidogrel when stopped within 1 day prior to surgery but a similar rate of major bleeds \n\ncompared to clopidogrel after stopping therapy 2 or more days before surgery (see section 4.8). If a \n\npatient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is not desired, Possia should be \n\ndiscontinued 7 days prior to surgery (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPatients at risk for bradycardic events \n\nDue to observations of mostly asymptomatic ventricular pauses in an earlier clinical study, patients \n\nwith an increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g. patients without a pacemaker who have sick sinus \n\nsyndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block or bradycardic-related syncope) were excluded from the main \n\nPLATO study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Possia. Therefore, due to the limited clinical \n\nexperience, Possia should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nIn addition, caution should be exercised when administering Possia concomitantly with medicinal \n\nproducts known to induce bradycardia. However no evidence of clinically significant adverse \n\nreactions was observed in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or more \n\nmedicinal products known to induce bradycardia (e.g., 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium channel \n\nblockers diltiazem and verapamil, and 4% digoxin) (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nDuring the Holter substudy in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses >3 seconds with \n\nticagrelor than with clopidogrel during the acute phase of their ACS. The increase in Holter-detected \n\nventricular pauses with ticagrelor was higher in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) than in the \n\noverall study population during the acute phase of ACS, but not at one month with ticagrelor or \n\ncompared to clopidogrel. There were no adverse clinical consequences associated with this imbalance \n\n(including syncope or pacemaker insertion) in this patient population (see section 5.1). \n\n \nDyspnoea \n\nDyspnoea was reported by 13.8% of patients treated with Possia and by 7.8% of patients treated with \n\nclopidogrel. In 2.2% of patients, investigators considered the dyspnoea causally related to treatment \n\nwith Possia. It is usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolves without need for treatment \n\ndiscontinuation. Patients with asthma/COPD may have an increased absolute risk of experiencing \n\ndyspnoea with Possia (see section 4.8). Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients with history \n\nof asthma and/or COPD. The mechanism has not been elucidated. If a patient reports new, prolonged \n\nor worsened dyspnoea this should be investigated fully and if not tolerated, treatment with Possia \n\nshould be stopped. \n\n \n\nCreatinine elevations \n\nCreatinine levels may increase during treatment with Possia (see section 4.8). The mechanism has not \n\nbeen elucidated. Renal function should be checked after one month and thereafter according to routine \n\nmedical practice, paying special attention to patients \u2265 75 years, patients with moderate/severe renal \n\nimpairment and those receiving concomitant treatment with an ARB. \n\n \n\nUric acid increase \n\nIn PLATO study, patients on ticagrelor had a higher risk of hyperuricaemia than those patients \n\nreceiving clopidogrel (see section 4.8). Caution should be exercised when administering ticagrelor to \n\npatients with history of hyperuricaemia or gouty arthritis. As a precautionary measure, the use of \n\nticagrelor in patients with uric acid nephropathy is discouraged. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nOther \n\nBased on a relationship observed in PLATO between maintenance ASA dose and relative efficacy of \n\nticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, co-administration of Possia and high maintenance dose ASA \n\n(>300 mg) is not recommended (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nCo-administration of Possia with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, \n\nnefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir) is contraindicated (see section 4.3 and 4.5). Co-administration \n\nmay lead to a substantial increase in Possia exposure (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCo-administration of ticagrelor with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, dexamethasone, \n\nphenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) is discouraged, as co-administration may lead to a \n\ndecrease in exposure and efficacy of ticagrelor (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCo-administration of Possia and CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices (i.e., cisapride \n\nand ergot alkaloids) is not recommended, as ticagrelor may increase the exposure to these medicinal \n\nproducts (see section 4.5). The concomitant use of Possia with doses of simvastatin or lovastatin \n\ngreater than 40 mg is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nClose clinical and laboratory monitoring is recommended when giving digoxin concomitantly with \n\nPossia (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nNo data are available on concomitant use of Possia with potent P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors (e.g. \n\nverapamil, quinidine, cyclosporin) that may increase ticagrelor exposure. If the association cannot be \n\navoided, their concomitant use should be made with caution (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nTicagrelor is primarily a CYP3A4 substrate and a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Ticagrelor is also a P-gp \n\nsubstrate and a weak P-gp inhibitor and may increase the exposure of P-gp substrates. \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on Possia \n\n \n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4 \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \u2013 Co-administration of ketoconazole with ticagrelor increased the \nticagrelor Cmax and AUC equal to 2.4-fold and 7.3-fold, respectively. The Cmax and AUC of the \n\nactive metabolite were reduced by 89% and 56%, respectively. Other strong inhibitors of \n\nCYP3A4 (clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir) would be expected to have \n\nsimilar effects and their concomitant use with Possia is contraindicated (see section 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors \u2013 Co-administration of diltiazem with ticagrelor increased the \nticagrelor Cmax by 69% and AUC to 2.7 fold and decreased the active metabolite Cmax by 38% \n\nand AUC was unchanged. There was no effect of ticagrelor on diltiazem plasma levels. Other \n\nmoderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir, aprepitant, erythromycin and fluconazole) would \n\nbe expected to have a similar effect and can as well be co-administered with Possia.  \n\n \n\nCYP3A inducers \nCo-administration of rifampicin with ticagrelor decreased ticagrelor Cmax and AUC by 73% and \n\n86%, respectively. The Cmax of the active metabolite was unchanged and the AUC was decreased by \n\n46%, respectively. Other CYP3A inducers (e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine and \n\nphenobarbital) would be expected to decrease the exposure to Possia as well. Co-administration of \n\nticagrelor with potent CYP3A inducers may decrease exposure and efficacy of ticagrelor  (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \nOthers \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nClinical pharmacology interaction studies showed that co-administration of ticagrelor with heparin, \n\nenoxaparin and ASA or desmopressin did not have any effect on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor or \n\nthe active metabolite or on ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with ticagrelor alone. If \n\nclinically indicated, medicinal products that alter haemostasis should be used with caution in \n\ncombination with Possia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNo data are available on concomitant use of Possia with potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, \n\nquinidine, cyclosporin) that may increase ticagrelor exposure. If clinically indicated, their concomitant \n\nuse should be made with caution (see section 4.4). \n\n \nEffects of Possia on other medicinal products \n\n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4 \n\n\uf0b7 Simvastatin \u2013 Co-administration of ticagrelor with simvastatin increased simvastatin Cmax by \n81% and AUC by 56% and increased simvastatin acid Cmax by 64% and AUC by 52% with \n\nsome individual increases equal to 2 to 3 fold. Co-administration of ticagrelor with doses of \n\nsimvastatin exceeding 40 mg daily could cause adverse effects of simvastatin and should be \n\nweighed against potential benefits. There was no effect of simvastatin on ticagrelor plasma \n\nlevels. Possia may have similar effect on lovastatin. The concomitant use of Possia with doses \n\nof simvastatin or lovastatin greater than 40 mg is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n\uf0b7 Atorvastatin - Co-administration of atorvastatin and ticagrelor increased atorvastatin acid Cmax \nby 23% and AUC by 36%. Similar increases in AUC and Cmax were observed for all atorvastatin \n\nacid metabolites. These increases are not considered clinically significant. \n\n\uf0b7 A similar effect on other statins metabolised by CYP3A4 cannot be excluded. Patients in \nPLATO receiving ticagrelor took a variety of statins, with no concern of an association with \n\nstatin safety among the 93% of the PLATO cohort taking these medicinal products.  \n\n \n\nTicagrelor is a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor. Co-administration of Possia and CYP3A4 substrates with \n\nnarrow therapeutic indices (i.e., cisapride or ergot alkaloids) is not recommended, as ticagrelor may \n\nincrease the exposure to these medicinal products (see section 4.4). \n\n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 \n\nCo-administration of Possia with tolbutamide resulted in no change in the plasma levels of either \n\nmedicinal product, which suggest that ticagrelor is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor and unlikely to alter the \n\nCYP2C9 mediated metabolism of medicinal products like warfarin and tolbutamide. \n\n \n\nOral contraceptives \nCo-administration of Possia and levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol increased ethinyl estradiol \n\nexposure approximately 20% but did not alter the pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel. No clinically \n\nrelevant effect on oral contraceptive efficacy is expected when levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol are \n\nco-administered with Possia. \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates (including digoxin, cyclosporin)  \nConcomitant administration of Possia increased the digoxin Cmax by 75% and AUC by 28%. The mean \n\ntrough digoxin levels were increased about 30% with ticagrelor co-administration with some \n\nindividual maximum increases to 2 fold. In the presence of digoxin, the Cmax and AUC of ticagrelor \n\nand its active metabolite were not affected. Therefore, appropriate clinical and/or laboratory \n\nmonitoring is recommended when giving narrow therapeutic index P-gp dependent medicinal products \n\nlike digoxin or cyclosporin concomitantly with Possia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nOther concomitant therapy \n\n \n\nMedicinal products known to induce bradycardia \n\nDue to observations of mostly asymptomatic ventricular pauses and bradycardia, caution should be \n\nexercised when administering Possia concomitantly with medicinal products known to induce \n\nbradycardia (see section 4.4). However no evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions was \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nobserved in the PLATO trial after concomitant administration with one or more medicinal products \n\nknown to induce bradycardia (e.g., 96% beta blockers, 33% calcium channel blockers diltiazem and \n\nverapamil, and 4% digoxin). \n\n \n\nIn the PLATO study, Possia was commonly administered with ASA, proton pump inhibitors, statins, \n\nbeta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as needed \n\nfor concomitant conditions for long-term and also heparin, low molecular weight heparin and \n\nintravenous GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors for short durations (see section 5.1). No evidence of clinically \n\nsignificant adverse interactions with these medicinal products was observed. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of Possia with heparin, enoxaparin or desmopressin had no effect on activated \n\npartial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated coagulation time (ACT) or factor Xa assays. However, \n\ndue to potential pharmacodynamic interactions, caution should be exercised with the concomitant \n\nadministration of Possia with medicinal products known to alter haemostasis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDue to reports of cutaneous bleeding abnormalities with SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine, sertraline and \n\ncitalopram), caution is advised when administering SSRIs with Possia as this may increase the risk of \n\nbleeding. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use appropriate contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy \n\nduring Possia therapy. \n\n \nPregnancy \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ticagrelor in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Possia is not recommended during \n\npregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ticagrelor and its \n\nactive metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

However, \n\nmore PLATO combined Major + Minor bleeding occurred with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. \n\nFew patients in PLATO had fatal bleeds: 20 (0.2%) for ticagrelor and 23 (0.3%) for clopidogrel (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nAge, sex, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy, and medical \n\nhistory, including a previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, all did not predict either overall or \n\nnon-procedural PLATO Major bleeding. Thus no particular group was identified at risk for any subset \n\nof bleeding. \n\n \n\nCABG-related bleeding: In PLATO, 42% of the 1584 patients (12% of cohort) who underwent \n\ncoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery had a PLATO Major Fatal/Life-threatening bleeding \n\nwith no difference between treatment groups. Fatal CABG bleeding occurred in 6 patients in each \n\ntreatment group (see section 4.4). \n\n \nNon-CABG related bleeding and non-procedural related bleeding: Possia and clopidogrel did not \n\ndiffer in non-CABG PLATO-defined Major Fatal/Life-threatening bleeding, but PLATO-defined \n\nTotal Major, TIMI Major, and TIMI Major + Minor bleeding were more common with ticagrelor. \n\nSimilarly, when removing all procedure related bleeds, more bleeding occurred with ticagrelor than \n\nwith clopidogrel (Table 2). Discontinuation of treatment due to non-procedural bleeding was more \n\ncommon for ticagrelor (2.9%) than for clopidogrel (1.2%; p<0.001). \n\n \n\nIntracranial bleeding: There were more intracranial non-procedural bleeds with ticagrelor \n\n(n=27 bleeds in 26 patients, 0.3%) than with clopidogrel (n=14 bleeds,  0.2%), of which 11 bleeds  \n\nwith ticagrelor and 1 with clopidogrel were fatal. There was no difference in overall fatal bleeds. \n \n\nDyspnoea \n\nDyspnoea, a sensation of breathlessness, is reported by patients treated with Possia. Dyspnoea adverse \n\nevents ( AEs) (dyspnoea, dyspnoea at rest, dyspnoea exertional, dyspnoea paroxysmal nocturnal and \n\nnocturnal dyspnoea), when combined, was reported by 13.8% of patients treated with ticagrelor and by \n\n7.8% of patients treated with clopidogrel. In 2.2% of patients taking ticagrelor and by 0.6% taking \n\nclopidogrel investigators considered the dyspnoea causally related to treatment in the PLATO study \n\nand few were serious (0.14% ticagrelor; 0.02% clopidogrel), (see section 4.4). Most reported \n\nsymptoms of dyspnoea were mild to moderate in intensity, and most were reported as a single episode \n\nearly after starting treatment.  \n\n \n\nCompared with clopidogrel, patients with asthma/COPD treated with ticagrelor may have an increased \n\nrisk of experiencing non-serious dyspnoea (3.29% ticagrelor versus 0.53% clopidogrel) and serious \n\ndyspnoea (0.38% ticagrelor versus 0.00% clopidogrel). In absolute terms, this risk was higher than in \n\nthe overall PLATO population. Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients with history of \n\nasthma and/or COPD (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAbout 30% of episodes resolved within 7 days. PLATO included patients with baseline congestive \n\nheart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma; these patients, and the elderly, were \n\nmore likely to report dyspnoea. For Possia, 0.9% of patients discontinued study drug because of \n\ndyspnoea compared with 0.1% taking clopidogrel. The higher incidence of dyspnoea with Possia is not \n\nassociated with new or worsening heart or lung disease (see section 4.4). Possia does not affect tests of \n\npulmonary function. \n\n \n\nInvestigations  \n\nCreatinine elevations: In PLATO, serum creatinine concentration significantly increased by >30% in \n\n25.5% of patients receiving ticagrelor compared to 21.3% of patients receiving clopidogrel and \n\nby >50% in 8.3% of patients receiving ticagrelor compared to 6.7% of patients receiving clopidogrel. \n\nCreatinine elevations by >50% were more pronounced in patients > 75 years (ticagrelor 13.6% versus \n\nclopidogrel 8.8%), in patients with severe renal impairment at baseline (ticagrelor 17.8% versus \n\nclopidogrel 12.5%) and in patients receiving concomitant treatment with ARBs (ticagrelor 11.2% \n\nversus clopidogrel 7.1%). Within these subgroups renal-related serious adverse events and adverse \n\nevents leading to discontinuation of study drug were similar between treatment groups. The totality of \n\nrenal AEs reported were 4.9% for ticagrelor vs. 3.8% for clopidogrel, however a similar percent of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\npatients reported events considered by the investigators as causally related to treatment; 54 (0.6%) for \n\nticagrelor and 43 (0.5%) for clopidogrel. \n\n \n\nUric acid elevations: In PLATO, serum uric acid concentration increased to more than upper limit of \n\nnormal in 22% of patients receiving ticagrelor compared to 13% of patients receiving clopidogrel. \n\nMean serum uric acid concentration increased approximately 15% with ticagrelor compared to \n\napproximately 7.5% with clopidogrel and after treatment was stopped, decreased to approximately \n\n7% on ticagrelor but with no decrease observed for clopidogrel. The hyperuricaemia AEs reported \n\nwere 0.5% for ticagrelor vs. 0.2% for clopidogrel. Of these AEs 0.05% for ticagrelor vs. 0.02% for \n\nclopidogrel were considered causally related by investigators. For gouty arthritis, the AEs reported \n\nwere 0.2% for ticagrelor vs 0.1% for clopidogrel; none of these adverse events were assessed as \n\ncausally related by investigators. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \nTicagrelor is well tolerated in single doses up to 900 mg. Gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-limiting in \n\na single ascending dose study. Other clinically meaningful adverse reactions which may occur with \n\noverdose include dyspnoea and ventricular pauses (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn the event of overdose, observe for these potential adverse reactions and consider ECG monitoring \n\n \n\nThere is currently no known antidote to reverse the effects of Possia, and Possia is not expected to be \n\ndialysable (see section 4.4). Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. The \n\nexpected effect of excessive Possia dosing is prolonged duration of bleeding risk associated with \n\nplatelet inhibition. If bleeding occurs appropriate supportive measures should be taken. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, ATC code: B01AC24 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nPossia contains ticagrelor a member of the chemical class cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidines (CPTP), \n\nwhich is a selective adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist acting on the P2Y12 \n\nADP-receptor that can prevent ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Ticagrelor is orally \n\nactive, and reversibly interacts with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor. Ticagrelor does not interact with \n\nthe ADP binding site itself, but interacts with platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal \n\ntransduction. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nOnset of Action \n\nIn patients with stable coronary artery disease on ASA, ticagrelor demonstrates a rapid onset of \n\npharmacological effect as demonstrated by a mean Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation (IPA) for \n\nticagrelor at 0.5 hours after 180 mg loading dose of about 41%, with the maximum IPA effect of \n\n89% by 2-4 hours post dose, and maintained between 2-8 hours. 90% of patients had final extent IPA \n\n>70% by 2 hours post dose. \n \n\nOffset of Action \n\nIf a CABG procedure is planned, ticagrelor bleeding risk is increased compared to clopidogrel when \n\ndiscontinued within less than 96 hours prior to procedure. \n\n \n\nSwitching data \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nSwitching from clopidogrel to ticagrelor results in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and switching \n\nfrom ticagrelor to clopidogrel results in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be switched \n\nfrom clopidogrel to ticagrelor without any interruption of antiplatelet effect (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe PLATO study included 18,624 patients who presented within 24 hours of onset of symptoms of \n\nunstable angina (UA), non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST elevation myocardial \n\ninfarction (STEMI), and were initially managed medically, or with percutaneous coronary intervention \n\n(PCI), or with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (see section 4.1). \n\n \n\nOn a background of daily ASA, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily showed superiority to 75 mg daily \n\nclopidogrel in preventing the composite endpoint of cardiovascular [CV] death, myocardial infarction \n\n[MI], or stroke, with the difference driven by CV death and MI. Patients received a 300 mg loading \n\ndose of clopidogrel (600 mg possible if having PCI) or 180 mg of ticagrelor. \n\n \n\nThe result appeared early (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 0.6% and Relative Risk Reduction [RRR] of \n\n12% at 30 days), with a constant treatment effect over the entire 12 month period, yielding ARR \n\n1.9% per year with RRR of 16%. This suggests it is appropriate to treat patients with ticagrelor for up \n\nto 12 months (see section 4.2). Treating 54 ACS patients with ticagrelor instead of clopidogrel will \n\nprevent 1 atherothrombotic event; treating 91 will prevent 1 CV death (see Figure 1 and Table 3). \n\n \n\nThe treatment effect of ticagrelor over clopidogrel appears consistent across many subgroups, \n\nincluding weight; sex; medical history of diabetes mellitus, transient ischaemic attack or non-\n\nhaemorrhagic stroke, or revascularisation; concomitant therapies including heparins, GpIIb/IIIa \n\ninhibitors and proton pump inhibitors (see section 4.5); final index event diagnosis (STEMI, NSTEMI, \n\nor UA); and, treatment pathway intended at randomisation (invasive or medical). \n\n \n\nA weakly significant treatment interaction was observed with region whereby the HR for the primary \n\nendpoint favours ticagrelor in the rest of world but favours clopidogrel in North America, which \n\nrepresented approximately 10% of the overall population studied (interaction p-value=0.045).  \n\nExploratory analyses suggest a possible association with ASA dose such that reduced efficacy was \n\nobserved with ticagrelor with increasing ASA doses. Chronic daily ASA doses to accompany Possia \n\nshould be 75-150 mg (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \nFigure 1 shows the estimate of the risk to the first occurrence of any event in the composite efficacy \n\nendpoint. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Time to first occurrence of CV death, MI and Stroke (PLATO) \n\n \n\nPossia reduced the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint compared to clopidogrel in both the \n\nUA/NSTEMI and STEMI population (Table 3). \n\n \n\nTable 3 -Outcome Events in PLATO \n\n Possia \n\n(% patients \n\nwith event) \n\nN=9333 \n\nClopidogrel \n\n(% patients \n\nwith event) \n\nN=9291 \n\n \n\n \n\nARR\na \n\n(%/yr) \n\n \n\n \n\nRRR\na\n (%) \n\n(95% CI) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nP \n\nCV death, MI (excl. \n\nsilent MI) or stroke \n\n \n\n9.3 \n\n \n\n10.9 \n\n \n\n1.9 \n\n \n\n16 (8, 23) \n\n \n\n0.0003 \n\nInvasive intent\n \n\n8.5 10.0 1.7 16 (6, 25) 0.0025 \n\nMedical intent\n \n\n11.3 13.2 2.3 15 (0.3, 27) 0.0444\nd\n \n\nCV death 3.8 4.8 1.1 21 (9, 31) 0.0013 \n\nMI (excl. silent MI)\nb\n 5.4 6.4 1.1 16 (5, 25) 0.0045 \n\nStroke 1.3 1.1 -0.2 -17 (-52, 9) 0.2249 \n\nAll cause mortality, \n\nMI (excl. silent MI), \n\nor stroke \n\n \n\n \n\n9.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n11.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n16 (8, 23) \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0001 \n\nCV death, total MI, \n\nstroke, SRI, RI, TIA, \n\nor other ATE\nc \n\n \n\n \n\n13.8 \n\n \n\n \n\n15.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n12 (5, 19) \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0006 \n\n All-cause \n\nmortality \n\n \n\n4.3 \n\n \n\n5.4 \n\n \n\n1.4 \n\n \n\n22 (11, 31) \n\n \n\n0.0003\nd\n \n\nDefinite stent \n\nthrombosis \n\n \n\n1.2 \n\n \n\n1.7 \n\n \n\n0.6 \n\n \n\n32 (8, 49) \n\n \n\n0.0123\nd \n\naARR = absolute risk reduction; RRR = relative risk reduction = (1-Hazard ratio) x 100%.

The \n\nprimary variable of interest was the occurrence of ventricular pauses \u22653 seconds. More patients had \n\nventricular pauses with ticagrelor (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; and \n\n2.2% and 1.6% respectively after 1 month (see section 4.4). The increase in ventricular pauses in the \n\nacute phase of ACS was more pronounced in ticagrelor patients with history of CHF (9.2% versus \n\n5.4% in patients without CHF history; for clopidogrel patients, 4.0% in those with versus 3.6% in \n\nthose without CHF history) This imbalance did not occur at one month: 2.0% versus 2.1% for \n\nticagrelor patients with and without CHF history respectively; and 3.8% versus 1.4% with clopidogrel. \n\nThere were no adverse clinical consequences associated with this imbalance (including pacemaker \n\ninsertions) in this population of patients. \n\n \n\nPLATO genetic substudy \n\nCYP2C19 and ABCB1 genotyping of 10,285 patients in PLATO provided associations of genotype \n\ngroups with PLATO outcomes. The superiority of ticagrelor over clopidogrel in reducing major CV \n\nevents was not significantly affected by patient CYP2C19 or ABCB1 genotype. Similar to the overall \n\nPLATO study, total PLATO Major bleeding did not differ between ticagrelor and clopidogrel, \n\nregardless of CYP2C19 or ABCB1 genotype. Non-CABG PLATO Major bleeding was increased with \n\nticagrelor compared clopidogrel in patients with one or more CYP2C19 loss of function alleles, but \n\nsimilar to clopidogrel in patients with no loss of function allele. \n\n \n\nCombined efficacy and safety composite \n\nA combined efficacy and safety composite (CV death, MI, stroke, or PLATO-defined \u2018Total Major\u2019 \n\nbleeding) indicates that the benefit in efficacy of Possia compared to clopidogrel is not offset by the \n\nmajor bleeding events (ARR 1.4%, RRR 8%, HR 0.92; p=0.0257) over 12 months after ACS. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Possia \n\nin all subsets of the paediatric population in the granted indication (see section 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nTicagrelor demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics and exposure to ticagrelor and the active metabolite \n\n(AR-C124910XX) are approximately dose proportional up to 1260 mg. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAbsorption of ticagrelor is rapid with a median tmax of approximately 1.5 hours. The formation of the \n\nmajor circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (also active) from ticagrelor is rapid with a median tmax \n\nof approximately 2.5 hours. Following oral administration of ticagrelor 90 mg under fasted conditions, \n\nCmax is 529 ng/ml and AUC is 3451 ng*h/ml. The metabolite parent ratios are 0.28 for Cmax and 0.42 \n\nfor AUC. \n\n \nThe mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor was estimated to be 36%. Ingestion of a high-fat meal \n\nresulted in a 21% increase in ticagrelor AUC and 22% decrease in the active metabolite Cmax but had \n\nno effect on ticagrelor Cmax or the AUC of the active metabolite. These small changes are considered \n\nof minimal clinical significance; therefore, ticagrelor can be given with or without food. Ticagrelor as \n\nwell as the active metabolite are P-gp substrates. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\nThe steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 87.5 l. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite is \n\nextensively bound to human plasma protein (>99.0%). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nCYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of the active \n\nmetabolite and their interactions with other CYP3A substrates ranges from activation through to \n\ninhibition.  \n \n\nThe major metabolite of ticagrelor is AR-C124910XX, which is also active as assessed by in vitro \n\nbinding to the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is \n\napproximately 30-40% of that obtained for ticagrelor. \n\n \n\nElimination \nThe primary route of ticagrelor elimination is via hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is \n\nadministered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (57.8% in faeces, 26.5% in \n\nurine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. \n\nThe primary route of elimination for the active metabolite is most likely via biliary secretion. The \n\nmean t1/2 was approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 8.5 hours for the active metabolite. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nHigher exposures to ticagrelor (approximately 25% for both Cmax and AUC) and the active metabolite \n\nwere observed in elderly (\u2265 75years) ACS patients compared to younger patients by the population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis. These differences are not considered clinically significant (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric \n\nTicagrelor has not been evaluated in a paediatric population (see section 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nGender \nHigher exposures to ticagrelor and the active metabolite were observed in women compared to men. \n\nThese differences are not considered clinically significant. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \nExposure to ticagrelor and the active metabolite were approximately 20% lower in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \nCmax and AUC for ticagrelor were 12% and 23% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment \n\ncompared to matched healthy subjects, respectively (see section 4.2). Ticagrelor has not been studied \n\nin patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and its use in these patients is contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nEthnicity \nPatients of Asian descent have a 39% higher mean bioavailability compared to Caucasian patients. \n\nPatients self-identified as Black had an 18% lower bioavailability of ticagrelor compared to Caucasian \n\npatients. In clinical pharmacology studies, the exposure (Cmax and AUC) to ticagrelor in Japanese \n\nsubjects was approximately 40% (20% after adjusting for body weight) higher compared to that in \n\nCaucasians. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nPreclinical data for ticagrelor and its major metabolite have not demonstrated unacceptable risk for \n\nadverse effects for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single and repeated \n\ndose toxicity and genotoxic potential. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal irritation was observed in several animal species at clinical relevant exposure levels \n\n(see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn female rats, ticagrelor at high dose showed an increased incidence of uterine tumors \n\n(adenocarcinomas) and an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas. The mechanism for uterine \n\ntumors is likely hormonal imbalance which can lead to tumors in rats. The mechanism for the hepatic \n\nadenomas is likely due to a rodent-specific enzyme induction in the liver. Thus, the carcinogenicity \n\nfindings are considered unlikely to be relevant for humans. \n\n \n\nIn rats minor developmental anomalies were seen at a maternal toxic dose (safety margin of 5.1). In \n\nrabbits a slight delay in hepatic maturity and skeletal development was seen in foetuses from dams at \n\nhigh dose without showing maternal toxicity (safety margin of 4.5). \n\n \n\nStudies in rats and rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity, with slightly reduced maternal body \n\nweight gain and reduced neonatal viability and birth weight, with delayed growth. Ticagrelor produced \n\nirregular cycles (mostly extended cycles) in female rats, but did not affect overall fertility in male and \n\nfemale rats. Pharmacokinetic studies performed with radio-labeled ticagrelor have shown that the \n\nparent compound and its metabolites are excreted in the milk of rats (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Possia is and what it is used for  \n \n\nWhat Possia is \n\nPossia contains the active substance called ticagrelor. This belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nanti-platelet medicines. \n\n \n\nHow Possia works \n\nPossia affects cells called \u2018platelets\u2019 (also called thrombocytes). These very small blood cells help stop \n\nbleeding by clumping together to plug tiny holes in blood vessels that are cut or damaged.  \n \n\nHowever, platelets can also form clots inside diseased blood vessels in the heart and brain. This can be \n\nvery dangerous because: \n\n\uf0b7 the clot can cut off the blood supply completely - this can cause a heart attack (myocardial \n\ninfarction) or stroke, or \n\n\uf0b7 the clot can partly block the blood vessels to the heart - this reduces the blood flow to the heart \nand can cause chest pain which comes and goes (called \u2018unstable angina\u2019). \n\n \n\nPossia helps stop the clumping of platelets. This reduces the chance of a blood clot forming that can \n\nreduce blood flow. \n\n \n\nWhat Possia is used for \n\nPossia is to be used in adults only. You have been given Possia because you have had: \n\n\uf0b7 a heart attack, or \n\n\uf0b7 unstable angina (angina or chest pain that is not well controlled). \n\nPossia reduces the chances of you having another heart attack or a stroke or of dying from a disease \n\nrelated to your heart or blood vessels. \n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Possia \n\n \n\nDo not take Possia if: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n30 \n\n\uf0b7 You are allergic (hypersensitive) to ticagrelor or any of the other ingredients of Possia (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n\uf0b7 You are bleeding now or have bled recently inside your body, such as bleeding in your stomach \n\nor gut from an ulcer. \n\n\uf0b7 You have moderate to severe liver disease \n\n\uf0b7 You are taking any of the following medicines: ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections), \nclarithromycin (used to treat bacterial infections), nefazodone (an antidepressant), ritonavir and \n\natazanavir (used to treat HIV infection and AIDS). \n\n\uf0b7 You have had a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain. \nDo not take Possia if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \n\npharmacist before taking Possia. \n\n \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nCheck with your doctor, pharmacist or dentist before taking Possia if: \n\n\uf0b7 You have an increased risk of bleeding because of: \n\n- a recent serious injury \n\n- recent surgery (including dental work) \n\n- you have a condition that affects blood clotting \n\n- recent bleeding from your stomach or gut (such as a stomach ulcer or colon \u2018polyps\u2019) \n\n\uf0b7 You are due to have surgery (including dental work) at any time while taking Possia. This is \n\nbecause of the increased risk of bleeding. Your doctor may want you to stop taking Possia 7 \n\ndays prior to surgery. \n\n\uf0b7 Your heart rate is abnormally low (usually lower than 60 beats per minute) and you do not \n\nalready have in place a device that paces your heart (pacemaker). \n\n\uf0b7 You have asthma or other lung problem or breathing difficulties. \n\n\uf0b7 You have had a blood test that showed more than the usual amount of uric acid \n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or dentist before \n\ntaking Possia. \n\n \n\nChildren \n\nPossia is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Possia \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes medicines that you buy without a prescription, dietary supplements and \n\nherbal remedies. This is because Possia can affect the way some medicines work and some medicines \n\ncan have an effect on Possia. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n\uf0b7 more than 40 mg daily of either simvastatin or lovastatin (medicines used to treat high \ncholesterol) \n\n\uf0b7 rifampicin (an antibiotic), phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (used to control \nseizures), dexamethasone (used to treat inflammatory and auto immune conditions), digoxin \n\n(used to treat heart failure), cyclosporin (used to lessen your body\u2019s defenses), quinidine and \n\ndiltiazem (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms), beta blockers and verapamil (used to treat high \n\nblood pressure). \n\n \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines that \n\nincrease your risk of bleeding: \n\n\uf0b7 \u2018oral anticoagulants\u2019 often referred to as \u2019blood thinners\u2019 which include warfarin. \n\n\uf0b7 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (abbreviated as NSAIDs) often taken as pain killers such \nas ibuprofen and naproxen. \n\n\uf0b7 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (abbreviated as SSRIs) taken as antidepressants such as \nparoxetine, sertraline and citalopram \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\n\uf0b7 other medicines such as ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections), clarithromycin (used to \ntreat bacterial infections), nefazodone, (an antidepressant), ritonavir and atazanavir (used to treat \n\nHIV infection and AIDS), cisapride (used to treat heartburn), ergot alkaloids (used to treat \n\nmigraines and headaches). \n\n \n\nAlso tell your doctor that because you are taking Possia, you may have an increased risk of bleeding if \n\nyour doctor gives you fibrinolytics, often called \u2018clot dissolvers\u2019, such as streptokinase or alteplase. \n\n \n\nTaking Possia with food and drink \n\nYou can take Possia with or without food. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIt is not recommended to use Possia if you are pregnant or may become pregnant. Women should use \n\nappropriate contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy while taking this medicine. \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Possia if you are breast-feeding. Your doctor will discuss with you \n\nthe benefits and risks of taking Possia during this time. \n\n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine, if you are pregnant or breast-\n\nfeeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nPossia is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Possia \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n \n\nHow much to take \n\n\uf0b7 The starting dose is two tablets at the same time (loading dose of 180 mg). This dose will \nusually be given to you in the hospital. \n\n\uf0b7 After this starting dose, the usual dose is one tablet of 90 mg twice a day for up to 12 months \nunless your doctor tells you differently. Take Possia around the same time everyday (for \n\nexample, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening). \n\n \n\nYour doctor will usually also tell you to take acetylsalicylic acid. This is a substance present in many \n\nmedicines used to prevent blood clotting. Your doctor will tell you how much to take (usually between \n\n75-150 mg daily). \n\n \n\nHow to take Possia \n\n\uf0b7 You can take the tablet with or without food. \n\n\uf0b7 You can check when you last took a tablet of Possia by looking on the blister. There is a sun \n\n(for the morning) and a moon (for the evening).

of medicines called anti-platelet medicines. how possia works possia affects cells called 'platelets' (also called thrombocytes). these very small blood cells help stop bleeding by clumping together to plug tiny holes in blood vessels that are cut or damaged. however, platelets can also form clots inside diseased blood vessels in the heart and brain. this can be very dangerous because: the clot can cut off the blood supply completely - this can cause a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke, or the clot can partly block the blood vessels to the heart - this reduces the blood flow to the heart and can cause chest pain which comes and goes (called 'unstable angina'). possia helps stop the clumping of platelets. this reduces the chance of a blood clot forming that can reduce blood flow. what possia is used for possia is to be used in adults only. you have been given possia because you have had: a heart attack, or unstable angina (angina or chest pain that is not well controlled). possia reduces the chances of you having another heart attack or a stroke or of dying from a disease related to your heart or blood vessels.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "possia",
