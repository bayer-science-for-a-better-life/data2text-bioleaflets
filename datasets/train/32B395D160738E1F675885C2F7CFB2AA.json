This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTerrosa 20 micrograms/80 microliters solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach dose of 80 microliters contains 20 micrograms of teriparatide*. \n \nOne cartridge of 2.4 mL of solution contains 600 micrograms of teriparatide (corresponding to \n250 micrograms per mL). \n \n*Teriparatide, rhPTH(1-34), produced in E. coli, using recombinant DNA technology, is identical to \nthe 34-N-terminal amino acid sequence of endogenous human parathyroid hormone. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nColourless, clear solution for injection with a pH of 3.8 \u2013 4.5. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTerrosa is indicated in adults. \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture (see \nsection 5.1). In postmenopausal women, a significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and \nnon-vertebral fractures but not hip fractures has been demonstrated. \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and \nmen at increased risk for fracture (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nThe recommended dose of Terrosa is 20 micrograms administered once daily. \nPosology \n\n \nPatients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D supplements if dietary intake is \ninadequate. \n \nThe maximum total duration of treatment with teriparatide should be 24 months (see section 4.4). The \n24-month course of teriparatide should not be repeated over a patient\u2019s lifetime. \n \nFollowing cessation of teriparatide therapy, patients may be continued on other osteoporosis therapies. \n \nSpecial populations \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nTeriparatide must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). In patients \nwith moderate renal impairment, teriparatide should be used with caution. No special caution is \nrequired for patients with mild renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo data are available in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 5.3). Therefore, \nteriparatide should be used with caution. \n \nPaediatric population and young adults with open epiphyses \nThe safety and efficacy of teriparatide in children and adolescents less than 18 years have not been \nestablished. Teriparatide should not be used in paediatric patients (less than 18 years), or young adults \nwith open epiphyses. \n \nElderly \nDosage adjustment based on age is not required (see section 5.2). \n \n\nTerrosa should be administered once daily by subcutaneous injection in the thigh or abdomen. \nMethod of administration \n\n \nIt should be administered exclusively with the Terrosa Pen reusable, multidose medicine delivery \nsystem and the injection needles which are listed as compatible in the instructions which are provided \nwith the pen. The pen and injection needles are not included with Terrosa. However, for the treatment \ninitiation a cartridge and pen pack should be used containing one carton of Terrosa cartridge and one \ncarton of Terrosa Pen. Terrosa must not be used with any other pen. \nPatients must be trained to use the proper injection techniques (see section 6.6). An instruction for use \nwhich is included in the carton of the delivery system is also available to instruct patients on the \ncorrect use of the pen. \n \nThe date of first injection should also be written on the outer carton of Terrosa (see the provided space \non the box: {First use:}). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n- Pre-existing hypercalcaemia. \n- Severe renal impairment. \n- Metabolic bone diseases (including hyperparathyroidism and Paget\u2019s disease of the bone) other \n\nthan primary osteoporosis or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. \n- Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase. \n- Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy to the skeleton. \n- Patients with skeletal malignancies or bone metastases should be excluded from treatment with \n\nteriparatide. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nIn normocalcaemic patients, slight and transient elevations of serum calcium concentrations have been \nobserved following teriparatide injection. Serum calcium concentrations reach a maximum between 4 \nand 6 hours and return to baseline by 16 to 24 hours after each dose of teriparatide. Therefore, if blood \nsamples for serum calcium measurements are taken, this should be done at least 16 hours after the \nmost recent teriparatide injection. Routine calcium monitoring during therapy is not required. \n\nSerum and urine calcium \n\n \nTeriparatide may cause small increases in urinary calcium excretion, but the incidence of \nhypercalciuria did not differ from that in the placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nTeriparatide has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. Teriparatide should be used with \ncaution in patients with active or recent urolithiasis because of the potential to exacerbate this \ncondition. \n\nUrolithiasis \n\n \n\nIn short-term clinical studies with teriparatide, isolated episodes of transient orthostatic hypotension \nwere observed. Typically, an event began within 4 hours of dosing and spontaneously resolved within \na few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the \nfirst several doses, was relieved by placing subjects in a reclining position, and did not preclude \ncontinued treatment. \n\nOrthostatic hypotension \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised in patients with moderate renal impairment. \nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nExperience in the younger adult population, including premenopausal women, is limited (see section \n5.1). Treatment should only be initiated if the benefit clearly outweighs risks in this population. \n\nYounger adult population \n\n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of \nteriparatide. If pregnancy occurs, teriparatide should be discontinued. \n \n\nStudies in rats indicate an increased incidence of osteosarcoma with long-term administration of \nteriparatide (see section 5.3). Until further clinical data become available, the recommended treatment \ntime of 24 months should not be exceeded. \n\nDuration of treatment \n\n \n\nBatch (Lot) number of each cartridge and the date of its first injection should be recorded by the \npatient on a calendar. \n\nDocumentation \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\nExcipient \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a study of 15 healthy subjects administered digoxin daily to steady state, a single teriparatide dose \ndid not alter the cardiac effect of digoxin. However, sporadic case reports have suggested that \nhypercalcaemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide transiently increases \nserum calcium, teriparatide should be used with caution in patients taking digitalis. \n \nTeriparatide has been evaluated in pharmacodynamic interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide. No \nclinically significant interactions were noted. \n \nCo-administration of raloxifene or hormone replacement therapy with teriparatide did not alter the \neffects of teriparatide on serum or urine calcium or on clinical adverse events. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of \nteriparatide. If pregnancy occurs, Terrosa should be discontinued. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in females \n\n \n\nTerrosa is contraindicated for use during pregnancy (see section 4.3). \nPregnancy \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nTerrosa is contraindicated for use during breast-feeding. It is not known whether teriparatide is \nexcreted in human milk. \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nStudies in rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The effect of teriparatide on \nhuman foetal development has not been studied. The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nFertility \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTeriparatide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Transient, \northostatic hypotension or dizziness was observed in some patients. These patients should refrain from \ndriving or the use of machines until symptoms have subsided. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with teriparatide are nausea, pain in \nlimb, headache and dizziness. \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nOf patients in the teriparatide trials, 82.8% of the teriparatide patients and 84.5% of the placebo \npatients reported at least 1 adverse event. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \nThe adverse reactions associated with the use of teriparatide in osteoporosis clinical trials and post-\nmarketing exposure are summarised in the table below. \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions: very common \n(\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), and rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000). \n \nOrgan System \nClass \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare \n \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n Anaemia   \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Anaphylaxis  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hypercholesterol-\naemia \n\nHypercalcaemia \ngreater than \n2.76 mmol/L, \nhyperuricaemia  \n\nHypercalcaemia \ngreater than \n3.25 mmol/L \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Depression    \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Dizziness, \nheadache, \nsciatica, syncope \n\n  \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders  \n\n Vertigo    \n\nCardiac disorders  Palpitations Tachycardia  \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypotension   \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nOrgan System \nClass \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare \n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Dyspnoea Emphysema  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea, vomiting, \nhiatus hernia, \ngastro-\noesophageal \nreflux disease  \n\nHaemorrhoids  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Sweating \nincreased  \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nPain in limb  Muscle cramps  Myalgia, \narthralgia, back \ncramp/pain* \n\n \n\nRenal and \nurinary disorders  \n\n  Urinary \nincontinence, \npolyuria, \nmicturition \nurgency, \nnephrolithiasis \n\nRenal \nfailure/impairment \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite condition \n\n Fatigue, chest \npain, asthenia, \nmild and transient \ninjection site \nevents, including \npain, swelling, \nerythema, \nlocalised bruising, \npruritus and \nminor bleeding at \ninjection site \n\nInjection site \nerythema, \ninjection site \nreaction \n\nPossible allergic \nevents soon after \ninjection: acute \ndyspnoea, \noro/facial oedema, \ngeneralised \nurticaria, chest \npain, oedema \n(mainly peripheral) \n\nInvestigations  \n \n\n  Weight increased, \ncardiac murmur, \nalkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased  \n\n \n\n*Serious cases of back cramp or pain have been reported within minutes of the injection. \n \n\nIn clinical trials the following reactions were reported at a \u22651% difference in frequency from placebo: \nvertigo, nausea, pain in limb, dizziness, depression, dyspnoea. \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \nTeriparatide increases serum uric acid concentrations. In clinical trials, 2.8% of teriparatide patients \nhad serum uric acid concentrations above the upper limit of normal compared with 0.7% of placebo \npatients. However, the hyperuricaemia did not result in an increase in gout, arthralgia, or urolithiasis. \n \nIn a large clinical trial, antibodies that cross-reacted with teriparatide were detected in 2.8% of women \nreceiving teriparatide. Generally, antibodies were first detected following 12 months of treatment and \ndiminished after withdrawal of therapy. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions, allergic \nreactions, effects on serum calcium, or effects on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) response. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nTeriparatide has been administered in single doses of up to 100 micrograms and in repeated doses of \nup to 60 micrograms/day for 6 weeks. \n\nSigns and symptoms \n\nThe effects of overdose that might be expected include delayed hypercalcaemia and risk of orthostatic \nhypotension. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache can also occur. \n \n\nIn post-marketing spontaneous reports, there have been cases of medication error where the entire \ncontents (up to 800 micrograms) of a teriparatide pen have been administered as a single dose. \nTransient events reported have included nausea, weakness/lethargy and hypotension. In some cases, \nno adverse events occurred as a result of the overdose. No fatalities associated with overdose have \nbeen reported. \n\nOverdose experience based on post-marketing spontaneous reports \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote for teriparatide. Treatment of suspected overdose should include \ntransitory discontinuation of teriparatide, monitoring of serum calcium, and implementation of \nappropriate supportive measures, such as hydration. \n\nOverdose management \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC code: \nH05AA02 \n \nTerrosa is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \n\nEndogenous 84-amino-acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and \nphosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Teriparatide (rhPTH(1-34)) is the active fragment (1-34) of \nendogenous human parathyroid hormone. Physiological actions of PTH include stimulation of bone \nformation by direct effects on bone forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal \nabsorption of calcium and increasing the tubular re-absorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate \nby the kidney. \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTeriparatide is a bone formation agent to treat osteoporosis. The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend \nupon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide increases apposition \nof new bone on trabecular and cortical bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic \nactivity over osteoclastic activity. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nRisk factors \nClinical efficacy \n\nIndependent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fracture, family \nhistory of hip fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to \nidentify women and men at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures who could benefit from treatment. \n \nPremenopausal women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis should be considered at high risk for \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\ufffd\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nfracture if they have a prevalent fracture or a combination of risk factors that place them at high risk \nfor fracture (e.g., low bone density [e.g., T-score \u2264\u22122], sustained high dose glucocorticoid therapy \n[e.g., \u22657.5 mg/day for at least 6 months], high underlying disease activity, low sex steroid levels). \n \nPostmenopausal osteoporosis \nThe pivotal study included 1,637 postmenopausal women (mean age 69.5 years). At baseline, ninety \npercent of the patients had one or more vertebral fractures, and on average, vertebral BMD was \n0.82 g/cm2 (equivalent to a T-score = - 2.6). All patients were offered 1000 mg calcium per day and at \nleast 400 IU vitamin D per day. Results from up to 24 months (median: 19 months) treatment with \nteriparatide demonstrate statistically significant fracture reduction (Table 1). To prevent one or more \nnew vertebral fractures, 11 women had to be treated for a median of 19 months. \n \nTable 1 \n\nFracture incidence in postmenopausal women \n \n Placebo \n\n(N = 544) (%) \nTeriparatide \n\n(N = 541) (%) \nRelative risk (95% CI) \n\nvs. placebo \nNew vertebral \nfracture (\u22651) a \n\n14.3 5.0 b 0.35 \n(0.22, 0.55) \n\nMultiple vertebral \nfractures (\u22652) a \n\n4.9 1.1 b 0.23 \n(0.09, 0.60) \n\nNon-vertebral fragility \nfractures c \n\n5.5% 2.6% d 0.47 \n(0.25, 0.87) \n\nMajor non-vertebral \nfragility fracturesc (hip, \nradius, humerus, ribs \nand pelvis) \n\n3.9% 1.5% d 0.38 \n(0.17, 0.86) \n\n \nAbbreviations: N = number of patients randomly assigned to each treatment group; CI = confidence \ninterval. \na The incidence of vertebral fractures was assessed in 448 placebo and 444 teriparatide patients who \nhad baseline and follow-up spine radiographs. \nb p\u22640.001 compared with placebo. \nc A significant reduction in the incidence of hip fractures has not been demonstrated. \nd p\u22640.025 compared with placebo. \n \nAfter 19 months (median) treatment, bone mineral density (BMD) had increased in the lumbar spine \nand total hip, respectively, by 9% and 4% compared with placebo (p<0.001). \n \nPost-treatment management: Following treatment with teriparatide, 1,262 postmenopausal women \nfrom the pivotal trial enrolled in a post-treatment follow-up study. The primary objective of the study \nwas to collect safety data of teriparatide. During this observational period, other osteoporosis \ntreatments were allowed and additional assessment of vertebral fractures was performed. \n \nDuring a median of 18 months following discontinuation of teriparatide, there was a 41% reduction \n(p=0.004) compared with placebo in the number of patients with a minimum of one new vertebral \nfracture. \n \nIn an open-label study, 503 postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis and a fragility fracture \nwithin the previous 3 years (83% had received previous osteoporosis therapy) were treated with \nteriparatide for up to 24 months. At 24 months, the mean increase from baseline in lumbar spine, total \nhip and femoral neck BMD was 10.5%, 2.6 % and 3.9% respectively. The mean increase in BMD \nfrom 18 to 24 months was 1.4%, 1.2%, and 1.6% at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, \nrespectively. \n \nA 24-month, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled Phase 4 study included 1,360 \npostmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. 680 subjects were randomised to teriparatide \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nand 680 subjects were randomised to oral risedronate 35 mg/week. At baseline, the women had a \nmean age of 72.1 years and a median of 2 prevalent vertebral fractures; 57.9% of patients had received \nprevious bisphosphonate therapy and 18.8% took concomitant glucocorticoids during the study. 1,013 \n(74.5%) patients completed the 24-month follow-up. The mean (median) cumulative dose of \nglucocorticoid was 474.3 (66.2) mg in the teriparatide arm and 898.0 (100.0) mg in the risedronate \narm. The mean (median) vitamin D intake for the teriparatide arm was 1433 IU/day (1400 IU/day) and \nfor the risedronate arm was 1191 IU/day (900 IU/day). For those subjects who had baseline and \nfollow-up spine radiographs, the incidence of new vertebral fractures was 28/516 (5.4%) in \nteriparatide- and 64/533 (12.0%) in risedronate-treated patients, relative risk (95% CI) = 0.44 (0.29-\n0.68), p<0.0001. The cumulative incidence of pooled clinical fractures (clinical vertebral and non \nvertebral fractures) was 4.8% in teriparatide and 9.8% in risedronate-treated patients, hazard ratio \n(95% CI) = 0.48 (0.32-0.74), p=0.0009. \n \nMale osteoporosis \n437 patients (mean age 58.7 years) were enrolled in a clinical trial for men with hypogonadal (defined \nas low morning free testosterone or an elevated FSH or LH) or idiopathic osteoporosis. Baseline spinal \nand femoral neck bone mineral density mean T-scores were -2.2 and -2.1, respectively. At baseline, \n35% of patients had a vertebral fracture and 59% had a non-vertebral fracture. \n \nAll patients were offered 1000 mg calcium per day and at least 400 IU vitamin D per day. Lumbar \nspine BMD significantly increased by 3 months. After 12 months, BMD had increased in the lumbar \nspine and total hip by 5% and 1%, respectively, compared with placebo. However, no significant \neffect on fracture rates was demonstrated. \n \nGlucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis \nThe efficacy of teriparatide in men and women (N=428) receiving sustained systemic glucocorticoid \ntherapy (equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone for at least 3 months) was demonstrated in the 18-\nmonth primary phase of a 36-month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled study \n(alendronate 10 mg/day). Twenty-eight percent of patients had one or more radiographic vertebral \nfractures at baseline. All patients were offered 1000 mg calcium per day and 800 IU vitamin D per \nday. \nThis study included postmenopausal women (N=277), premenopausal women (N=67), and men \n(N=83). At baseline, the postmenopausal women had a mean age of 61 years, mean lumbar spine \nBMD T score of \u22122.7, median prednisone equivalent dose of 7.5 mg/day, and 34% had one or more \nradiographic vertebral fractures; premenopausal women had a mean age of 37 years, mean lumbar \nspine BMD T score of \u22122.5, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 9% had one or \nmore radiographic vertebral fractures; and men had a mean age of 57 years, mean lumbar spine BMD \nT score of \u22122.2, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 24% had one or more \nradiographic vertebral fractures. \n \nSixty-nine percent of patients completed the 18-month primary phase. At the 18 month endpoint, \nteriparatide significantly increased lumbar spine BMD (7.2%) compared with alendronate (3.4%) \n(p<0.001). Teriparatide increased BMD at the total hip (3.6%) compared with alendronate (2.2%) \n(p<0.01), as well as at the femoral neck (3.7%) compared with alendronate (2.1%) (p<0.05). In \npatients treated with teriparatide, lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD increased between 18 \nand 24 months by an additional 1.7%, 0.9%, and 0.4%, respectively. \n \nAt 36 months, analysis of spinal X-rays from 169 alendronate patients and 173 teriparatide patients \nshowed that 13 patients in the alendronate group (7.7%) had experienced a new vertebral fracture \ncompared with 3 patients in the teriparatide group (1.7%) (p=0.01). In addition, 15 of 214 patients in \nthe alendronate group (7.0%) had experienced a non-vertebral fracture compared with 16 of 214 \npatients in the teriparatide group (7.5%) (p=0.84). \n \nIn premenopausal women, the increase in BMD from baseline to 18 month endpoint was significantly \ngreater in the teriparatide group compared with the alendronate group at the lumbar spine (4.2% \nversus \u22121.9%; p<0.001) and total hip (3.8% versus 0.9%; p=0.005). However, no significant effect on \nfracture rates was demonstrated. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 1.7 L/kg. The half-life of teriparatide is approximately \n1 hour when administered subcutaneously, which reflects the time required for absorption from the \ninjection site. \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nNo metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with teriparatide but the peripheral \nmetabolism of parathyroid hormone is believed to occur predominantly in liver and kidney. \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nTeriparatide is eliminated through hepatic and extra-hepatic clearance (approximately 62 L/hr in \nwomen and 94 L/hr in men). \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nNo differences in teriparatide pharmacokinetics were detected with regard to age (range 31 to 85 \nyears). Dosage adjustment based on age is not required. \n\nElderly \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nTeriparatide was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests. It produced no teratogenic effects in rats, \nmice or rabbits. There were no important effects observed in pregnant rats or mice administered \nteriparatide at daily doses of 30 to 1000 micrograms/kg. However, foetal resorption and reduced litter \nsize occurred in pregnant rabbits administered daily doses of 3 to 100 micrograms/kg. The \nembryotoxicity observed in rabbits may be related to their much greater sensitivity to the effects of \nPTH on blood ionised calcium compared with rodents. \n \nRats treated with near-life time daily injections had dose-dependent exaggerated bone formation and \nincreased incidence of osteosarcoma most probably due to an epigenetic mechanism. Teriparatide did \nnot increase the incidence of any other type of neoplasia in rats. Due to the differences in bone \nphysiology in rats and humans, the clinical relevance of these findings is probably minor. No bone \ntumours were observed in ovariectomised monkeys treated for 18 months or during a 3-year follow-up \nperiod after treatment cessation. In addition, no osteosarcomas have been observed in clinical trials or \nduring the post treatment follow-up study. \n \nAnimal studies have shown that severely reduced hepatic blood flow decreases exposure of PTH to the \nprincipal cleavage system (Kupffer cells) and consequently clearance of PTH(1-84). \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nTerrosa 20 micrograms/80 microliters solution for injection \nTeriparatide \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Terrosa is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Terrosa \n3. How to use Terrosa \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How to store Terrosa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Terrosa is and what it is used for \n \nTerrosa contains the active substance teriparatide that is used to make the bones stronger, and to \nreduce the risk of fractures by stimulating bone formation. \n \nTerrosa is used to treat osteoporosis in adults. Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to \nbecome thin and fragile. This disease is especially common in women after the menopause, but it can \nalso occur in men. Osteoporosis is also common in patients receiving medicines called corticosteroids. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Terrosa \n \nDo not use Terrosa: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to teriparatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\u2022 if you have high levels of calcium in your blood (hypercalcaemia). \n\u2022 if you suffer from serious kidney problems. \n\u2022 if you have ever had bone cancer or if other cancers have spread (metastasised) to your bones. \n\u2022 if you have certain bone diseases. If you have a bone disease, tell your doctor. \n\u2022 if you have unexplained high levels of alkaline phosphatase in your blood, which means you \n\nmight have Paget\u2019s disease of bone (disease with abnormal bone changes). If you are not sure, \nask your doctor. \n\n\u2022 if you have had radiation therapy involving your bones. \n\u2022 if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nWarning and precautions \nTerrosa may increase calcium in your blood or urine. \nTalk to your doctor before or while using Terrosa: \n\u2022 if you have continuing nausea, vomiting, constipation, low energy, or muscle weakness. These \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nmay be signs there is too much calcium in your blood. \n\u2022 if you suffer from kidney stones or have had kidney stones. \n\u2022 if you suffer from kidney problems (moderate renal impairment). \n \nSome patients get dizzy or get a fast heartbeat after the first few doses of Terrosa. For the first doses, \ninject Terrosa in a place where you can sit or lie down right away if you get dizzy. \n \nThe recommended treatment time of 24 months should not be exceeded. \n \nBefore inserting a cartridge in Terrosa Pen write down the batch (Lot) number of the cartridge and its \nfirst injection date on a calendar. The date of first injection should also be recorded on the outer carton \nof Terrosa (see the provided space on the box: {First use:}) (see section 3.). \n \nTerrosa should not be used in growing adults. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTerrosa should not be used in children and adolescents (aged less than 18 years). \n \nOther medicines and Terrosa \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nThis is important, because some medicines (e.g. digoxin/digitalis, a medicine used to treat heart \ndisease) may interact with teriparatide. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Terrosa if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are a woman of child-bearing \npotential, you should use effective methods of contraception during use of Terrosa. If you become \npregnant while using Terrosa, Terrosa should be discontinued. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for \nadvice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome patients may feel dizzy after injecting Terrosa. If you feel dizzy you should not drive or use \nmachines until you feel better. \n \nTerrosa contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use Terrosa \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is 20 micrograms (corresponding to 80 microliters) given once a day by \ninjection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in the thigh or abdomen. \nTo help you remember to take your medicine, inject it at about the same time each day. Terrosa can be \ninjected at meal times. Inject Terrosa each day for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. The \ntotal duration of treatment with Terrosa should not exceed 24 months. You should not receive more \nthan one treatment course of 24 months over your lifetime. \nYour doctor may advise you to take Terrosa with calcium and vitamin D. Your doctor will tell you \nhow much you should take each day. \n \nTerrosa can be given with or without food. \n \nTerrosa cartridges are designed to be used only with the Terrosa Pen reusable, multidose delivery \nsystem and compatible pen needles. The pen and injection needles are not included with Terrosa. \nHowever, for treatment initiation a cartridge and pen pack should be used containing one carton of \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nTerrosa cartridge and one carton of Terrosa Pen. \n \nBefore the first use, insert the cartridge into the pen. For the correct use of this medicine it is very \nimportant to closely follow the detailed Instructions for Use of your pen which are provided with the \npen. \n \nUse a new injection needle for each injection to prevent contamination and safely dispose of the \nneedle after use. \nNever store your pen with the needle attached. \nNever share your pen with others. \nDo not use your Terrosa Pen to inject any other medicine (e.g. insulin). \nThe pen is customised for use with Terrosa only. \nDo not refill the cartridge. \nDo not transfer the medicine into a syringe. \n \nYou should inject Terrosa shortly after you take the pen with inserted cartridge out of the refrigerator. \nPut the pen with inserted cartridge back into the refrigerator immediately after you have used it. Do \nnot remove the cartridge from the pen after each use. Store it in the cartridge sleeve during the whole \n28-day treatment period. \n \nPreparing the pen for use \n- To ensure the correct administration of Terrosa always read the Instructions for Use of Terrosa \n\nPen, which is included in the carton of the pen. \n- Wash your hands before handling the cartridge or pen. \n- Check the expiry date on the cartridge label before inserting the cartridge into the pen. Make \n\nsure that there are at least 28 days remaining before its expiry date. Insert the cartridge into the \npen before the first use as detailed in the pen instructions. Write down the batch (Lot) number of \neach cartridge and its first injection date on a calendar. The date of first injection should also be \nrecorded on the outer carton of Terrosa (see the provided space on the box: {First use:}). \n\n- After inserting a new cartridge and before the first injection from this cartridge prime the pen \naccording to the instructions which are provided. Do not prime again after the first dose. \n\n \nInjecting Terrosa \n- Before you inject Terrosa, clean your skin where you intend to inject (thigh or abdomen) as \n\ninstructed by your doctor. \n- Gently hold a fold of cleansed skin and insert the needle straight into the skin. Press the push \n\nbutton and hold it pressed in until the dose indication has returned to the start position. \n- After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for six seconds to make sure that you receive \n\nthe whole dose. \n- As soon as you have finished the injection, attach the outer needle protective cap on the pen \n\nneedle and screw the cap anti-clockwise to remove the pen needle. This will keep the remaining \nTerrosa sterile and prevent leaking from the pen. It will also stop air going back into the \ncartridge and the needle from clogging. \n\n- Replace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. \n \nIf you use more Terrosa than you should \nIf, by mistake, you have used more Terrosa than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist. \nThe expected effects of overdose include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. \n \nIf you forget to use Terrosa \nIf you forget an injection or cannot use your medicine at your usual time, inject it as soon as possible \non that day. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Do not take more than one \ninjection in the same day. \n \nIf you stop using Terrosa \nIf you are considering stopping Terrosa treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor \nwill advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Terrosa. \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

"Section_Content": "always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the recommended dose is 20 micrograms (corresponding to 80 microliters) given once a day by injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in the thigh or abdomen. to help you remember to take your medicine, inject it at about the same time each day. terrosa can be injected at meal times. inject terrosa each day for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. the total duration of treatment with terrosa should not exceed 24 months. you should not receive more than one treatment course of 24 months over your lifetime. your doctor may advise you to take terrosa with calcium and vitamin d. your doctor will tell you how much you should take each day. terrosa can be given with or without food. terrosa cartridges are designed to be used only with the terrosa pen reusable, multidose delivery system and compatible pen needles. the pen and injection needles are not included with terrosa. however, for treatment initiation a cartridge and pen pack should be used containing one carton of 28 terrosa cartridge and one carton of terrosa pen. before the first use, insert the cartridge into the pen. for the correct use of this medicine it is very important to closely follow the detailed instructions for use of your pen which are provided with the pen. use a new injection needle for each injection to prevent contamination and safely dispose of the needle after use. never store your pen with the needle attached. never share your pen with others. do not use your terrosa pen to inject any other medicine (e.g. insulin). the pen is customised for use with terrosa only. do not refill the cartridge. do not transfer the medicine into a syringe. you should inject terrosa shortly after you take the pen with inserted cartridge out of the refrigerator. put the pen with inserted cartridge back into the refrigerator immediately after you have used it. do not remove the cartridge from the pen after each use. store it in the cartridge sleeve during the whole 28-day treatment period. preparing the pen for use - to ensure the correct administration of terrosa always read the instructions for use of terrosa pen, which is included in the carton of the pen. - wash your hands before handling the cartridge or pen. - check the expiry date on the cartridge label before inserting the cartridge into the pen. make sure that there are at least 28 days remaining before its expiry date. insert the cartridge into the pen before the first use as detailed in the pen instructions. write down the batch (lot) number of each cartridge and its first injection date on a calendar. the date of first injection should also be recorded on the outer carton of terrosa (see the provided space on the box: {first use:}). - after inserting a new cartridge and before the first injection from this cartridge prime the pen according to the instructions which are provided. do not prime again after the first dose. injecting terrosa - before you inject terrosa, clean your skin where you intend to inject (thigh or abdomen) as instructed by your doctor. - gently hold a fold of cleansed skin and insert the needle straight into the skin. press the push button and hold it pressed in until the dose indication has returned to the start position. - after your injection, leave the needle in the skin for six seconds to make sure that you receive the whole dose. - as soon as you have finished the injection, attach the outer needle protective cap on the pen needle and screw the cap anti-clockwise to remove the pen needle. this will keep the remaining terrosa sterile and prevent leaking from the pen. it will also stop air going back into the cartridge and the needle from clogging. - replace the cap on your pen. leave the cartridge in the pen. if you use more terrosa than you should if, by mistake, you have used more terrosa than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist. the expected effects of overdose include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. if you forget to use terrosa if you forget an injection or cannot use your medicine at your usual time, inject it as soon as possible on that day. do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. do not take more than one injection in the same day. if you stop using terrosa if you are considering stopping terrosa treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with terrosa. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "terrosa", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},
