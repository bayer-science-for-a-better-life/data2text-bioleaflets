CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nHalimatoz in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n\u2022 the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been \ninadequate. \n\n\u2022 the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously \ntreated with methotrexate. \n\n \nHalimatoz can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when \ncontinued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \nAdalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray \nand to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nHalimatoz in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response \nto one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Halimatoz can be given as \nmonotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is \ninappropriate (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in \npatients aged less than 2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of \nage and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional \ntherapy (see section 5.1). \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who \nhave had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and / or MRI, \nwho have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate.  \n \nAdalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured \nby X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1) and to \nimprove physical function. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult \npatients who are candidates for systemic therapy. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and \nadolescents from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate \ncandidates for topical therapy and phototherapies. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n(acne inversa) in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to \nconventional systemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in adult patients \nwho have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and / or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and / or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to \nor have contraindications for such therapies. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult \npatients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and \n6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical \ncontraindications for such therapies. \n \nUveitis \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in \nadult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of \ncorticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nHalimatoz is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients \nfrom 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, \nor in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHalimatoz treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Halimatoz is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised \nto consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Halimatoz (see \nsection 4.4). Patients treated with Halimatoz should be given the Patient Reminder Card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Halimatoz if their \nphysician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. \n \nDuring treatment with Halimatoz, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and / or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Halimatoz for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg \nadalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \nMethotrexate should be continued during treatment with Halimatoz. \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nduring treatment with Halimatoz. Regarding combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \ndrugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Halimatoz 40 mg \nevery other week may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or \n80 mg every other week. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nDose interruption \n \nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs. \n \nAvailable data suggest that re-introduction of adalimumab after discontinuation for 70 days or \nlonger resulted in the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before \ndose interruption. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic \narthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Halimatoz for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nThe recommended dose of Halimatoz for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after \nthe initial dose. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n \nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Halimatoz 40 mg every other week may \nbenefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and \nrisks of continued 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered \nin a patient with an inadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate \nresponse is achieved with 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently \nbe reduced to 40 mg every other week. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe recommended Halimatoz dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is \n160 mg initially at Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day \nfor two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at Day 15 (given as two 40 mg \ninjections in one day). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg \nevery other week (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during \ntreatment with Halimatoz, if necessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical \nantiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with Halimatoz. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no \nimprovement within this time period.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nShould treatment be interrupted, Halimatoz 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be re-\nintroduced (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated \n(see section 5.1). \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease \n \nThe recommended Halimatoz induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely \nactive Crohn\u2019s disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. In case there is a need for a \nmore rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one \nday or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2 (given as two \n40 mg injections in one day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher \nduring induction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Halimatoz and signs and symptoms of disease \nrecur, Halimatoz may be re-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after \nmore than 8 weeks since the previous dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines.  \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Halimatoz 40 mg every other week \nmay benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg Halimatoz every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nThe recommended Halimatoz induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe \nulcerative colitis is 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg \ninjections per day for two consecutive days) and 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in \none day). After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via \nsubcutaneous injection. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines.  \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Halimatoz 40 mg every other week \nmay benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg Halimatoz every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 2\u20138 weeks of \ntreatment. Halimatoz therapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this \ntime period. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Halimatoz for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, \nfollowed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited \nexperience in the initiation of treatment with adalimumab alone. Treatment with Halimatoz can be \ninitiated in combination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory \nagents. Concomitant corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two \nweeks after initiating treatment with Halimatoz. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required.  \n \nRenal and / or hepatic impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Halimatoz for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nfrom 2 years of age is based on body weight (table 1). Halimatoz is administered every other week \nvia subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\nTable 1. Halimatoz dose for patients with  \npolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\n \nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n\n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this \ntime period. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Halimatoz for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is \nbased on body weight (table 2). Halimatoz is administered every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \n\nTable 2. Halimatoz dose for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Halimatoz dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is \nbased on body weight (table 3). Halimatoz is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nTable 3. Halimatoz dose for paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg \nInitial dose of 20 mg, followed by \n20 mg every other week starting \none week after the initial dose \n\n\u2265 30 kg \n\nInitial dose of 40 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week \n\nstarting one week after the initial \ndose \n\n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n \nIf re-treatment with adalimumab is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration \nshould be followed. \n \nThe safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean \nof 13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication.  \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. The posology of \nadalimumab in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Halimatoz dose is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at \nweek 1 via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Halimatoz 40 mg every other week, an increase in \ndosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Halimatoz if necessary. It is recommended that the \npatient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with \nHalimatoz. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period. \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Halimatoz may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data \nin section 5.1) \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Halimatoz for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is \nbased on body weight (table 4). Halimatoz is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\nTable 4. Halimatoz dose for paediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease \n\nPatient \nweight Induction dose \n\nMaintenance \ndose starting at \n\nweek 4 \n< 40 kg \u2022 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2 \n\n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with \nthe awareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with \nuse of the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n\n20 mg every \nother week \n\n\u2265 40 kg \u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n \nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with \nthe awareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with \nuse of the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 \n\n40 mg every \nother week \n\n \n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage.  \n \n\u2022 < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n\u2022 \u2265 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by week 12. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 6 years for this \nindication.  \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Halimatoz for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of \nage is based on body weight (table 5). Halimatoz is administered via subcutaneous \ninjection.  \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with adalimumab without concomitant \ntreatment with methotrexate. \n \n\nTable 5. Halimatoz dose for paediatric patients with uveitis \n \n\nPatient weight Dosing regimen \n\n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in combination with methotrexate \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week in combination with methotrexate \n \nWhen Halimatoz therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or \n80 mg for patients \u2265 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance \ntherapy. No clinical data are available on the use of an adalimumab loading dose in \nchildren < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \nThere is no relevant use of Halimatoz in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be \nevaluated on a yearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab in children aged 4\u201317 years have not yet been established. No \ndata are available.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in the paediatric population for the indications of \nankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHalimatoz is administered by subcutaneous injection.  \nFull instructions for use are provided in the package leaflet.   \n \nAdalimumab is available in other strengths and presentations.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections \n(see section 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III / IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function \nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Halimatoz. Because the \nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \nthis period. \n \nTreatment with Halimatoz should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic \nor localised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to \ntuberculosis and patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, \nsuch as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with \nHalimatoz should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Halimatoz should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Halimatoz should be \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\ndiscontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or \nantifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise \ncaution when considering the use of Halimatoz in patients with a history of recurring infection or with \nunderlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant \nimmunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving adalimumab. \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. \ndisseminated) tuberculosis. \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Halimatoz, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(\u201clatent\u201d) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of \npatient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. \nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Halimatoz therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit / risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \nconsidered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should \nbe consulted. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Halimatoz, and in accordance with local \nrecommendations. \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of \nHalimatoz in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test \nfor tuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an \nadequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \npatients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs / symptoms suggestive of a \ntuberculosis infection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) \noccur during or after therapy with Halimatoz. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients \nreceiving adalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking \nTNF-antagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in \nfatal outcomes.  \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, \ncough, dyspnoea, and / or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without \nconcomitant shock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of \nHalimatoz should be promptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal \ntherapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the \ncare of patients with invasive fungal infections. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including \nadalimumab, who are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have \nhad a fatal outcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with \nHalimatoz. For patients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with \nexpertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Halimatoz should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Halimatoz should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nNeurological events \n \nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and / or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \ndisease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the \nuse of Halimatoz in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Halimatoz should be considered if any of these \ndisorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central \ndemyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-\ninfectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Halimatoz therapy and regularly during \ntreatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of \nserious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab \nadministration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of \nHalimatoz should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was \nno evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, \nor change in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte / macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have \nbeen reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible \nrisk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a \nTNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually \nassociated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and \nadolescents treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in \nyoung adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for \ninflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine and Halimatoz should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of \nhepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Halimatoz cannot be excluded \n(see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional \ncaution should be exercised in considering Halimatoz treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non- \nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Halimatoz. Melanoma and Merkel cell \ncarcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab \n(see section 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly \nin the lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control \npatients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when \nusing any TNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy \ndue to heavy smoking. \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised \nto seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood \ndyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Halimatoz. Discontinuation of \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nHalimatoz therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic \nabnormalities. \n \nVaccinations \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza \ntrivalent virus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis \nwho were treated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary \ntransmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Halimatoz therapy. \n \nPatients on Halimatoz may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended \nfor 5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Halimatoz should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Halimatoz is contraindicated in \nmoderate to severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Halimatoz must be discontinued in \npatients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Halimatoz may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of \nlong-term treatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a \npatient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with \nHalimatoz and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with \nHalimatoz should not be given (see section 4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of \nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDs (e.g, anakinra and \nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. \nA patient who requires surgery while on Halimatoz should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic \nstricture that may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not \nworsen or cause strictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab-treated subjects over 65 years of age \n(3.7 %) was higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5 %). Some of those had a fatal outcome. \nParticular attention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with \nmethotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without \nmethotrexate resulted in increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy \nof adalimumab (see section 5.1). \n \nThe combination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n \nThe combination of adalimumab and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child bearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Halimatoz treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first \ntrimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated \nwith adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth \ndefects. The rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect \nwas 6/69 (8.7 %) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8 %) in the untreated \nwomen with RA (unadjusted OR 1.31, 95 % CI 0.38\u20134.52) and 16/152 (10.5 %) in the adalimumab-\ntreated women with CD and 3/32 (9.4 %) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, \n95 % CI 0.31\u20134.16). The adjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45\u2013\n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated \nand untreated women for the secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm \ndelivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were \nreported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, \nincluding small sample size and non-randomized design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not \navailable (see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended \nfor 5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in \nbreast milk at very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at \nconcentrations of 0.1 % to 1 % of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G \nproteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed \nnewborns / infants are anticipated. Consequently, Halimatoz can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHalimatoz may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and \nvisual impairment may occur following administration of Halimatoz (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to \n60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long \nstanding disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-\nrelated arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, \nhidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients \nreceiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled \nperiod. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9 % for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4 % for control-\ntreated patients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body\u2019s defence against infection and cancer.  \n \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV \nreactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been \nreported with use of adalimumab. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events \nand reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen \nin adult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on \npostmarketing experience and are displayed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency in table 6 \nbelow: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.  \n \nThe highest frequency seen among the various indications has been included.

consistent with the \nknown safety profile of adalimumab. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with adalimumab every other week was consistent \nwith the known safety profile of adalimumab. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab \ndeveloped injection site reactions (erythema and / or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), \ncompared to 7.2 % of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nnot necessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product. \n \nInfections \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \nthe adalimumab-treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved. \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab-treated patients and \n0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \npneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent \ndisease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years \nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 \npaediatric patients with an exposure of 498.1 patient years during adalimumab trials in paediatric \npatients with Crohn\u2019s disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an \nexposure of 80.0 patient years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque \npsoriasis. No malignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient \nyears during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration \nin patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \nsuppurativa, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n1,000 patient years among 5,291 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per \n1,000 patient years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for \nadalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95 % confidence interval) of \nnon-melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient years among adalimumab-treated \npatients and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, \nsquamous cell carcinomas occurred at rates (95 % confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 \npatient years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient years among \ncontrol patients. The rate (95 % confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 \npatient years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient years among \ncontrol patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over 26,439 \npatient years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma \nskin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma skin \ncancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is \napproximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient \ntreatment years. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\napproximately 0.2 and 0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nstudies I\u2013V. In these trials, 11.9 % of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1 % of placebo and \nactive control-treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive \ntitres at week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The \npatients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or \ncentral nervous system symptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nwith a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in \n3.7 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6 % of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \n\u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3 % of control-treated patients. \nMost ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN \noccurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 2 to < 4 years. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis \nwith a control period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9 % of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.9 % of controlled-treated patients. \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated \nefficacy and safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight \nadjusted induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in \n2.6 % (5 / 192) of patients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque Psoriasis with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8 % of adalimumab-\ntreated patients and 1.8 % of control-treated patients. \n \nNo ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients \nwith plaque psoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed by \n40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3 % of adalimumab-\ntreated patients and 0.6 % of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of \n166.5 days and 105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT \nelevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4 % of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4 % of control-treated \npatients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post- \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, \nsuch as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn\u2019s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine / 6-mercaptopurine compared \nwith adalimumab alone. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has \nbeen multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg / kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended \ndose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nHalimatoz is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1\u20130.2 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with \nadalimumab. In patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing \ninflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNF-\u03b1 was seen. \nEndoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab-\ntreated patients.  \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The \nefficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled \nstudies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration. \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses \nof 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo on \nalternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same duration. No \nother disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab every \nweek for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo \ninjections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-\nlabel extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab / MTX was administered every other week up to \n10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were \u2265 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-\nrheumatic drug-na\u00efve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy \nwas stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and / or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-na\u00efve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week / methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first \n104 weeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab \nwas administered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercentage of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in \nRA study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III \nand V had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as \ndetected by X-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life.  \n \nACR response \n \nThe percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent \nacross RA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in \ntable 7. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nTable 7 \nACR responses in placebo-controlled trials \n\n(percent of patients) \nresponse RA Study Ia** RA Study IIa** RA Study IIIa** \n\nplacebo / MTXc \nn = 60 \n\nadalimumabb / \nMTXc \nn = 63 \n\nplacebo \nn = 110 \n\nadalimumabb \nn = 113 \n\nplacebo / MTXc \nn = 200 \n\nadalimumabb / \nMTXc \nn = 207 \n\nACR 20 \n   6 months \n \n   12 months \n \n\n \n13.3 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n\n \n65.1 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n19.1 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n46.0 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n29.5 % \n\n \n24.0 % \n\n \n63.3 % \n\n \n58.9 % \n\n ACR 50 \n   6 months \n \n   12 months \n \n\n \n6.7 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n52.4 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n8.2 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n22.1 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n9.5 % \n\n \n9.5 % \n\n \n39.1 % \n\n \n41.5 % \n\nACR 70 \n   6 months \n \n   12 months \n\n \n3.3 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n23.8 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n1.8 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n12.4 % \n\n \nNA \n\n \n2.5 % \n\n \n4.5 % \n\n \n20.8 % \n\n \n23.2 % \n\na RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks, and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week \nc MTX = methotrexate \n** p < 0.01, adalimumab versus placebo \n  \n\nIn RA studies I\u2013IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and \nswollen joints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index \n(HAQ) scores and CRP (mg / dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA \nstudy III, these improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks. \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. \nAmong those, 86 patients (75.4 %) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2 %) had ACR 50 \nresponses; and 41 patients (36 %) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0 %) had ACR 20 \nresponses; 56 patients (69.1 %) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1 %) had ACR 70 \nresponses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care \nwas statistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care \n(p < 0.001). \n \nIn RA studies I\u2013IV, adalimumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 \nresponses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate na\u00efve, \ncombination therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater \nACR responses than methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52 and \nresponses were sustained at week 104 (see table 8). \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nTable 8  \nACR responses in RA study V  \n\n(percent of patients) \nresponse MTX \n\nn = 257 \nadalimumab \n\nn = 274 \nadalimumab / M\n\nTX \nn = 268 \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20 \nweek 52 62.6 % 54.4 % 72.8 % 0.013 < 0.001 0.043 \n\nweek 104 56.0 % 49.3 % 69.4 % 0.002 < 0.001 0.140 \n\nACR 50 \nweek 52 45.9 % 41.2 % 61.6 % < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317 \n\nweek 104 42.8 % 36.9 % 59.0 % < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162 \n\nACR 70 \nweek 52 27.2 % 25.9 % 45.5 % < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656 \n\nweek 104 28.4 % 28.1 % 46.6 % < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864 \n\na\n p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and \n\nadalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test. \nb\n p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and \n\nadalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and methotrexate \n\nmonotherapy using the Mann-Whitney U test \n\n \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for \nup to 10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 170 \npatients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients \n(90.6 %) had ACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7 %) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients \n(60.0 %) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nAt week 52, 42.9 % of patients who received adalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy \nachieved clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6) compared to 20.6 % of patients receiving methotrexate \nmonotherapy and 23.4% of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. \nAdalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to \nmethotrexate (p < 0.001) and adalimumab monotherapy (p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease \nstate in patients with recently diagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The response for \nthe two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447).  \nOf 342 subjects originally randomized to adalimumab monotherapy or adalimumab / methotrexate \ncombination therapy who entered the open-label extension study, 171 subjects completed 10 years \nof adalimumab treatment.

Adalimumab / methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less \nradiographic progression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see \ntable 9). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural \ndamage is maintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients \noriginally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. \nAmong those, 48 patients showed no progression of structural damage defined by a change from \nbaseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. At 10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically.

The corresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were \n31.3 %, 23.7 % and 36.7 % respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, which \nwas a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in RA study III. All doses / schedules of adalimumab \nin all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability index of the \nHAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was seen at week 52. \nResults from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses / schedules of adalimumab in all four \nstudies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component summary (PCS) scores, \nas well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 40 mg every other week dose. \nA statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional assessment of chronic illness \ntherapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was assessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued \ntreatment maintained improvement through week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. \nImprovement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was \nmaintained through that time. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for adalimumab / methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with \nactive polyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA \nonset types (most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended \noligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel-group study in 171 children (4\u201317 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX-\ntreated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either na\u00efve to or had been withdrawn from \nMTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of \nNSAIDs and or prednisone (\u2264 0.2 mg / kg / day or 10 mg / day maximum). In the OL LI phase all \npatients received 24 mg / m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. \nThe distribution of patients by age and minimum, median and maximum dose received during the \nOL LI phase is presented in table 11. \n \n\nTable 11 \ndistribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI phase \n\nage group number of patients at baseline n (%) Minimum, median and maximum \ndose \n\n4 to 7 years 31 (18.1) 10, 20 and 25 mg \n8 to 12 years 71 (41.5) 20, 25 and 40 mg \n13 to 17 years 69 (40.4) 25, 40 and 40 mg \n\n \nPatients demonstrating a paediatric ACR 30 response at week 16 were eligible to be randomised into \nthe double blind (DB) phase and received either adalimumab 24 mg / m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, \nor placebo every other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria \nwere defined as a worsening of \u2265 30 % from baseline in \u2265 3 of 6 paediatric ACR core criteria, \u2265 2 \nactive joints, and improvement of > 30 % in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria.

Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of \nthe baseline age group 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with \nthe combination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \nconsideration, Halimatoz is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2\u2013< 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active polyarticular \nJIA. The patients received 24 mg / m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During the study, most \nsubjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. \n \nAt week 12 and week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5 % and 90.0 %, respectively, using the \nobserved data approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50 / 70 / 90 at week 12 and week 24 \nwere 90.3 % / 61.3 % / 38.7 % and 83.3 % / 73.3 % / 36.7 %, respectively. Amongst those who \nresponded (paediatric ACR 30) at week 24 (n = 27 out of 30 patients), the paediatric ACR 30 responses \nwere maintained for up to 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout \nthis time period. Overall, 20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in \n46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were randomised \nto receive either 24 mg / m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of 40 mg, or \nplacebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-label (OL) period \nduring which patients received 24 mg / m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of 40 mg every other \nweek subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change \nfrom Baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\njoints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean percent \ndecrease of -62.6 % (median percent change -88.9 %) in patients in the adalimumab group compared to \n-11.6 % (median percent change -50.0 %) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in number of \nactive joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through week 156 for the 26 of 31 \n(84 %) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. Although not statistically \nsignificant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as \nnumber of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), paediatric ACR 50 \nresponse, and paediatric ACR 70 response. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nAdalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week double-\nblind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline score of \ndisease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in all groups) \nwho have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1 %) patients were \ntreated concomitantly with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4 %) patients with \nglucocorticoids. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which patients \nreceived adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks. \nSubjects (n = 215, 54.7 %) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at weeks 12, or 16 or 20 received early \nescape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were subsequently treated \nas non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. \n \nIn the larger AS study I with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the \nsigns and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with adalimumab compared to \nplacebo. Significant response was first observed at week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks \n(table 13). \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nTable 13 \nefficacy responses in placebo-controlled AS study \u2013 study I reduction of \n\nsigns and symptoms \nresponse placebo \n\nN=107 \nadalimumab \n\nN=208 \n\nASASa 20   \nweek 2 16 % 42 %*** \nweek 12 21 % 58 %*** \nweek 24 19 % 51 %*** \n\nASAS 50   \nweek 2 3 % 16 %*** \nweek 12 10 % 38 %*** \nweek 24 11 % 35 %*** \n\nASAS 70   \nweek 2 0 % 7 %** \nweek 12 5 % 23 %*** \nweek 24 8 % 24 %*** \n\n   \nBASDAIb 50   \n\nweek 2 4 % 20 %*** \nweek 12 16 % 45 %*** \nweek 24 15 % 42 %*** \n\n***,** statistically significant at p < 0.001, < 0.01 for all comparisons \nbetween adalimumab and placebo at weeks 2, 12 and 24 \n\na assessments in ankylosing spondylitis  \nb Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index \n\n  \nAdalimumab-treated patients had significantly greater improvement at week 12 which was \nmaintained through week 24 in both the SF36 and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life \nQuestionnaire (ASQoL). \n \nSimilar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled AS study II of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in two randomized, double-blind placebo-\ncontrolled studies in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). Study nr-\naxSpA I evaluated patients with active nr-axSpA. Study nr-axSpA II was a treatment withdrawal \nstudy in active nr-axSpA patients who achieved remission during open-label treatment with \nadalimumab. \n \nStudy nr-axSpA I \n \nIn study nr-axSpA I, adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 185 patients in a \nrandomised, 12 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with active nr-axSpA (mean \nbaseline score of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] \nwas 6.4 for patients treated with adalimumab and 6.5 for those on placebo) who have had an \ninadequate response to or intolerance to \u2265 1 NSAIDs, or a contraindication for NSAIDs. \n \nThirty-three (18 %) patients were treated concomitantly with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, \nand 146 (79 %) patients with NSAIDs at baseline. The double-blind period was followed by an open-\nlabel period during which patients receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nto an additional 144 weeks. Week 12 results showed statistically significant improvement of the signs \nand symptoms of active nr-axSpA in patients treated with adalimumab compared to placebo (table 14). \n\nTable 14 \nefficacy response in placebo-controlled study nr-axSpA I \n\ndouble-blind \n\nresponse at week 12 \n\nplacebo \nN=94 \n\nadalimumab \nN=91 \n\nASASa 40 15 % 36 %*** \nASAS 20 31 % 52 %** \nASAS 5/6 6 % 31 %*** \nASAS partial remission 5 % 16 %* \nBASDAIb 50 15 % 35 %** \nASDASc,d,e -0.3 -1.0*** \nASDAS inactive disease 4 % 24 %*** \nhs-CRPd,f,g -0.3 -4.7*** \nSPARCCh MRI sacroiliac jointsd,i -0.6 -3.2** \nSPARCC MRI spined,j -0.2 -1.8** \n\na assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society \nb Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index \nc ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score  \nd mean change from baseline \ne n=91 placebo and n=87 adalimumab \nf high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (mg/L) \ng n=73 placebo and n=70 adalimumab \nh Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada \ni n=84 placebo and adalimumab \nj n=82 placebo and n=85 adalimumab \n***,**,* statistically significant at p < 0.001, < 0.01, and < 0.05, respectively, for all comparisons \n\nbetween adalimumab and placebo. \n  \nIn the open-label extension, improvement in the signs and symptoms was maintained with \nadalimumab therapy through week 156. \n \nInhibition of inflammation \n \nSignificant improvement of signs of inflammation as measured by hs-CRP and MRI of both \nSacroiliac Joints and the Spine was maintained in adalimumab-treated patients through week 156 \nand week 104, respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the HAQ-S and the SF-36 \nquestionnaires.

Radiographs of hands, wrists, \nand feet were obtained at baseline and week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on \nadalimumab or placebo and at week 48 when all patients were on open-label adalimumab. A modified \nTotal Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS \nused for rheumatoid arthritis), was used. \n \nAdalimumab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with \nplacebo treatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (mean \u00b1 SD) 0.8 \u00b1 2.5 in the \nplacebo group (at week 24) compared with 0.0 \u00b1 1.9; (p < 0.001) in the adalimumab group (at week \n48). \n \nIn subjects treated with adalimumab with no radiographic progression from baseline to week 48 \n(n=102), 84 % continued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. \nAdalimumab-treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function \nas assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at week 24. \nImproved physical function continued during the open label extension up to week 136. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis \n(\u2265 10 % BSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u2265 12 or \u2265 10) who were \ncandidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73 % of patients \nenrolled in Psoriasis Studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety \nand efficacy of adalimumab were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque \npsoriasis with concomitant hand and / or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a \nrandomised double-blind study (Psoriasis Study III). \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, \npatients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at \nleast a PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75 % relative to baseline), entered \nperiod B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained \n\u2265PASI 75 response at week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in period A, were \nre-randomised in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an \nadditional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the \nbaseline Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53 % of subjects \nincluded) to \u201csevere\u201d (41 %) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6 %). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus methotrexate \nand placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter \ndose increases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab \nfollowed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are \nno data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving \nMTX who achieved a \u2265PASI 50 response at week 8 and / or 12 did not receive further dose increases. \nAcross all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score \nranged from \u201cmild\u201d (< 1 %) to \u201cmoderate\u201d (48 %) to \u201csevere\u201d (46 %) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6 %). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open- \nlabel extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 \nresponse from baseline at Week 16 (see tables 17 and 18). \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nTable 17 \nPs study I (REVEAL) \u2013 efficacy results at 16 weeks \n\n placebo N = 398 \nn (%) \n\nadalimumab 40 mg eow \nN = 814 n (%) \n\n\u2265PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \nPASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \nPGA: clear / minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \n\na percent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as centre-\nadjusted rate \nb p<0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo \n\n \n \n\nTable 18 \nPs study II (CHAMPION) efficacy results at 16 weeks \n\n placebo \nN = 53 n (%) \n\nMTX N = 110 \nn (%) \n\nadalimumab 40 mg eow \nN=108 n (%) \n\n\u2265PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6) a, b \nPASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7) c, d \nPGA: \n\nclear/minimal \n6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1) a, b \n\na p<0.001 adalimumab vs. placebo \nb p<0.001 adalimumab vs. methotrexate \nc p<0.01 adalimumab vs. placebo \nd p<0.05 adalimumab vs. methotrexate \n\n \n \nIn Psoriasis Study I, 28 % of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to \nplacebo at week 33 compared to 5 % continuing on adalimumab, p < 0.001, experienced \u201closs of \nadequate response\u201d (PASI score after week 33 and on or before week 52 that resulted in a < PASI 50 \nresponse relative to baseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to week \n33). Of the patients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled \ninto the open-label extension trial, 38 % (25 / 66) and 55 % (36 / 66) regained PASI 75 response after \n12 and 24 weeks of re-treatment, respectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at week 16 and week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy \nfor 52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. PASI 75 \nand PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7 % and 59.0 %, respectively, \nafter an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all \npatients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, \nwere considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients \nwere 69.6 % and 55.7 %, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 \nweeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open- \nlabel extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a \nmedian time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of \nthese patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5 % (218 / 285) of \npatients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d after 16 \nweeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1 % [123 / 178] \nand 88.8 % [95 / 107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal \nperiod, respectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal. \nSignificant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, \nimprovements in the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nsignificant compared to placebo. \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to \n40 mg weekly due to a PASI response below 50 %, 26.4 % (92 / 349) and 37.8 % (132 / 349) of \npatients achieved PASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in \n72 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater \nproportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands \nand/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3 %, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients \nwith moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed \nby open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included \nthe Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of \nFingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see table 19). \nAdalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin \ninvolvement (BSA \u2265 10 % (60 % of patients) and BSA < 10 % and \u2265 5 % (40 % of patients)). \n \n\nTable 19 \n Ps study IV efficacy results at 16, 26 and 52 weeks \n\n endpoint week 16 \nplacebo-controlled \n\nweek 26 \nplacebo-controlled \n\nweek 52 \nopen-label \n\nplacebo \nN = 108 \n\nadalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN = 109 \n\nplacebo \nN = 108 \n\nadalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN = 109 \n\nadalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN = 80 \n\n\u2265 mNAPSI 75 (%) 2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0 \nPGA-F clear / minimal \nand \u2265 2-grade \nimprovement (%) \n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3 \n\npercent change in total \nfingernail NAPSI (%) -7.8 -44.2\n\na -11.5 -56.2a -72.2 \na p < 0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo \n\n \n \nAdalimumab-treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at week 26 compared with \nplacebo in the DLQI. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 \npaediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a PGA \u2265 4 \nor > 20 % BSA involvement or > 10 % BSA involvement with very thick lesions or PASI \u2265 20 or \n\u2265 10 with clinically relevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately \ncontrolled with topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy. \n \nPatients received adalimumab 0.8 mg / kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg / kg eow (up to 20 mg), or \nmethotrexate 0.1\u20130.4 mg / kg weekly (up to 25 mg).

The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III \ndisease with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg \nevery week starting at week 4 to week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the \nstudy. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in period A were re-\nrandomised in period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to \nplacebo in period A were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 and \n40 mg every week starting at week 4 to week 11. 19.3 % of patients had continued baseline oral \nantibiotic therapy during the study. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab \nin period A were re-randomised in period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every \nweek, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had \nbeen randomised to placebo in period A were assigned to receive placebo in period B. \n \nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension \nstudy in which adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab \npopulation was 762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. \n \nClinical Response \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50 % reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric \nRating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 \npoint scale. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nAt week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo \nachieved HiSCR. At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II \nexperienced a clinically relevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see table 21). Patients treated with \nadalimumab had significantly reduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment. \n \n\nTable 21 \nefficacy results at 12 weeks, HS studies I and II \n\n HS study I HS study II \n \n\nplacebo \nadalimumab \n\n40 mg \nweekly \n\n \nplacebo \n\nadalimumab \n40 mg \nweekly \n\nhidradenitis suppurativa \nclinical response (HiSCR)a \n\nN = 154 \n40 (26.0 %) \n\nN = 153 \n64 (41.8 %)* \n\nN = 163 \n45 (27.6 %) \n\nN = 163 \n96 (58.9 %)*** \n\n\u226530% reduction in skin \npainb \n\nN = 109 \n27 (24.8 %) \n\nN = 122 \n34 (27.9 %) \n\nN = 111 \n23 (20.7 %) \n\nN = 105 \n48 (45.7 %)*** \n\n* p < 0.05,  \n*** p < 0.001, adalimumab versus placebo \na among all randomised patients. \nb among patients with baseline HS-related skin pain assessment \u2265 3, based on Numeric Rating Scale 0\u201310; \n\n0 = no skin pain, 10 = skin pain as bad as you can imagine. \n  \n\nTreatment with adalimumab 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of \nabscesses and draining fistulas. Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group \nin the first 12 weeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the adalimumab group \nexperienced worsening of abscesses (23.0 % vs 11.4 %, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0 % \nvs 13.9 %, respectively). \n \nGreater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skin-\nspecific health-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index \n(DLQI; Studies HS-I and HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as \nmeasured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire \u2013 medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and \nHS-II), and physical health as measured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 \n(Study HS-I). \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly at week 12, the HiSCR \nrate at week 36 was higher in patients who continued weekly adalimumab than in patients in \nwhom dosing frequency was reduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn \n(see table 22). \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nTable 22 \nproportion of patientsa achieving HiSCRb at weeks 24 and 36 after \n\ntreatment reassignment from weekly adalimumab at week 12 \n\n placebo \n(treatment \n\nwithdrawal) \nN = 73 \n\nadalimumab \n40 mg every \nother week \n\nN = 70 \n\nadalimumab \n40 mg weekly \n\nN = 70 \n\nweek 24 24 (32.9 %) 36 (51.4 %) 40 (57.1 %) \nweek 36 22 (30.1 %) 28 (40.0 %) 39 (55.7 %) \n\na patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly after\n  12 weeks of treatment. \nb patients meeting protocol-specified criteria for loss of response or no \n\nimprovement were required to discontinue from the studies and were counted as \nnon-responders. \n\n \n \nAmong patients who were at least partial responders at week 12, and who received continuous weekly \nadalimumab therapy, the HiSCR rate at week 48 was 64.3 % and at week 96 was 65.1 %. Longer term \ntreatment with adalimumab 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings.  \n \nAmong patients whose adalimumab treatment was withdrawn at week 12 in Studies HS-I and \nHS-II, the HiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of adalimumab 40 mg weekly returned \nto levels similar to that observed before withdrawal (56.0 %). \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab \nfor the treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and \nexposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, \npathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure levels. \nSafety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on cross-\nindication safety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more \nfrequent doses (see section 5.2). \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1500 patients with moderately to \nseverely active Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 and \u2264 450) in \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of \naminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and / or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80 % of \npatients continued to receive at least one of these medications. \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist na\u00efve patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 \nand 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week \n2. In CD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were \nrandomised to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at Weeks \n0 and 2. The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients \nwere not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD study III, 854 \npatients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were \nrandomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nof 56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u2265 70) at week 4 were stratified and \nanalysed separately from those not in clinical response at week 4. Corticosteroid taper was \npermitted after week 8. \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in table 23. \n \n\nTable 23 \ninduction of clinical remission and response  \n\n(percent of patients) \n CD study I: infliximab-na\u00efve \n\npatients \nCD study II: infliximab-\nexperienced patients \n\n placebo \nN = 74 \n\nadalimumab\n80 / 40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nadalimumab \n160 / 80 mg \n\nN = 76 \n\nplacebo \nN=166 \n\nadalimumab \n160 / 80 mg \n\nN = 159 \n\nweek 4      \nclinical remission 12 % 24 % 36 %* 7 % 21 %* \nclinical response (CR- \n100) \n\n24 % 37 % 49 %** 25 % 38 %** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for adalimumab versus placebo \n* p < 0.001 \n** p < 0.01 \n\n \n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160 / 80 mg and 80 / 40 mg induction regimens by \nweek 8 and adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160 / 80 mg group. \n \nIn CD study III, at week 4, 58 % (499 / 854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed \nin the primary analysis. Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48 % had been previously exposed \nto other TNF-antagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in table 24. \nClinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist \nexposure.

These results suggest that \nsome patients who have not responded by Week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough Week 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses \n(see section 4.2). \n \n117 / 276 patients from CD study I and 272 / 777 patients from CD studies II and III were \nfollowed through at least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, \nrespectively, continued to be in clinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained \nin 102 and 233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn CD study I and CD study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific \ninflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients \nrandomised to adalimumab 80 / 40 mg and 160 / 80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks \n26 and 56 in CD study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo \ngroup. \n \nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nAdalimumab was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on \nbody weight (< 40 kg or \u2265 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and \n17 (inclusive) years, with moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn\u2019s \nDisease Activity Index (PCDAI) score > 30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy \n(including a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously \nlost response or been intolerant to infliximab. \n \nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: \n160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 for subjects \u2265 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for \nsubjects < 40 kg. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nAt week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low \nDose or Standard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in table 25. \n \n\nTable 25 \nmaintenance regimen \n\npatient \nweight \n\nlow dose standard \ndose \n\n< 40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow \n\u2265 40 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow \n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at week 26, defined as PCDAI score \u2264 10. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points \nfrom Baseline) rates are presented in table 26.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0 % (37 / 50) of the 50 patients remaining \nin the study continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0 % (46 / 50) of patients continued to be in \nclinical response per PCDAI. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with \nmoderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to \n3) in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. \n \nIn study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist na\u00efve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at weeks 0 \nand 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 followed by 80 mg at week 2, or 80 mg adalimumab at week 0 \nfollowed by 40 mg at week 2. After week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received 40 mg eow. \nClinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u2264 2 with no subscore > 1) was assessed at week 8. \n \nIn study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of adalimumab at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg \neow thereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for induction of \nremission at week 8 and for maintenance of remission at week 52. \n \nPatients induced with 160 / 80 mg adalimumab achieved clinical remission versus placebo at week 8 \nin statistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18 % vs. 9 % respectively, p = 0.031) \nand study UC-II (17 % vs. 9 % respectively, p = 0.019).

Among patients who had failed prior anti-TNF treatment, week 52 remission was achieved \nby 3 % on placebo and 10 % on adalimumab. \n \nPatients from studies UC-I and UC-II had the option to roll over into an open-label long-term \nextension study (UC III). Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75 % (301 / 402) continued to be \nin clinical remission per partial Mayo score. \n \nHospitalisation rates \n \nDuring 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related \nhospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The \nnumber of all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year vs. \n0.26 per patient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related \nhospitalisations were 0.12 per patient year vs. 0.22 per patient year. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel \nDisease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious \nintermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two \nrandomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or \nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg / day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of \nprednisone 60 mg / day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \ncorticosteroid discontinuation by week 15. \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg / day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently \nunderwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best \ncorrected visual acuity (BCVA). \n \nPatients who completed studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue \non study medication beyond week 78 until they had access to adalimumab.  \n \nClinical Response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (see table 29). Both \nstudies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus \nplacebo (see Figure 2). \n \n\nTable 29  \ntime to treatment failure in studies UV I and UV II \n\nanalysis N failure median time to HRa CI 95 % p Value b \ntreatment  N (%) failure (months)  for HRa  \n\ntime to treatment failure at or after week 6 in study UV I \nprimary analysis (ITT) \n\nplacebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 -- -- -- \nadalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36, 0.70 < 0.001 \n\ntime to treatment failure at or after week 2 in study UV II  \nprimary analysis (ITT) \n\nplacebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 -- -- -- \nadalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39, 0.84 0.004 \n\nNote: treatment failure at or after week 6 (study UV I), or at or after week 2 (study UV II), was \ncounted as event.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences \nwere observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of \nadalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of studies UV I and UV II, \n60 subjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to  complications secondary to \ndiabetic retinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis \nof efficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74 %) reached 78 weeks of open-\nlabel adalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3 %) were in quiescence (no \nactive inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade \u2264 0.5+, VH grade \u2264 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose \u2264 \n7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2 %) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or \nmaintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6 % of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were \ngenerally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. \nOverall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18 % discontinued due to adverse events, and \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n8 % due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of Life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with \nstatistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, \nand total score in study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in study UV II. Vision related \neffects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in study UV I and for colour \nvision, peripheral vision and near vision in study UV II.  \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled \nstudy of 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated non-infectious \nanterior uveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received \neither placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week \nin combination with their baseline dose of methotrexate. \n \nThe primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with \ndevelopment of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted \nuse of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n \nClinical Response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 3, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects \ntreated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects \ntreated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. \nAdalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown \nby the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier curves summarizing time to treatment failure in the paediatric \nuveitis study \n\n \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. \nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy \nof adalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies \nand the occurrence of adverse events. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nthe reference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in ulcerative colitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64 %. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg / kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg / kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from \n11 to 15 ml / hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31\u201396 % of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult \nrheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were \napproximately 5 \u00b5g / ml (without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 \u00b5g / ml (with concomitant \nmethotrexate), respectively. The serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nproportionally with dose following 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and \nevery week. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg / m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean \ntrough steady-state (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was \n5.6 \u00b1 5.6 \u00b5g / ml (102 % CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and \n10.9 \u00b1 5.2 \u00b5g / ml (47.7 % CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg / m2, the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations \nwas 6.0 \u00b1 6.1 \u00b5g / ml (101 % CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and \n7.9 \u00b1 5.6 \u00b5g / ml (71.2 % CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg / m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n(values measured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 \u00b1 6.6 \u03bcg / ml for \nadalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcg / ml with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 \u00b5g / ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg / kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every \nother week to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean \u00b1 SD steady-state \nadalimumab trough concentration was approximately 7.4 \u00b1 5.8 \u00b5g / ml (79 % CV). \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (\u00b1SD) trough steady-state concentration at \nweek 68 was 8.0 \u00b1 4.6 \u00b5g/ml. \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n80 mg on week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 \u03bcg / ml \nat week 2 and week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were \napproximately 8 to 10 \u03bcg / ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since exposure \nto adalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and inadequate \nresponse may benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week.  \n \nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n5.5 \u00b5g / ml during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n80 mg adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n12 \u00b5g / ml during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 \u00b5g / ml \nwere observed in Crohn\u2019s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab \nevery other week. \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160 / 80 mg or 80 / 40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of \n40 kg. At week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40 / 20 mg eow) or Low \nDose (20 / 10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (\u00b1 SD) \nserum adalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7\u00b16.6 \u00b5g/ml for patients \n\u2265 40 kg (160 / 80 mg) and 10.6 \u00b1 6.1 \u00b5g / ml for patients < 40 kg (80 / 40 mg). \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (\u00b1 SD) adalimumab trough \nconcentrations at week 52 were 9.5 \u00b1 5.6 \u00b5g / ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 \u00b1 2.2 \u00b5g / ml for \nthe Low Dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to \nreceive adalimumab treatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose-escalated from eow to weekly \nregimen, the mean (\u00b1 SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at week 52 were 15.3 \u00b1 11.4 \u03bcg / ml \n(40 / 20 mg, weekly) and 6.7 \u00b1 3.5 \u03bcg / ml (20 / 10 mg, weekly). \n \nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 \u00b5g / ml \nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 \u00b5g / ml were observed \nin ulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 \u00b5g/ml. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. The \npredicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an initial \nincrease in systemic exposure. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients \u2265 40 kg with CD). \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 response \n(EC50) was 3 \u03bcg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 \u03bcg/ml). \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab concentrations, \nboth with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 \u03bcg/mL (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and 1.9-10.5, \nrespectively). \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be \nlower in patients with measurable AAA. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity / perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg / kg (9\u201317 monkeys / group) and has revealed no evidence \nof harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard \nassessment of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of \nappropriate models for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the \ndevelopment of neutralising antibodies in rodents. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before your child starts using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- Your doctor will also give you a Patient Reminder Card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before your child begins using Halimatoz and during \ntreatment with Halimatoz. Keep this Patient Reminder Card with you during your treatment and \nfor 4 months after your (or your child\u2019s) last injection of Halimatoz. \n\n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child\u2019s. \n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Halimatoz is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before your child uses Halimatoz \n3. How to use Halimatoz \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Halimatoz \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Instructions for use  \n \n1. What Halimatoz is and what it is used for \n \nHalimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n(defence) system.  \n \nHalimatoz is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\u2022 polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \n\u2022 enthesitis-related arthritis \n\u2022 paediatric plaque psoriasis, \n\u2022 paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, \n\u2022 paediatric non-infectious uveitis.  \n \nThe active ingredient in Halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body.  \n \nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Halimatoz blocks its \naction and reduces the inflammation in these diseases. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood.  \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\nto 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may \nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \nwork well enough, patients will be given Halimatoz to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered \nwith silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become \nthickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a \nproblem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n \nHalimatoz is also used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for \nwhom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or \nare not suitable. \n \nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease  \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to \n17 years.  \n \nYour child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child  \nwill be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of his / her disease. \n \nPaediatric non-infectious uveitis  \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation \nleads to a decrease of vision and / or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that \nmove across the field of vision). Halimatoz works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with \ninflammation affecting the front of the eye. \n \nYour child may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child \nwill be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of his / her disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before your child uses Halimatoz \n \nDo not use Halimatoz \n \n\u2022 if your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n\u2022 if your child has a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other \nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \nimportant that you tell your doctor if your child shows symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n\u2022 if your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if your child \nhas had or has a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Halimatoz. \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nAllergic reaction \n \n\u2022 If your child has allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, do not inject more Halimatoz and contact your doctor immediately, since in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life-threatening. \n\n \nInfection \n \n\u2022 If your child has an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example leg ulcer), \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Halimatoz. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Your child might get infections more easily while he / she is receiving Halimatoz treatment. This \nrisk may increase if your child\u2019s lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious \nand include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other \nunusual infectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning).  \n\n\u2022 In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if your \nchild shows symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may \nrecommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz. \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will \n\ncheck your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Halimatoz. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your child\u2019s medical history and screening tests \n(for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be \nrecorded on your child\u2019s Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if \nyour child has ever had tuberculosis, or if he / she has been in close contact with someone who \nhas had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child has had \npreventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight \nloss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \ndoctor immediately. \n\n \nTravel / recurrent infection \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if your child has lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if your child has a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that \nincrease the risk of infections. \n\n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he / she has active \n\nHBV infection or if you think he / she might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should \ntest your child for HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this \nvirus. In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the \nimmune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedures \n \n\u2022 If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that your child is \n\ntaking Halimatoz. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz. \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\u2022 If your child has or develops demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer \n\naround the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if he / she should receive \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\nor continue to receive Halimatoz. Tell your doctor immediately if he / she experiences symptoms \nlike changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body. \n\n \nVaccine \n \n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and \n\nshould not be given during treatment with Halimatoz in case they cause infections. Check with \nyour doctor before your child receives any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children \nbe given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Halimatoz.  \n\nIf your child receives Halimatoz while she is pregnant, her baby may be at higher risk for getting \nan infection for up to about five months after the last dose she received during pregnancy. It is \nimportant that you tell her baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your child\u2019s \nHalimatoz use during herpregnancy so they can decide when her baby should receive any \nvaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n\u2022 It is important to tell your doctor if your child has had or has a serious heart condition. If he / she \n\nhas mild heart failure and is being treated with Halimatoz, the heart failure status must be closely \nmonitored by your doctor. If your child develops new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections \n\nor help stop bleeding. If your child develops a fever that does not go away, or he / she bruises or \nbleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to \nstop treatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If your child takes Halimatoz, the \nrisk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a \nspecific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of \nthose patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your \ndoctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Halimatoz.  \n\n\u2022 In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\nThere have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung disease \ncalled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF\u03b1 blocker. If your child \nhas COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a \nTNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate. \n\n \nAutoimmune diseases \n \n\u2022 On rare occasions, treatment with Halimatoz could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \n\ndoctor, if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n \n\u2022 Do not give Halimatoz to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of \n\n2 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric plaque psoriasis or paediatric ulcerative colitis \nbelow the age of 4 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease below the age of 6 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Halimatoz \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any \nother medicines. \n \nHalimatoz can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \nagents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), \ncorticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYour child should not take Halimatoz with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or \nabatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other \nTNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk \nfor infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you \nhave questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\u2022 Your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue \n\nits use for at least 5 months after the last Halimatoz treatment. \n\n\u2022 If your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her \ndoctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n\u2022 Halimatoz should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\n\u2022 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did \nnot receive adalimumab. \n\n\u2022 Halimatoz can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n\u2022 If your child  receives Halimatoz during her pregnancy, the baby may have a higher risk for \ngetting an infection.  \n\n\u2022 It is important that you tell her baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about her \nHalimatoz use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information \non vaccines see the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section). \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHalimatoz may have a minor influence on the ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Halimatoz. \n \nHalimatoz contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.4 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\n3.

Instructions for use  \n \n1. What Halimatoz is and what it is used for \n \nHalimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n(defence) system.  \n \nHalimatoz is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\u2022 rheumatoid arthritis, \n\u2022 polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \n\u2022 enthesitis-related arthritis, \n\u2022 ankylosing spondylitis, \n\u2022 axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, \n\u2022 psoriatic arthritis, \n\u2022 psoriasis, \n\u2022 hidradenitis suppurativa, \n\u2022 Crohn\u2019s disease, \n\u2022 ulcerative colitis and \n\u2022 non-infectious uveitis.  \n \nThe active ingredient in Halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body.  \n \nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Halimatoz blocks its \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\naction and reduces the inflammation in these diseases. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \nIf these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to treat your rheumatoid \narthritis. \n \nHalimatoz can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without \nprevious methotrexate treatment. \n \nHalimatoz can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nimprove physical function. \n \nUsually, Halimatoz is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, Halimatoz can be given alone. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood.  \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 \nto 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may \nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \nwork well enough, patients will be given Halimatoz to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n \nHalimatoz is used in adults to treat these conditions. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given \nother medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce \nthe signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered \nwith silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become \nthickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a \nproblem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Halimatoz is also used to treat \nsevere plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines applied to \nthe skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Halimatoz can slow down the damage to the \ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a long-term and often painful inflammatory \nskin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. \nIt most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, \ngroin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. \nHalimatoz can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work \nwell enough, you will be given Halimatoz. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have \nCrohn\u2019s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \nmedicines, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \ngiven other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to \nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation \nleads to a decrease of vision and / or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that \nmove across the field of vision). Halimatoz works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat  \n\u2022 adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye. \n\n\u2022 children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the \nfront of the eye. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Halimatoz \n \nDo not use Halimatoz \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n\u2022 if you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other \nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired, dental problems (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n\u2022 if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Halimatoz. \n \nAllergic reaction \n \n\u2022 If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, do not inject more Halimatoz and contact your doctor immediately, since in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life-threatening. \n\n \nInfection \n \n\u2022 If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example leg ulcer), \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Halimatoz. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n\n\u2022 You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Halimatoz treatment. This risk may \nincrease if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual infectious \norganisms and sepsis (blood poisoning).  \n\n\u2022 In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get \nsymptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend \ntemporarily stopping Halimatoz. \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Halimatoz. This will include a \nthorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example \nchest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on \nyour Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. \nTuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for \ntuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), \nor any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nTravel / recurrent infection \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the \nrisk of infections. \n\n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you \nfor HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare \ncases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation \nof HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nAge over 65 years \n \n\u2022 If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Halimatoz. You \n\nand your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated \nwith Halimatoz. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as \nfever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedures \n \n\u2022 If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking \n\nHalimatoz. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz. \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\u2022 If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \n\nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \nto receive Halimatoz. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \nVaccine \n \n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and \n\nshould not be given during treatment with Halimatoz in case they cause infections. Check with \nyour doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be \ngiven all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Halimatoz.  \n\nIf you receive Halimatoz while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an \ninfection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is \nimportant that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your \nHalimatoz use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any \nvaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n\u2022 It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have \n\nmild heart failure and you are being treated with Halimatoz, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections \n\nor help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed \nvery easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Halimatoz the risk of \ngetting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and \nsevere type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those \npatients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if \nyou are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Halimatoz.  \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n\u2022 In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another \nTNF\u03b1 blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \nAutoimmune diseases \n \n\u2022 On rare occasions, treatment with Halimatoz could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \n\ndoctor, if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\u2022 Do not give Halimatoz to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age \n\nof 2 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric plaque psoriasis or paediatric ulcerative colitis \nbelow the age of 4 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease below the age of 6 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Halimatoz \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nHalimatoz can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \nagents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), \ncorticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYou should not take Halimatoz with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept \ndue to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other TNF-\nantagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you have \nquestions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\u2022 You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use \n\nfor at least 5 months after the last Halimatoz treatment. \n\n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \nfor advice before taking this medicine. \n\n\u2022 Halimatoz should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\n\u2022 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did \nnot receive adalimumab. \n\n\u2022 Halimatoz can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n\u2022 If you receive Halimatoz during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection.  \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \n\n\u2022 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about your \nHalimatoz use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more \ninformation on vaccines see the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section). \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHalimatoz may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Halimatoz. \n \nHalimatoz contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.4 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Halimatoz \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nHalimatoz is available as a 40 mg pen as well as 20 mg and 40 mg pre-filled syringes for patients to \nadminister a full 20 mg or 40 mg dose. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \nAge and body weight How much and how often to \n\ntake? \nNotes \n\nAdults 40 mg every other week as a \nsingle dose \n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, \nmethotrexate is continued \nwhile using Halimatoz.

Instructions for use  \n \n1. What Halimatoz is and what it is used for \n \nHalimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n(defence) system.  \n \nHalimatoz is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\u2022 rheumatoid arthritis, \n\u2022 polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \n\u2022 enthesitis-related arthritis, \n\u2022 ankylosing spondylitis, \n\u2022 axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, \n\u2022 psoriatic arthritis, \n\u2022 psoriasis, \n\u2022 hidradenitis suppurativa, \n\u2022 Crohn\u2019s disease, \n\u2022 ulcerative colitis and \n\u2022 non-infectious uveitis. \n \nThe active ingredient in Halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body.  \n \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Halimatoz blocks its \naction and reduces the inflammation in these diseases. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \nIf these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to treat your rheumatoid \narthritis. \n \nHalimatoz can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without \nprevious methotrexate treatment.  \n \nHalimatoz can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nimprove physical function. \n \nUsually, Halimatoz is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate \nis inappropriate, Halimatoz can be given alone. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood.  \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 \nto 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may \nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \nwork well enough, patients will be given Halimatoz to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n \nHalimatoz is used in adults to treat these conditions. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given \nother medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce \nthe signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered \nwith silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become \nthickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a \nproblem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Halimatoz is also used to \ntreat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines \napplied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Halimatoz can slow down the damage to the \ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a long-term and often painful inflammatory \nskin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. \nIt most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner thighs, \ngroin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. \nHalimatoz can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work \nwell enough, you will be given Halimatoz. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have \nCrohn\u2019s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \nmedicines, you will be given Halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \ngiven other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Halimatoz to \nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation \nleads to a decrease of vision and / or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that \nmove across the field of vision). Halimatoz works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nHalimatoz is used to treat  \n\u2022 adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye.  \n\n\u2022 children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the \nfront of the eye. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Halimatoz \n \nDo not use Halimatoz \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n\u2022 if you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other \nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired, dental problems (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n\u2022 if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Halimatoz. \n \nAllergic reaction \n \n\u2022 If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash, do not inject more Halimatoz and contact your doctor immediately, since in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life-threatening. \n\n \nInfection \n \n\u2022 If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example leg ulcer), \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Halimatoz. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n\n\u2022 You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Halimatoz treatment. This risk may \nincrease if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual infectious \norganisms and sepsis (blood poisoning).  \n\n\u2022 In rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get \nsymptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend \ntemporarily stopping Halimatoz. \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will \n\ncheck you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Halimatoz. This will include a \nthorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example \nchest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on \nyour Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. \nTuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for \ntuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), \nor any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nTravel / recurrent infection \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the \nrisk of infections. \n\n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you \nfor HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare \ncases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation \nof HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \n\n\n\n123 \n\n \n\nAge over 65 years \n \n\u2022 If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Halimatoz. You \n\nand your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated \nwith Halimatoz. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as \nfever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \nSurgery or dental procedures \n \n\u2022 If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking \n\nHalimatoz. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Halimatoz. \n \nDemyelinating disease \n\n \n\u2022 If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \n\nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \nto receive Halimatoz. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your \nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \nVaccine \n \n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and \n\nshould not be given during treatment with Halimatoz in case they cause infections. Check with \nyour doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be \ngiven all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Halimatoz. \n\nIf you receive Halimatoz while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an \ninfection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is \nimportant that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your \nHalimatoz use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any \nvaccine. \n\n \nHeart failure \n \n\u2022 It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have \n\nmild heart failure and you are being treated with Halimatoz, your heart failure status must be \nclosely monitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections \n\nor help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed \nvery easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Halimatoz the risk of \ngetting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and \nsevere type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those \npatients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if \nyou are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Halimatoz.  \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \n\n\u2022 In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another \nTNF\u03b1 blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \nAutoimmune diseases \n \n\u2022 On rare occasions, treatment with Halimatoz could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \n\ndoctor, if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n\u2022 Do not give Halimatoz to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age \n\nof 2 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric plaque psoriasis or paediatric ulcerative colitis \nbelow the age of 4 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not give Halimatoz to children with paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease below the age of 6 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled pen if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Halimatoz \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nHalimatoz can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \nagents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), \ncorticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYou should not take Halimatoz with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept \ndue to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other TNF-\nantagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you have \nquestions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\u2022 You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use \n\nfor at least 5 months after the last Halimatoz treatment. \n\n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \nfor advice before taking this medicine. \n\n\u2022 Halimatoz should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\n\u2022 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did \nnot receive adalimumab. \n\n\u2022 Halimatoz can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n\u2022 If you receive Halimatoz during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection.  \n\n\n\n125 \n\n \n\n\u2022 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about your \nHalimatoz use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more \ninformation on vaccines see the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section). \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHalimatoz may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Halimatoz. \n \nHalimatoz contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.4 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Halimatoz \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nHalimatoz is available as a 40 mg pen as well as 20 mg and 40 mg pre-filled syringes for patients to \nadminister a full 20 mg or 40 mg dose. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \nAge and body weight How much and how often to \n\ntake? \nNotes \n\nAdults 40 mg every other week as a \nsingle dose \n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, \nmethotrexate is continued \nwhile using Halimatoz.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what halimatoz is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "halimatoz contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body's immune (defence) system. halimatoz is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis paediatric plaque psoriasis, paediatric crohn's disease, paediatric non-infectious uveitis. the active ingredient in halimatoz, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. monoclonal antibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target in the body. the target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (tnf\u03b1), which is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. by attaching to tnf\u03b1, halimatoz blocks its action and reduces the inflammation in these diseases. polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of the joints that usually first appear in childhood. halimatoz is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 82 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. patients may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. if these medicines do not work well enough, patients will be given halimatoz to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. paediatric plaque psoriasis plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the body's immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. halimatoz is also used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with uv light have either not worked very well or are not suitable. paediatric crohn's disease crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. halimatoz is used to treat moderate to severe crohn's disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. your child may first be given other medicines. if these medicines do not work well enough, your child will be given halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of his / her disease. paediatric non-infectious uveitis non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. the inflammation leads to a decrease of vision and / or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). halimatoz works by reducing this inflammation. halimatoz is used to treat children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the front of the eye. your child may first be given other medicines. if these medicines do not work well enough, your child will be given halimatoz to reduce the signs and symptoms of his / her disease.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "halimatoz", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},

infectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). in rare cases, these infections may be life-threatening. it is important to tell your doctor if your child shows symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping halimatoz. tuberculosis (tb) as cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting halimatoz. this will include a thorough medical evaluation including your child's medical history and screening tests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). the conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on your child's patient reminder card. it is very important that you tell your doctor if your child has ever had tuberculosis, or if he / she has been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child has had preventative treatment for tuberculosis. if symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. travel / recurrent infection tell your doctor if your child has lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. tell your doctor if your child has a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections. hepatitis b virus tell your doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis b virus (hbv), if he / she has active hbv infection or if you think he / she might be at risk of contracting hbv. your doctor should test your child for hbv. adalimumab can reactivate hbv infection in people who carry this virus. in some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of hbv infection can be life-threatening. surgery or dental procedures if your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that your child is taking halimatoz. your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping halimatoz. demyelinating disease if your child has or develops demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if he / she should receive 84 or continue to receive halimatoz. tell your doctor immediately if he / she experiences symptoms like changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body. vaccine certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and should not be given during treatment with halimatoz in case they cause infections. check with your doctor before your child receives any vaccines. it is recommended that, if possible, children be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with halimatoz. if your child receives halimatoz while she is pregnant, her baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last dose she received during pregnancy. it is important that you tell her baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your child's halimatoz use during herpregnancy so they can decide when her baby should receive any vaccine. heart failure it is important to tell your doctor if your child has had or has a serious heart condition. if he / she has mild heart failure and is being treated with halimatoz, the heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor. if your child develops new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale in some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or help stop bleeding. if your child develops a fever that does not go away, or he / she bruises or bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your doctor right away. your doctor may decide to stop treatment. cancer there have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking adalimumab or other tnf\u03b1 blockers. people with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and leukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). if your child takes halimatoz, the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. on rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. tell your doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with halimatoz. in addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab. if new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks or areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. there have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) treated with another tnf\u03b1 blocker. if your child has copd, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a tnf\u03b1 blocker is appropriate. autoimmune diseases on rare occasions, treatment with halimatoz could result in lupus-like syndrome. contact your doctor, if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. children and adolescents do not give halimatoz to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 years. do not give halimatoz to children with paediatric plaque psoriasis or paediatric ulcerative colitis below the age of 4 years. do not give halimatoz to children with paediatric crohn's disease below the age of 6 years. do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. other medicines and halimatoz tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines. halimatoz can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). your child should not take halimatoz with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. the combination of adalimumab as well as other tnf-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. if you have questions, please ask your doctor. pregnancy and breast-feeding your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least 5 months after the last halimatoz treatment. if your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her doctor for advice before taking this medicine. halimatoz should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. according to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not receive adalimumab. halimatoz can be used during breast-feeding. if your child receives halimatoz during her pregnancy, the baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. it is important that you tell her baby's doctors and other health care professionals about her halimatoz use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information on vaccines see the \"warnings and precautions\" section). driving and using machines halimatoz may have a minor influence on the ability to drive, cycle or use machines. room spinning sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking halimatoz. halimatoz contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.4 ml dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "halimatoz", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 6, "BeginOffset": 11, "EndOffset": 20, "Score": 0.804829478263855,
