NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAtosiban SUN 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial of 0.9 ml solution contains 6.75 mg atosiban (as acetate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \nClear, colourless solution without particles. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAtosiban is indicated to delay imminent pre-term birth in pregnant adult women with: \n- regular uterine contractions of at least 30 seconds duration at a rate of \u2265 4 per 30 minutes \n- a cervical dilation of 1 to 3 cm (0-3 for nulliparas) and effacement of \u2265 50% \n- a gestational age from 24 until 33 completed weeks \n- a normal foetal heart rate \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment with atosiban should be initiated and maintained by a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of pre-term labour. \n \nAtosiban is administered intravenously in three successive stages: an initial bolus dose (6.75 mg), \nperformed with atosiban 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection, immediately followed by a continuous \nhigh dose infusion (loading infusion 300 micrograms/min) of atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for \nsolution for infusion during three hours, followed by a lower dose of atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml \nconcentrate for solution for infusion (subsequent infusion 100 micrograms/min) up to 45 hours. The \nduration of the treatment should not exceed 48 hours. The total dose given during a full course of \natosiban therapy should preferably not exceed 330.75 mg of atosiban. \n \nIntravenous therapy using the initial bolus injection should be started as soon as possible after \ndiagnosis of pre-term labour. Once the bolus has been injected, proceed with the infusion (See \nSummary of Product Characteristics of Atosiban SUN 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for solution for \ninfusion). In the case of persistence of uterine contractions during treatment with atosiban, alternative \ntherapy should be considered. \n \nThe following table shows the full posology of the bolus injection followed by the infusion: \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nStep Regimen Infusion rate Atosiban dose \n1 0.9 ml intravenous bolus Not applicable 6.75 mg \n\n injection given over 1 minute   \n2 3 hours intravenous loading 24 ml/hour (300 \u03bcg/min) 54 mg \n\n infusion   \n3 Up to 45 hours subsequent 8 ml/hour (100 \u03bcg/min) Up to 270 mg \n\n intravenous infusion   \n \nRe-treatment \n \nIn case a re-treatment with atosiban is needed, it should also commence with a bolus injection of \natosiban 6.75 mg/0.9 ml, solution for injection followed by infusion with atosiban 37.5 mg/5 ml, \nconcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nSpecial population \n \nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \nThere is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or \nkidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of \natosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used \nwith caution. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of atosiban in pregnant women aged less than 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntravenous use \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nAtosiban must not be used in the following conditions: \n \n- Gestational age below 24 or over 33 completed weeks \n- Premature rupture of the membranes >30 weeks of gestation \n- Abnormal foetal heart rate \n- Antepartum uterine haemorrhage requiring immediate delivery \n- Eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia requiring delivery \n- Intrauterine foetal death \n- Suspected intrauterine infection \n- Placenta praevia \n- Abruptio placenta \n- Any other conditions of the mother or foetus, in which continuation of pregnancy is hazardous \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhen atosiban is used in patients in whom premature rupture of membranes cannot be excluded, the \nbenefits of delaying delivery should be balanced against the potential risk of chorioamnionitis. \n \nThere is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or \nkidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\natosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used \nwith caution (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nThere is only limited clinical experience in the use of atosiban in multiple pregnancies or the \ngestational age group between 24 and 27 weeks, because of the small number of patients treated. The \nbenefit of atosiban in these subgroups is therefore uncertain. \n \nRe-treatment with atosiban is possible, but there is only limited clinical experience available with \nmultiple re-treatments, up to 3 re-treatments (see section 4.2). \nIn case of intrauterine growth retardation, the decision to continue or reinitiate the administration of \natosiban depends on the assessment of fetal maturity. \n \nMonitoring of uterine contractions and fetal heart rate during administration of atosiban and in case of \npersistent uterine contractions should be considered. \nAs an antagonist of oxytocin, atosiban may theoretically facilitate uterine relaxation and postpartum \nbleeding therefore blood loss after delivery should be monitored. However, inadequate uterus \ncontraction postpartum was not observed during the clinical trials. \n \nMultiple pregnancy and medicinal products with tocolytic activity like calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-mimetics are known to be associated with increased risk of pulmonary oedema. Therefore, \natosiban should be used with caution in case of multiple pregnancy and/or concomitant administration \nof other medicinal products with tocolytic activity (see section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIt is unlikely that atosiban is involved in cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions as in vitro \ninvestigations have shown that atosiban is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 system, and does \nnot inhibit the medicinal product metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nInteraction studies have been performed with labetalol and betamethasone in healthy, female \nvolunteers. No clinically relevant interaction was found between atosiban and bethamethasone or \nlabetalol. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAtosiban should only be used when pre-term labour has been diagnosed between 24 and 33 completed \nweeks of gestation.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIf during pregnancy the woman is already breast-feeding an earlier child, then breast-feeding should \nbe discontinued during treatment with atosiban, since the release of oxytocin during breast-feeding \nmay augment uterine contractility, and may counteract the effect of tocolytic therapy. \n \nIn atosiban clinical trials no effects were observed on breast-feeding. Small amounts of atosiban have \nbeen shown to pass from plasma into the breast milk of breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \n \nEmbryo-fetal toxicity studies have not shown toxic effects of atosiban. No studies were performed that \ncovered fertility and early embryonic development (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nPossible adverse reactions of atosiban were described for the mother during the use of atosiban in \nclinical trials. In total 48% of the patients treated with atosiban experienced adverse reactions during \nthe clinical trials. The observed adverse reactions were generally of a mild severity. The most \ncommonly reported adverse reaction in the mother is nausea (14 %). \n \nFor the newborn, the clinical trials did not reveal any specific adverse reactions of atosiban. The infant \nadverse reactions were in the range of normal variation and were comparable with both placebo and \nbeta-mimetic group incidences. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nMedDRA system organ class \n(SOC) \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare \n\nImmune system disorders    Allergic reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hyperglycaemia   \n\nPsychiatric disorder   Insomnia  \nNervous system disorders  Headache, \n\nDizziness \n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia   \nVascular disorders  Hypotension, Hot \n\nflush \n  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Vomiting   \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Pruritis, Rash  \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorder \n\n   Uterine haemorrhage, \nuterine atony \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n Injection site \nreaction \n\nPyrexia  \n\n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nRespiratory events like dyspnoea and pulmonary oedema, particularly in association with concomitant \nadministration of other medicinal products with tocolytic activity, like calcium antagonists and beta-\nmimetics, and/or in women with multiple pregnancy, have been reported post-marketing. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nFew cases of atosiban overdosing were reported, they occurred without any specific signs or \nsymptoms. There is no known specific treatment in case of an overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other gynecologicals, ATC code: G02CX01 \n \nAtosiban SUN contains atosiban (INN), a synthetic peptide ([Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin) \nwhich is a competitive antagonist of human oxytocin at receptor level. In rats and guinea pigs, \natosiban was shown to bind to oxytocin receptors, to decrease the frequency of contractions and the \ntone of the uterine musculature, resulting in a suppression of uterine contractions. Atosiban was also \nshown to bind to the vasopressin receptor, thus inhibiting the effect of vasopressin. In animals atosiban \ndid not exhibit cardiovascular effects. \n \nIn human pre-term labour, atosiban at the recommended dose antagonises uterine contractions and \ninduces uterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine \ncontractions being significantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence \n(\u2264 4 contractions/hour) for 12 hours. \n \nPhase III clinical trials (CAP-001 studies) include data from 742 women who were diagnosed with \npre-term labour at 23-33 weeks of gestation and were randomised to receive either atosiban (according \nto this labelling) or \u03b2-agonist (dose-titrated). \n \nPrimary endpoint: the primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of women remaining undelivered \nand not requiring alternative tocolysis within 7 days of treatment initiation. The data show that 59.6% \n(n=201) and 47.7% (n=163) of atosiban- and \u03b2-agonist-treated women (p=0.0004), respectively, were \nundelivered and did not require alternative tocolysis within 7 days of starting treatment. Most of the \ntreatment failures in CAP-001 were caused by poor tolerability. Treatment failures caused by \ninsufficient efficacy were significantly (p=0.0003) more frequent in atosiban (n=48, 14.2%) than in the \n\u03b2-agonist-treated women (n=20, 5.8%). \nIn the CAP-001 studies the probability of remaining undelivered and not requiring alternative \ntocolytics within 7 days of treatment initiation was similar for atosiban and beta-mimetics treated \nwomen at gestational age of 24-28 weeks. However, this finding is based on a very small sample \n(n=129 patients). \n \nSecondary endpoints: secondary efficacy parameters included the proportion of women remaining \nundelivered within 48 h of treatment initiation. There was no difference between the atosiban and \nbeta-mimetic groups with regard to this parameter. \n \nMean (SD) gestational age at delivery was the same in the two groups: 35.6 (3.9) and 35.3 (4.2) weeks \nfor the atosiban and \u03b2-agonist groups, respectively (p=0.37). Admission to a neonatal intensive care \nunit (NICU) was similar for both treatment groups (approximately 30%), as was length of stay and \nventilation therapy. Mean (SD) birth weight was 2491 (813) grams in the atosiban group and 2461 \n(831) grams in the \u03b2-agonist group (p=0.58).  \n \nFetal and maternal outcome did apparently not differ between the atosiban and the \u03b2-agonist group, \nbut the clinical trials were not powered enough to rule out a possible difference. \n \nOf the 361 women who received atosiban treatment in the phase III studies, 73 received at least one \nre-treatment, 8 received at least 2 re-treatments and 2 received 3 re-treatments (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \nAs the safety and efficacy of atosiban in women with a gestational age of less than 24 completed \nweeks has not been established in controlled randomised studies, the treatment of this patient group \nwith atosiban is not recommended (see section 4.3). \n \nIn a placebo-controlled study, fetal/infant deaths were 5/295 (1.7%) in the placebo group and 15/288 \n(5.2%) in the atosiban group, of which two occurred at five and eight months of age. Eleven out of the \n15 deaths in the atosiban group occurred in pregnancies with a gestational age of 20 to 24 weeks, \nalthough in this subgroup patient distribution was unequal (19 women on atosiban, 4 on placebo). For \nwomen with a gestational age greater than 24 weeks there was no difference in mortality rate (1.7% in \nthe placebo group and 1.5% in the atosiban group). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy non-pregnant subjects receiving atosiban infusions (10 to 300 micrograms/min over \n12 hours), the steady state plasma concentrations increased proportionally to the dose. \n \nThe clearance, volume of distribution and half-life were found to be independent of the dose. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIn women in pre-term labour receiving atosiban by infusion (300 micrograms/min for 6 to 12 hours), \nsteady state plasma concentrations were reached within one hour following the start of the infusion \n(mean 442 \u00b1 73 ng/ml, range 298 to 533 ng/ml). \n \nFollowing completion of the infusion, plasma concentration rapidly declined with an initial (t\u03b1) and \nterminal (t\u03b2) half-life of 0.21 \u00b1 0.01 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 hours, respectively. Mean value for clearance was \n41.8 \u00b1 8.2 litres/h.  \n \nDistribution \n \nMean value of volume of distribution was 18.3 \u00b1 6.8 litres. \n \nPlasma protein binding of atosiban is 46 to 48% in pregnant women. It is not known whether the free \nfraction in the maternal and fetal compartments differs substantially. Atosiban does not partition into \nred blood cells. \n \nAtosiban passes the placenta. Following an infusion of 300 micrograms/min in healthy pregnant \nwomen at term, the fetal/maternal atosiban concentration ratio was 0.12.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTwo metabolites were identified in the plasma and urine from human subjects. The ratios of the main \nmetabolite M1 (des-(Orn8, Gly-NH2 9) -29)-[Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4]-oxytocin) to atosiban \nconcentrations in plasma were 1.4 and 2.8 at the second hour and at the end of the infusion \nrespectively. It is not known whether M1 accumulates in tissues.  \n \nElimination \n \nAtosiban is found in only small quantities in urine, its urinary concentration is about 50 times lower \nthan that of M1. The proportion of atosiban eliminated in faeces is not known. The main metabolite \nM1 is approximately 10 times less potent than atosiban in inhibiting oxytocin-induced uterine \ncontractions in vitro. Metabolite M1 is excreted in milk (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nPatients with renal or liver impairment \n \nThere is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or \nkidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of \natosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used \nwith caution (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nIt is unlikely that atosiban inhibits hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms in humans (see section 4.5). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo systemic toxic effects were observed during the two-week intravenous toxicity studies (in rats and \ndogs) at doses which are approximately 10 times higher than the human therapeutic dose, and during \nthe three-months toxicity studies in rats and dogs (up to 20 mg/kg/day s.c.). The highest atosiban \nsubcutaneous dose not producing any adverse effects was approximately two times the therapeutic \nhuman dose. \n \nNo studies were performed that covered fertility and early embryonic development. Reproduction \ntoxicity studies, with dosing from implantation up to late stage pregnancy, showed no effects on \nmothers and fetuses. The exposure of the rat fetus was approximately four times that received by the \nhuman fetus during intravenous infusions in women. Animal studies have shown inhibition of \nlactation as expected from the inhibition of action of oxytocin. \n \nAtosiban was neither oncogenic nor mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo tests. \n \n \n6.

The infant \nadverse reactions were in the range of normal variation and were comparable with both placebo and \nbeta-mimetic group incidences. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nMedDRA system organ class \n(SOC) \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare \n\nImmune system disorders    Allergic reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hyperglycaemia   \n\nPsychiatric disorder   Insomnia  \nNervous system disorders  Headache, \n\nDizziness \n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia   \nVascular disorders  Hypotension, Hot \n\nflush \n  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Vomiting   \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Pruritis, Rash  \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorder \n\n   Uterine haemorrhage, \nuterine atony \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n Injection site \nreaction \n\nPyrexia  \n\n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nRespiratory events like dyspnoea and pulmonary oedema, particularly in association with concomitant \nadministration of other medicinal products with tocolytic activity, like calcium antagonists and beta-\nmimetics, and/or in women with multiple pregnancy, have been reported post-marketing. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nFew cases of atosiban overdosing were reported, they occurred without any specific signs or \nsymptoms. There is no known specific treatment in case of an overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other gynecologicals, ATC code: G02CX01 \n \nAtosiban SUN contains atosiban (INN), a synthetic peptide ([Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin) \nwhich is a competitive antagonist of human oxytocin at receptor level. In rats and guinea pigs, \natosiban was shown to bind to oxytocin receptors, to decrease the frequency of contractions and the \ntone of the uterine musculature, resulting in a suppression of uterine contractions. Atosiban was also \nshown to bind to the vasopressin receptor, thus inhibiting the effect of vasopressin. In animals atosiban \ndid not exhibit cardiovascular effects. \n \nIn human pre-term labour, atosiban at the recommended dose antagonises uterine contractions and \ninduces uterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine \ncontractions being significantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence \n(\u2264 4 contractions/hour) for 12 hours. \n \nPhase III clinical trials (CAP-001 studies) include data from 742 women who were diagnosed with \npre-term labour at 23-33 weeks of gestation and were randomised to receive either atosiban (according \nto this labelling) or \u03b2-agonist (dose-titrated). \n \nPrimary endpoint: the primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of women remaining undelivered \nand not requiring alternative tocolysis within 7 days of treatment initiation. The data show that 59.6% \n(n=201) and 47.7% (n=163) of atosiban- and \u03b2-agonist-treated women (p=0.0004), respectively, were \nundelivered and did not require alternative tocolysis within 7 days of starting treatment. Most of the \ntreatment failures in CAP-001 were caused by poor tolerability. Treatment failures caused by \ninsufficient efficacy were significantly (p=0.0003) more frequent in atosiban (n=48, 14.2%) than in the \n\u03b2-agonist-treated women (n=20, 5.8%). \nIn the CAP-001 studies the probability of remaining undelivered and not requiring alternative \ntocolytics within 7 days of treatment initiation was similar for atosiban and beta-mimetics treated \nwomen at gestational age of 24-28 weeks. However, this finding is based on a very small sample \n(n=129 patients). \n \nSecondary endpoints: secondary efficacy parameters included the proportion of women remaining \nundelivered within 48 h of treatment initiation. There was no difference between the atosiban and \nbeta-mimetic groups with regard to this parameter. \n \nMean (SD) gestational age at delivery was the same in the two groups: 35.6 (3.9) and 35.3 (4.2) weeks \nfor the atosiban and \u03b2-agonist groups, respectively (p=0.37). Admission to a neonatal intensive care \nunit (NICU) was similar for both treatment groups (approximately 30%), as was length of stay and \nventilation therapy. Mean (SD) birth weight was 2491 (813) grams in the atosiban group and 2461 \n(831) grams in the \u03b2-agonist group (p=0.58).  \n \nFetal and maternal outcome did apparently not differ between the atosiban and the \u03b2-agonist group, \nbut the clinical trials were not powered enough to rule out a possible difference. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nOf the 361 women who received atosiban treatment in the phase III studies, 73 received at least one \nre-treatment, 8 received at least 2 re-treatments and 2 received 3 re-treatments (see section 4.4). \n \nAs the safety and efficacy of atosiban in women with a gestational age of less than 24 completed \nweeks has not been established in controlled randomised studies, the treatment of this patient group \nwith atosiban is not recommended (see section 4.3). \n \nIn a placebo-controlled study, fetal/infant deaths were 5/295 (1.7%) in the placebo group and 15/288 \n(5.2%) in the atosiban group, of which two occurred at five and eight months of age. Eleven out of the \n15 deaths in the atosiban group occurred in pregnancies with a gestational age of 20 to 24 weeks, \nalthough in this subgroup patient distribution was unequal (19 women on atosiban, 4 on placebo). For \nwomen with a gestational age greater than 24 weeks there was no difference in mortality rate (1.7% in \nthe placebo group and 1.5% in the atosiban group). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn healthy non-pregnant subjects receiving atosiban infusions (10 to 300 micrograms/min over \n12 hours), the steady state plasma concentrations increased proportionally to the dose. \n \nThe clearance, volume of distribution and half-life were found to be independent of the dose. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIn women in pre-term labour receiving atosiban by infusion (300 micrograms/min for 6 to 12 hours), \nsteady state plasma concentrations were reached within one hour following the start of the infusion \n(mean 442 \u00b1 73 ng/ml, range 298 to 533 ng/ml). \n \nFollowing completion of the infusion, plasma concentration rapidly declined with an initial (t\u03b1) and \nterminal (t\u03b2) half-life of 0.21 \u00b1 0.01 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 hours, respectively. Mean value for clearance was \n41.8 \u00b1 8.2 litres/h.  \n \nDistribution \n \nMean value of volume of distribution was 18.3 \u00b1 6.8 litres. \n \nPlasma protein binding of atosiban is 46 to 48% in pregnant women. It is not known whether the free \nfraction in the maternal and fetal compartments differs substantially. Atosiban does not partition into \nred blood cells. \n \nAtosiban passes the placenta. Following an infusion of 300 micrograms/min in healthy pregnant \nwomen at term, the fetal/maternal atosiban concentration ratio was 0.12.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTwo metabolites were identified in the plasma and urine from human subjects. The ratios of the main \nmetabolite M1 (des-(Orn8, Gly-NH2 9) -29)-[Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4]-oxytocin) to atosiban \nconcentrations in plasma were 1.4 and 2.8 at the second hour and at the end of the infusion \nrespectively. It is not known whether M1 accumulates in tissues.  \n \nElimination \n \nAtosiban is found in only small quantities in urine, its urinary concentration is about 50 times lower \nthan that of M1. The proportion of atosiban eliminated in faeces is not known. The main metabolite \nM1 is approximately 10 times less potent than atosiban in inhibiting oxytocin-induced uterine \ncontractions in vitro. Metabolite M1 is excreted in milk (see section 4.6). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \nPatients with renal or liver impairment \n \nThere is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or \nkidneys. Renal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of \natosiban is excreted in the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used \nwith caution (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nIt is unlikely that atosiban inhibits hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms in humans (see section 4.5). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo systemic toxic effects were observed during the two-week intravenous toxicity studies (in rats and \ndogs) at doses which are approximately 10 times higher than the human therapeutic dose, and during \nthe three-months toxicity studies in rats and dogs (up to 20 mg/kg/day s.c.). The highest atosiban \nsubcutaneous dose not producing any adverse effects was approximately two times the therapeutic \nhuman dose. \n \nNo studies were performed that covered fertility and early embryonic development. Reproduction \ntoxicity studies, with dosing from implantation up to late stage pregnancy, showed no effects on \nmothers and fetuses. The exposure of the rat fetus was approximately four times that received by the \nhuman fetus during intravenous infusions in women. Animal studies have shown inhibition of \nlactation as expected from the inhibition of action of oxytocin. \n \nAtosiban was neither oncogenic nor mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo tests. \n \n \n6.

Replace it by 10 ml atosiban \n37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion from two 5 ml vials to obtain a concentration of \n75 mg atosiban in 100 ml. \n \nThe reconstituted medicinal product is a clear, colourless solution without particles. \n \nThe loading infusion is given by infusing 24 ml/hour (i.e. 18 mg/h) of the above prepared solution \nover the 3 hour period under adequate medical supervision in an obstetric unit. After three hours the \ninfusion rate is reduced to 8 ml/hour. \n \nPrepare new 100 ml bags in the same way as described to allow the infusion to be continued. \n \nIf an infusion bag with a different volume is used, a proportional calculation should be made for the \npreparation. \n \nTo achieve accurate dosing, a controlled infusion device is recommended to adjust the rate of flow in \ndrops/min. An intravenous microdrip chamber can provide a convenient range of infusion rates within \nthe recommended dose levels for atosiban. \n \nIf other medicinal products need to be given intravenously at the same time, the intravenous cannula \ncan be shared or another site of intravenous administration can be used. This permits the continued \nindependent control of the rate of infusion. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nAtosiban SUN 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection \natosiban \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, midwife or pharmacist. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Atosiban SUN is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Atosiban SUN \n3. How Atosiban SUN will be given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Atosiban SUN \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Atosiban SUN is and what it is used for \n \nAtosiban SUN contains atosiban. Atosiban SUN is used to delay the premature birth of your baby. \nAtosiban SUN is used in pregnant adult women, from week 24 to week 33 of the pregnancy. \n \nAtosiban SUN works by making the contractions in your womb (uterus) weaker. It also makes the \ncontractions happen less often. It does this by blocking the effect of a natural hormone in your body \ncalled \u201coxytocin\u201d which causes your womb (uterus) to contract. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Atosiban SUN \n \nDo not use Atosiban SUN \n- If you are allergic to atosiban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. \n- If you are more than 33 weeks pregnant. \n- If your waters have broken (premature rupture of your membranes) and you have completed \n\n30 weeks of your pregnancy or more. \n- If your unborn baby (foetus) has an abnormal heart rate. \n- If you have bleeding from your vagina and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be delivered \n\nstraight away. \n- If you have something called \u201csevere pre-eclampsia\u201d and your doctor wants your unborn baby \n\nto be delivered straight away. Severe pre-eclampsia is when you have very high blood pressure, \nfluid retention and/or protein in your urine. \n\n- If you have something called \u201ceclampsia\u201d which is similar to \u201csevere pre-eclampsia\u201d but you \nwould also have fits (convulsions). This will mean your unborn baby needs to be delivered \nstraight away. \n\n- If your unborn baby has died. \n- If you have or could have an infection of your womb (uterus). \n- If your placenta is covering the birth canal. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n- If your placenta is detaching from the wall of your womb. \n- If you or your unborn baby have any other conditions where it would be dangerous to continue \n\nwith your pregnancy. \n \nDo not use Atosiban SUN if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \nmidwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN \n- If you think your waters might have broken (premature rupture of your membranes). \n- If you have kidney or liver problems. \n- If you are between 24 and 27 weeks pregnant. \n- If you are pregnant with more than one baby. \n- If your contractions start again, treatment with Atosiban SUN can be repeated up to three more \n\ntimes. \n- If your unborn baby is small for the time of your pregnancy. \n- Your womb may be less able to contract after your baby has been born. This may cause \n\nbleeding. \n- If you are pregnant with more than one baby and/or are given medicines that can delay the birth \n\nof your baby, such as medicines used for high blood pressure. This may increase the risk of lung \noedema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs). \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist \nbefore you are given Atosiban SUN. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAtosiban SUN has not been studied in pregnant women less than 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Atosiban SUN \nTell your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant and breast-feeding an earlier child, you should stop breast-feeding while you are \ngiven Atosiban SUN. \n \n \n3. How Atosiban SUN will be given \n \nAtosiban SUN will be given to you in a hospital by a doctor, nurse or midwife. They will decide how \nmuch you need. They will also make sure the solution is clear and free from particles. \n \nAtosiban SUN will be given into a vein (intravenously) in three stages: \n- The first injection of 6.75 mg in 0.9 ml will be slowly injected into your vein over one minute. \n- Then a continuous infusion (drip) will be given at a dose of 18 mg per hour for 3 hours. \n- Then another continuous infusion (drip) at a dose of 6 mg per hour will be given for up to \n\n45 hours, or until your contractions have stopped. \nTreatment should last no longer than 48 hours in total. \n \nFurther treatment with Atosiban SUN can be used if your contractions start again.

What you need to know before you are given Atosiban SUN \n3. How Atosiban SUN will be given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Atosiban SUN \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Atosiban SUN is and what it is used for \n \nAtosiban SUN contains atosiban. Atosiban SUN is used to delay the premature birth of your baby. \nAtosiban SUN is used in pregnant adult women, from week 24 to week 33 of the pregnancy. \n \nAtosiban SUN works by making the contractions in your womb (uterus) weaker. It also makes the \ncontractions happen less often. It does this by blocking the effect of a natural hormone in your body \ncalled \u201coxytocin\u201d which causes your womb (uterus) to contract. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Atosiban SUN  \n \nDo not use Atosiban SUN \n- If you are allergic to atosiban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. \n- If you are more than 33 weeks pregnant. \n- If your waters have broken (premature rupture of your membranes) and you have completed \n\n30 weeks of your pregnancy or more. \n- If your unborn baby (foetus) has an abnormal heart rate. \n- If you have bleeding from your vagina and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be delivered \n\nstraight away. \n- If you have something called \u201csevere pre-eclampsia\u201d and your doctor wants your unborn baby \n\nto be delivered straight away. Severe pre-eclampsia is when you have very high blood pressure, \nfluid retention and/or protein in your urine. \n\n- If you have something called \u201ceclampsia\u201d which is similar to \u201csevere pre-eclampsia\u201d but you \nwould also have fits (convulsions). This will mean your unborn baby needs to be delivered \nstraight away. \n\n- If your unborn baby has died. \n- If you have or could have an infection of your womb (uterus). \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n- If your placenta is covering the birth canal. \n- If your placenta is detaching from the wall of your womb. \n- If you or your unborn baby have any other conditions where it would be dangerous to continue \n\nwith your pregnancy. \n \nDo not use Atosiban SUN if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \nmidwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you are given Atosiban SUN \n- If you think your waters might have broken (premature rupture of your membranes). \n- If you have kidney or liver problems. \n- If you are between 24 and 27 weeks pregnant. \n- If you are pregnant with more than one baby. \n- If your contractions start again, treatment with Atosiban SUN can be repeated up to three more \n\ntimes. \n- If your unborn baby is small for the time of your pregnancy. \n- Your womb may be less able to contract after your baby has been born. This may cause \n\nbleeding. \n- If you are pregnant with more than one baby and/or are given medicines that can delay the birth \n\nof your baby, such as medicines used for high blood pressure. This may increase the risk of lung \noedema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs). \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist \nbefore you are given Atosiban SUN. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAtosiban SUN has not been studied in pregnant women less than 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Atosiban SUN \nTell your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant and breast-feeding an earlier child, you should stop breast-feeding while you are \ngiven Atosiban SUN. \n \n \n3. How Atosiban SUN will be given \n \nAtosiban SUN will be given to you in a hospital by a doctor, nurse or midwife. They will decide how \nmuch you need. They will also make sure the solution is clear and free from particles. \n \nAtosiban SUN will be given into a vein (intravenously) in three stages: \n- The first injection of 6.75 mg in 0.9 ml will be slowly injected into your vein over one minute. \n- Then a continuous infusion (drip) will be given at a dose of 18 mg per hour for 3 hours. \n- Then another continuous infusion (drip) at a dose of 6 mg per hour will be given for up to \n\n45 hours, or until your contractions have stopped. \nTreatment should last no longer than 48 hours in total. \n \nFurther treatment with Atosiban SUN can be used if your contractions start again. Treatment with \nAtosiban SUN can be repeated up to three more times. \n \nDuring treatment with Atosiban SUN, your contractions and your unborn baby\u2019s heart rate may be \nmonitored. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n \nIt is recommended that no more than three re-treatments should be used during a pregnancy. \n \n \n4.
