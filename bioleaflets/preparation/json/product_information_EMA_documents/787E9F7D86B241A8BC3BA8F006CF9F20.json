NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCarmustine Obvius 100 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial of powder for concentrate for solution for infusion contains 100 mg carmustine. \n\n \nAfter reconstitution and dilution (se section 6.6), one mL of solution contains 3.3 mg carmustine. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach ampoule of solvent contains 3 ml ethanol anhydrous (that is equivalent to 2.37 g). \n\n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n\n \nPowder: white to almost white powder or lyophilisate.  \n\n \nSolvent: colourless clear liquid. \n\n \nThe pH and osmolarity of ready-to-use solutions for infusion are: \npH 4.0 to 5.0 and 385-397mOsm/l (if diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml [5%] solution for injection), and  \npH 4.0 to 6.8 and 370-378mOsm/l (if diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml [0.9%] solution for \ninjection). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCarmustine is effective in the following malignant neoplasms as a single agent or in combination with \nother antineoplastic agents and/or other therapeutic measures (radiotherapy, surgery): \n \n\n- Brain tumours (glioblastoma, Brain-stem gliomas, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma and \nependymoma), brain metastases \n \n\n- Secondary therapy in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease \n \n\n- as conditioning treatment prior to autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation \n(HPCT) in malignant haematological diseases (Hodgkin’s disease / Non-hodgkin’s \nlymphoma). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCarmustine Obvius must be administered only by specialists experienced in the field of chemotherapy \nand under appropriate medical supervision \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nInitial doses \nThe recommended dose of Carmustine Obvius as a single agent in previously untreated patients is \n150 to 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 6 weeks. This may be given as a single dose or divided into \ndaily infusions such as 75 to 100 mg/m2 on two successive days. \n\n \nWhen Carmustine Obvius is used in combination with other myelosuppressive medicinal products or \nin patients in whom bone marrow reserve is depleted, the doses should be adjusted according to the \nhaematologic profile of the patient as shown below. \n\n \nMonitoring and subsequent doses \nA repeat course of Carmustine Obvius should not be given until circulating blood elements have \nreturned to acceptable levels (platelets above 100,000/mm3, leukocytes above 4,000/mm3), and this is \nusually in six weeks. Blood counts should be monitored frequently and repeat courses should not be \ngiven before six weeks because of delayed haematologic toxicity. \n\n \nDoses subsequent to the initial dose should be adjusted according to the haematologic response of the \npatient to the preceding dose, in both monotherapy as well as in combination therapy with other \nmyelosuppressive medicinal products. The following schedule is suggested as a guide to dosage \nadjustment: \n \nTable 1 \n\nNadir after prior dose Percentage of prior dose \nto be given Leucocytes/mm3 Platelets/mm3 \n\n>4,000 >100,000 100% \n3,000 – 3,999 75,000 - 99,999 100% \n2,000 – 2,999 25,000 - 74,999 70% \n<2,000 <25,000 50% \n\n \nIn cases where the nadir after initial dose does not fall in the same row for leucocytes and platelets \n(e.g. leucocytes >4,000 and platelets <25,000) the value given the lowest percentage of prior dose \nshould be used (e.g. platelets <25,000 then a maximum of 50% of prior dose should be given). \n\n \nThere are no limits for the period of application of carmustine therapy. In case the tumor remains \nincurable or some serious or intolerable adverse reactions appear, the carmustine therapy must be \nterminated. \n \nConditioning treatment prior to HPCT \n \nCarmustine is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in patients with malignant \nhaematological diseases before HPCT at a dose of 300 - 600 mg/m2 intravenously. \n \nSpecial populations \n\n \nPaediatric population \nCarmustine is contraindicated in children and adolescents aged <18 years (see section 4.3) \n \nElderly \nIn general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of \nthe dose range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and \ntake into consideration concomitant disease or therapy with other medicinal products. Because elderly \npatients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and \nthe glomerular filtration rate should be monitored and the dose reduced according to this.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRenal impairment \nFor patients with renal impairment the dose of Carmustine Obvius should be reduced if the glomerular \nfiltration rate is reduced. \n \nMethod of administration \nCarmustine Obvius is for intravenous use after reconstitution and further dilution. \n \nBy reconstituting the powder with the solvent provided, a solution has to be prepared by adding \nadditional 27 ml water for injections. Reconstitution and dilution, as recommended, results in a clear, \ncolourless to light yellow stock solution which has to be further diluted with 500 ml sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection. \n\n \nThe resulting ready-to-use solution for infusion should then be administered immediately by \nintravenous drip over a one- to two-hour period protected from light. The duration of infusion should \nnot be less than one hour, otherwise it leads to burning and pain in the injected area. The injected area \nshould be monitored during the administration.  \n\n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other nitrosoureas or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \nSevere bone marrow depression. \nSevere (end-stage) renal impairment. \nChildren and adolescents  \nBreast-feeding. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPulmonary toxicity characterised by pulmonary infiltrates and/or fibrosis has been reported to occur \nwith a frequency ranging up to 30%. This may occur within 3 years of therapy and appears to be dose \nrelated with cumulative doses of 1,200-1,500 mg/m2 being associated with increased likelihood of lung \nfibrosis. Risk factors include smoking, the presence of a respiratory condition, pre-existing \nradiographic abnormalities, sequential or concomitant thoracic irradiation and association with other \nagents that cause lung damage. Baseline pulmonary function studies and chest X-ray should be \nconducted along with frequent pulmonary function tests during treatment. Patients with a baseline \nbelow 70% of the predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity \n(DLCO) are particularly at risk. \n \nAn increased risk for pulmonary toxicities upon treatment with conditioning regimes and HPCT for \nfemales has been reported. So far, this increased risk is described for the treatment itself including \nconditioning regimes without carmustine (e.g. TBI or busulfan-cyclophosphamide) or with carmustine \n(BEAM: carmustine, etopside, cytarabine and melphalan or CBV: cyclophosphamide, carmustine and \netoposide). \n \nHigh-dose therapy with carmustine (especially with 600 mg/m2) prior to haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplantation has been shown to increase the risk for incidence and severity of pulmonary toxicities. \nTherefore, in patients with other risks for pulmonary toxicities, use of carmustine needs to be weighed \nagainst the risks.  \n \nUpon high-dose therapy with carmustine, the risk and severity for infections, cardiac, hepatic, \ngastrointestinal, and renal toxicity, diseases of the nervous system and electrolyte abnormalities \n(hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia) rises. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPatients with comorbidities and worse disease status have a higher risk for adverse events. This needs \nto be respected especially for elderly patients. \n \nHepatic and renal function should also be checked prior to treatment and regularly monitored during \ntherapy (see section 4.8). \n \nNeutropenic enterocolitis can occur as therapy-related adverse event upon treatment with \nchemotherapeutic agents. \n \nCarmustine is carcinogenic in rats and mice at doses less than the recommended human dose based on \nbody surface area (see section 5.3). \n \nBone marrow toxicity is a common and severe toxic adverse reaction of carmustine. Complete blood \ncount should be monitored frequently for at least six weeks after a dose. In case of a decreased number \nof circulating platelets, leucocytes or erythrocytes either from previous chemotherapy or other cause \nthe dose should be adjusted, see Table 1, section 4.2. Liver, kidney and lung function should be \nchecked and monitored regularly during therapy (see section 4.8). Repeat doses of Carmustine Obvius \nshould not be given more frequently than every six weeks. The bone marrow toxicity of carmustine is \ncumulative and therefore the dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts \nfrom prior doses (see section 4.2).  \n \nDirect administration of carmustine into the carotid artery is regarded as experimental and has been \nassociated with ocular toxicity. \n \nA dose of 600 mg/mg2 of this medicine administered to an adult weighing 70 kg would result in \nexposure to 370 mg/kg of ethanol which may cause a rise in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of \nabout 61.7 mg/100 ml. For comparison, for an adult drinking a glass of wine or 500 ml of beer, the \nBAC is likely to be about 50 mg/100 ml. Co-administration with medicines containing e.g. propylene \nglycol or ethanol may lead to accumulation of ethanol and induce adverse effects. Because this \nmedicine is usually given slowly over 6 hours, the effects of alcohol may be reduced. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPhenytoin and dexamethasone \nIn combination with chemotherapeutic medicinal products reduced activity of antiepileptic medicinal \nproducts must be anticipated.  \n \nCimetidine \nConcomitant use with cimetidine leads to delayed, major, suspected, increased carmustine toxic effect \n(due to the inhibition of carmustine metabolism).  \n \nDigoxin \nConcomitant use with digoxin leads to delayed, moderate, suspected, decreased effect of digoxin (due \nto the decreased digoxin absorption).  \n \nMelphalan \nConcomitant use with melphalan leads to increased risk of pulmonary toxicity. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \nWomen should use effective contraception to avoid becoming pregnant while on treatment and for at \nleast 6 months after treatment.  \n \nMale patients should be advised to use adequate contraceptive measures while on treatment with \ncarmustine and for at least 6 months after treatment. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPregnancy \nCarmustine should not be administered to patients who are pregnant. Safe use in pregnancy has not \nbeen established and therefore the benefit must be carefully weighed against the risk of toxicity. \nCarmustine is embryotoxic in rats and rabbits and teratogenic in rats when given in doses equivalent to \nthe human dose (see section 5.3). If Carmustine Obvius is used during pregnancy, or if the patient \nbecomes pregnant while taking (receiving) Carmustine Obvius, the patient should be apprised of the \npotential hazard to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether carmustine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. Carmustine Obvius is contraindicated during breast-feeding and \nup to seven days post-treatment (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nCarmustine may impair male fertility. Males should be advised of potential risk of infertility and to \nseek fertility/family planning counselling prior to therapy with carmustine . \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCarmustine Obvius has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \nthe possibility will have to be taken into consideration, that the alcohol quantity in these \npharmaceutical medicines can impair the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe table includes adverse reactions that were presented during treatment with this medicinal product \nbut may not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. Because clinical trials \nare conducted under very specific conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed may not reflect the \nrates observed in clinical practice. Adverse reactions are generally included if they were reported in \nmore than 1% of patients in the product monograph or pivotal trials, and/or determined to be clinically \nimportant. When placebo-controlled trials are available, adverse reactions are included if the incidence \nis ≥ 5% higher in the treatment group. \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following table includes adverse reactions of carmustine listed by MedDRA system organ class \nand frequency convention presented in order of decreasing seriousness: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: \n \nMedDRA system organ \nclass \n\nFrequency Adverse reactions \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and unspecified \n(including cysts and polyps) \n\nCommon Acute leukaemia, bone marrow \ndysplasia - following long-term use. \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nMyelosuppression. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCommon Anaemia. \n\nNervous system disorders Very \ncommon \n\nAtaxia, dizziness, headache. \n\nCommon Encephalopathy (high-dose therapy and \ndose-limiting). \n\nNot known Muscular pain, status epilepticus, seizure, \ngrand mal seizure. \n\nEye disorders Very \ncommon \n\nOcular toxicities, transient conjunctival \nflushing and blurred vision due to retinal \nhaemorrhages. \n\nCardiac disorders Very common Hypotension, due to the alcohol content of the \nsolvent (high-dose therapy). \n\nNot known Tachycardia \n\nVascular disorders Very \ncommon \n\nPhlebitis. \n\nRare Veno-occlusive disease (high-dose \ntherapy). \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nPulmonary toxicity, interstitial fibrosis \n(with prolonged therapy and cumulative \ndose)* \nPneumonitis. \n\nRare Interstitial fibrosis (with lower doses). \nGastrointestinal disorders Very \n\ncommon \n \n\nEmetogenic potential. \nNausea and vomiting - severe \n\nCommon Anorexia, constipation, diarrhoea, \nstomatitis. \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common Hepatotoxicity, reversible, delayed up to \n60 days after administration (high-dose \ntherapy and dose-limiting), manifested by: \n\n- bilirubin, reversible increase \n- alkaline phosphatase, reversible \n\nincrease \n- SGOT, reversible increase. \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n \nVery \ncommon \n\n \nDermatitis with topical use improves with \nreduced concentration of compounded \nproduct, hyperpigmentation, transient, with \naccidental skin contact. \n\nCommon Alopecia, flushing (due to alcohol content of \nsolvent; increased with administration times \n<1-2 h), injection site reaction. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nNot known Extravasation hazard: vesicant \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\nRare Renal toxicity.  \n \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders \n\nRare Gynecomastia. \n\nNot known Infertility, teratogenesis. \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nNot known Electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, \nhypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia) \n\n* An increased risk for pulmonary toxicities upon treatment with conditioning regimes and HPCT for \nfemales has been reported. So far, this increased risk is described for the treatment itself including \nconditioning regimes without carmustine (e.g. TBI or busulfan-cyclophosphamide) or with carmustine \n(BEAM: carmustine, etopside, cytarabine and melphalan or CBV: cyclophosphamide, carmustine and \netoposide). \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMyelosuppression \nMyelosuppression is very common and begins 7-14 days of administration with recovery 42-56 days \nof administration. The myelosuppression is dose and cumulative dose related, and often biphasic. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders  \nPulmonary fibrosis (with fatal outcome), pulmonary infiltration  \nPulmonary toxicity has been observed in up to 30% of patients. In cases where pulmonary toxicity \nstarted early (within 3 years of treatment), pulmonary infiltrates and/or pulmonary fibrosis occurred, \nsome of which were fatal. The patients were between 22 months and 72 years old. Risk factors include \nsmoking, respiratory disease, existing radiographic abnormalities, sequential or concomitant thoracic \nradiation, as well as combination with other active substances that can cause lung damage. The \nincidence of adverse reactions is probably dose-related; cumulative doses of 1200-1500 mg/m2 have \nbeen associated with an increased likelihood of pulmonary fibrosis. During treatment, lung function \ntests (FVC, DLCO) should be performed regularly. Patients showing a baseline value of <70% of \nexpected forced vital capacity or carbon monoxide diffusion capacity in these tests are at particular \nrisk.  \nIn patients having received carmustine in childhood or adolescence, cases of extremely delayed-onset \npulmonary fibrosis (up to 17 years after treatment) have been described.  \nLong-term follow-up observation of 17 patients who survived brain tumours in childhood showed that \n8 of them succumbed to pulmonary fibrosis. Two of these 8 fatalities occurred within the first 3 years \nof treatment and 6 of them occurred 8-13 years after treatment. The median age of patients who died \non treatment was 2.5 years (1-12 years), the median age of long-term survivors on treatment was 10 \nyears (5-16 years). All patients younger than 5 years of age at the time of treatment died from \npulmonary fibrosis; neither the carmustine dose nor an additional vincristine dose or spinal radiation \nhad any influence on the fatal outcome.  \nAll remaining survivors available for follow-up were diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. Use of \ncarmustine in children and adolescents < 18 years is contraindicated, see section 4.3. \n\n \nPulmonary toxicity also manifested in the post-marketing phase as pneumonitis and interstitial lung \ndisease. Pneumonitis is seen for doses >450 mg/m2 and interstitial lung disease is seen with prolonged \ntherapy and cumulative dose > 1,400 mg/m2. \n \nEmetogenic potential  \nThe emetogenic potential is high at doses >250 mg/m2 and high to moderate in doses ≤250 mg/m2. \nNausea and vomiting are severe and begins within 2-4 h of administration and lasts for 4-6 h. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nRenal toxicity \nRenal toxicity is rare, but occurs for cumulative doses < 1,000 mg/m2. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe main symptom of intoxication is myelosuppression. In addition, the following serious adverse \nreactions may occur: liver necrosis, interstitial pneumonitis, encephalomyelitis. A specialized antidote \nis not available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, alkylating agents, nitrosoureas,  \nATC code: L01AD01 \n \nMechanism of action \nCarmustine is a cell-cycle phase nonspecific antineoplastic agent of the nitrosourea type, which exerts \ntumor cytotoxicity via multiple mechanisms. As an alkylating agent, it can alkylate reactive sites on \nnucleoproteins, thus interfering with DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA repair. It is able to form \ninterstrand crosslinks in DNA, which prevents DNA replication and transcription. In addition, \ncarmustine is known to carbamoylate lysine residues on proteins causing irreversible inactivation of \nenzymes including glutathione reductase. The carbamoylating activity of carmustine is generally \nconsidered less significant than the alkylating activity in its action on tumors, but carbamoylation may \nserve to inhibit DNA repair. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe antineoplastic and toxic activities of carmustine may be due to its metabolites. Carmustine and \nrelated nitrosoureas are unstable in aqueous solutions and degrade spontaneously to reactive \nintermediates that are capable of alkylation and carbamoylation. The alkylating intermediates are \nbelieved to be responsible for the antitumor effect of carmustine. However, opinion is divided over the \nrole of the carbamoylating intermediates as mediators of the biological effects of the nitrosoureas. On \none hand, their carbamoylating activity was reported to contribute to the cytotoxic properties of their \nparent drugs by inhibiting DNA repair enzymes. On the other hand, it has been speculated that the \ncarbamoylating species may mediate some of toxic effects of carmustine.  \n \nCarmustine crosses the blood-brain barrier readily because of its lipophilic nature. \n \nPaediatric population \nCarmustine Obvius should not be used in children and adolescents due to high risk of pulmonary \ntoxicity. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \nIntravenously administered carmustine is rapidly degraded, with no substance intact detectable after \n15 minutes. Because of the good lipid solubility and the lack of ionisation at the physiological pH, \ncarmustine is very well transferred through the blood-brain barrier. Levels of radioactivity in the \ncerebrospinal fluid are at least 50% higher than those measured concurrently in plasma. The kinetic of \ncarmustine in humans is characterised by a two-chamber model. After the intravenous infusion over \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n1 hour, the carmustine-plasma level drops in a biphasic manner. The half-life α is 1-4 minutes and the \nhalf-life β is 18-69 minutes. \n \nBiotransformation \nIt is presumed that the metabolites of carmustine cause its antineoplastic and toxic activity. \n \nElimination \nApproximately 60-70% of a total dose is excreted in the urine in 96 hours and about 10% as \nrespiratory CO2. The fate of the remainder is undetermined. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarmustine was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and embryotoxic in rabbits at dose levels \nequivalent to the human dose. Carmustine affected the fertility of male rats at doses higher than the \nhuman dose. Carmustine, at clinically relevant dose levels, was carcinogenic in rats and mice. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nPowder  \nNo excipients. \n \nSolvent \nEthanol, anhydrous. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThe intravenous solution is unstable in polyvinyl chloride containers. All plastic coming into contact \nwith the carmustine solution for infusion (e.g. infusion set, etc.) should be PVC-free polyethylene \nplastic, otherwise glass ware should be used. \n\n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n3 years. \n \nAfter reconstitution and dilution \nThe solution should be administered within 3 hours after reconstitution and dilution of the product. \nThe solution should be protected from light until end of administration. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore and transport refrigerated (2°C – 8°C). \n \nKeep the vial and ampoule in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution and further dilution of the medicinal product, see section \n6.3. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nPowder \nBrown type I hydrolytic glass vial (50 ml) with light grey 20 mm bromobutyl rubber stopper and \nsealed with a dark red aluminium flip-off cap. \n \nSolvent \nClear type I glass ampoule (5 ml). \n \nOne pack contains one vial with 100 mg of powder for concentrate for solution for infusion and one \nampoule with 3 ml of solvent. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe carmustine powder for concentrate for solution for infusion contains no preservative and is not \nintended as a multiple dose vial. Reconstitution and further dilutions should be carried out under \naseptic conditions. \n \nThe dry frozen product does not contain any preservatives and is suitable only for one use. The \nlyophilisate can appear as a fine powder, however handling can cause it to appear as a more heavy and \nlumpy lyophilisate than as a powdery lyophilisate due to the mechanical instability of the freeze \ndrying cake. The presence of an oily film can be an indication of melting of the medicinal product. \nSuch products are not accepted for use due to the risk of temperature excursions to more than \n30°C.This medicinal product should not be used any further. When you are not clear about the fact \nwhether the product is adequately cooled, then you should immediately inspect each and every vial in \nthe carton. For verification, hold the vial in bright light. \n \nReconstitution and dilution of the powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nDissolve the Carmustine (100 mg powder) with 3 ml of the supplied sterile refrigerated ethanol \nsolvent in the primary packaging (brown glass vial). Carmustine must be completely dissolved in ethanol \nbefore sterile water for injections is added. \nThen aseptically add 27 ml of sterile water for injection to the alcohol solution. The 30 ml stock \nsolution needs to be mixed thoroughly. Reconstitution, as recommended, results in a clear, colourless \nto light yellow stock solution. \n \nThe 30 ml stock solution is to be diluted immediately by adding the 30 ml stock solution to either 500 \nml 5% glucose or 500 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection in glass containers. \nThe 530 ml diluted solution (i.e. the ready-to-use solution) should be mixed for at least 10 seconds \nbefore administration. The Ready-to-Use solution should be administered over 1-2 hours and \nadministration should be finalised within 3 hours from reconstitution of the product.  \n \nAdministration of the infusion should be performed using a PVC free PE infusion set. \nDuring administration of the medicinal product, the container shall be of suitable glass ware. Further, \nthe ready-to-use solution solution needs to be protected from light (e.g. using alu-foil wrapped around \nthe container of the ready-to-use solution) and preferably kept at temperatures below 20-22°C as \nCarmustine degrades faster at higher temperatures. \n \nInfusion of Carmustine Obvius in less than one hour may produce intense pain and burning at the site \nof injection (see section 4.2). \n \nGuidelines for the safe handling and disposal of antineoplastic agents must be observed. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements \n \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n7.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Carmustine Obvius is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before Carmustine Obvius is given to you  \n3. How to use Carmustine Obvius  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Carmustine Obvius  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Carmustine Obvius is and what it is used for \n \nCarmustine Obvius is a medicine which contains carmustine. Carmustine belongs to a group of \nanticancer medicines known as nitrosourea that act by slowing the growth of cancer cells. \n\n \nCarmustine is effective in the following malignant neoplasms as a single agent or in combination with \nother antineoplastic agents and/or other therapeutic measures (radiotherapy, surgery): \n \n- Brain tumours (glioblastoma, Brain-stem gliomas, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma and \n\nependymoma), brain metastases \n- Secondary therapy in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease \n- as conditioning treatment prior to autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation \n\n(HPCT) in malignant haematological diseases (Hodgkin’s disease / Non-hodgkin’s lymphoma). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Carmustine Obvius  \n \nDo not use Carmustine Obvius: \n- if you are allergic to carmustine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n- if you suffer from suppression of blood cell formation in the bone marrow and the number of \n\nyour platelets, white blood cells (leucocytes), or red blood cells (erythrocytes) is therefore \nreduced, either as a result of chemotherapy or other causes. \n\n- if you suffer from higher-grade kidney dysfunction. \n- in children and adolescents \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Carmustine Obvius. \n \nThe major side effect of this medicine is delayed bone marrow suppression, which may show as \ntiredness, bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes as well as infections and fever due to \nchanges in the blood. Therefore your doctor will monitor blood counts weekly for at least 6 weeks \n\n\n\n25 \n\nafter a dose. At the recommended dosage, courses of Carmustine Obvius would not be given more \nfrequently than every 6 weeks. The dosage will be confirmed with the blood count. \n \nBefore treatment, your liver, lung and kidney function will be tested and observed regularly during \ntreatment.  \n \nSince the use of Carmustine Obvius can lead to lung damage, an X-ray of the chest region and lung \nfunction tests will be conducted before treatment is started (please also see the section “Possible side \neffects”). \n \nHigh-dose treatment with Carmustine Obvius (up to 600 mg/m2) is only performed in combination \nwith subsequent stem cell transplanation. Such a higher dose can increase frequency or severity of \nlung, kidney, liver, heart, and gastrointestinal toxicities as well as infections and disturbances in the \nelectrolyte balance (low blood levels of potassium, magnesium, phosphate). \n \nStomach pain (neutropenic enterocolitis) can occur as therapy-related adverse event upon treatment \nwith chemotherapeutic agents. \n \nYour doctor will talk to you about the possibility of lung damage and allergic reactions and their \nsymptoms. If such symptoms occur, you should contact your doctor immediately (see section 4). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nCarmustine Obvius must not be used in children and adolescents aged <18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Carmustine Obvius \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without prescription, such as: \n- Phenytoin, used in epilepsy \n- Dexamethasone, used as an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agent \n- Cimetidine, used for stomach problems like indigestion \n- Digoxin, used if you have abnormal heart rhythm \n- Melphalan, an anticancer medicine \n \nCarmustine Obvius with alcohol \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicine may alter the effects of other medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy and fertility \nCarmustine Obvius should not be used during pregnancy because it may harm your unborn baby. \nTherefore this medicine should not normally be administered to pregnant women. If used during \npregancy, the patient must be aware of the potential risk to the unborn baby. Women of childbearing \npotential are advised to use effective contraception to avoid becoming pregnant whilst being treated \nwith this medicine and for at least 6 months after treatment. \n \nMale patients should use adequate contraceptive measures while on treatment with Carmustine Obvius \nand for at least 6 months after treatment to prevent their partners becoming pregnant. \n \nBreast-feeding \nYou must not breast-feed while taking this medicine and up to 7 days after treatment. A risk to the \nnewborn/infant cannot be excluded. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nDriving and using machines \nCarmustine Obvius has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. You must \ncheck with your doctor before driving or operating any tools or machines because the amount of \nalcohol in this medicine may impair your ability to drive or use machines.  \n \nCarmustine Obvius contains ethanol (alcohol) \nThis medicine contains 2.4 g of alcohol (ethanol) per vial, which isequivalent to 25.92 g per maximal \ndose (10vol%).

How to use Carmustine Obvius \n \nCarmustine Obvius will always be given to you by a healthcare professional with experience in the use \nof anticancer medicines. \n \nAdults \nDosage is based on your medical condition, body size and response to treatment. It is usually given at \nleast every 6 weeks. The recommended dose of Carmustine Obvius as a single agent in previously \nuntreated patients is 150 to 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 6 weeks. This may be given as a single \ndose or divided into daily infusions such as 75 to 100 mg/m2 on two successive days. Dosage will also \ndepend on whether Carmustine Obvius is given with other anti-cancer medicines. \n \nDoses will be adjusted according to how you respond to the treatment. \n \nThe recommended dose of Carmustine Obvius given in combination with other chemotherapeutic \nagents before haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation is 300 – 600 mg/m2 intravenously. \n \nYour blood count will be monitored frequently to avoid toxicity in your bone marrow and the dose \nadjusted if necessary. \n \nRoute of administration \nFollowing reconstitution and dilution Carmustine Obvius is given into a vein by a drip (intravenously) \nover a one- to two-hour period protected from light. The duration of infusion should not be less than \none hour to avoid burning and pain at the injected area. The injected area will be monitored during the \nadministration. \n \nThe duration of the treatment is determined by the doctor and may vary for each patient. \n \nIf you use more Carmustine Obvius than you should \nAs a doctor or nurse will be giving you this medicine, it is unlikely that you will receive an incorrect \ndose. Tell you doctor or nurse if you have any concern about the amount of medicine that you \nreceived. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n \n4.

Reconstitution and further dilutions should be carried out under \naseptic conditions. \n \nBy following the recommended storage conditions it is possible to avoid any decomposition of the \nunopened vial until the date of expiry mentioned on the packaging. \n \nThe dry frozen product does not contain any preservatives and is suitable only for one use. The \nlyophilisate can appear as a fine powder, however handling can cause it to appear as a more heavy and \nlumpy lyophilisate than as a powdery lyophilisate due to the mechanical instability of the freeze \ndrying cake. The presence of an oily film can be an indication of melting of the medicinal product. \nSuch products are not accepted for use due to the risk of temperature excursions to more than 30°C. \nThis medicinal product should not be used any further. When you are not clear about the fact whether \nthe product is adequately cooled, then you should immediately inspect each and every vial in the \ncarton. For verification, hold the vial in bright light. \n \nReconstitution and dilution of the powder for concentrate for solution for infusion: \nDissolve the 100 mg Carmustine powder for concentrate for solution for infusion with 3 ml of the \nsupplied sterile refrigerated ethanol solvent in the primary packaging (brown glass vial). Carmustine \nmust be completely dissolved in ethanol before sterile water for injections is added. Then aseptically \nadd 27 ml of sterile water for injections to the alcohol solution. The 30 ml stock solution needs to be \nmixed thoroughly. Reconstitution, as recommended, results in a clear, colourless to light yellow stock \nsolution. \nThe 30 ml stock solution is to be diluted immediately by adding the 30 ml stock solution to either \n500 ml glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection or 500 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection in glass containers. The 530 ml diluted solution (i.e. the ready-to-use solution) \nshould be mixed for at least 10 seconds before administration.  \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nThe pH and osmolarity of ready-to-use solutions for infusion: \npH 4.0 to 5.0 and 385-397 mOsm/l (if diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml [5%] solution for injection) and  \npH 4.0 to 6.8 and 370-378 mOsm/l (if diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml [0.9%] solution for \ninjection). \n \nMethod of administration \nThe reconstituted and diluted solution (i.e. ready-to-use solution) must be given intravenously and \nshould be administered by intravenous drip over a one- to two-hour period and administration should \nbe finalised within 3 hours from reconstitution/dilution of the medicinal product. Administration of the \ninfusion should be performed using a PVC free PE infusion set. \nDuring administration of the medicinal product, the container shall be of suitable glass ware. Further, \nthe ready-to-use solutions needs to be protected from light (e.g. using alu-foil wrapped around the \ncontainer of the Ready-to-Use solution) and preferably kept at temperatures below 20-22°C as \ncarmustine degrades faster at higher temperatures.  \nAdministration of the infusion should be performed using a PVC free PE infusion set. \n \nInfusion of Carmustine Obvius over shorter periods of time may produce intense pain and burning at \nthe site of injection. The injected area should be monitored during the administration.  \n \nGuidelines for the safe handling and disposal of antineoplastic agents must be observed. \n \nPosology and laboratory investigations \nInitial doses \nThe recommended dose of Carmustine Obvius as a single agent in previously untreated patients is \n150 to 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 6 weeks. This may be given as a single dose or divided into \ndaily infusions such as 75 to 100 mg/m2 on two successive days. \n \nWhen Carmustine Obvius is used in combination with other myelosuppressive medicinal products or \nin patients in whom bone marrow reserve is depleted, the doses should be adjusted according to the \nhaematologic profile of the patient as shown below. \n \nMonitoring and subsequent doses \nA repeat course of Carmustine Obvius should not be given until circulating blood elements have \nreturned to acceptable levels (platelets above 100,000/mm3, leukocytes above 4,000/mm3), and this is \nusually in six weeks. Blood counts should be monitored frequently and repeat courses should not be \ngiven before six weeks because of delayed haematologic toxicity. \nDoses subsequent to the initial dose should be adjusted according to the haematologic response of the \npatient to the preceding dose in both monotherapy as well as in combination therapy with other \nmyelosuppressive medicinal products. The following schedule is suggested as a guide to dosage \nadjustment: \n \n\nNadir after prior dose Percentage of prior dose \nto be given Leucocytes/mm3 Platelets/mm3 \n\n>4,000 >100,000 100% \n3,000 – 3,999 75,000 - 99,999 100% \n2,000 – 2,999 25,000 - 74,999 70% \n<2,000 <25,000 50% \n\n \nIn cases where the nadir after initial dose does not fall in the same row for leucocytes and platelets \n(e.g. leucocytes >4,000 and platelets <25,000) the value given the lowest percentage of prior dose \nshould be used (e.g. platelets <25,000 then a maximum of 50% of prior dose should be given). \n \nThere are no limits for the period of application of carmustine therapy. In case the tumor remains \nincurable or some serious or intolerable adverse reactions appear, the carmustine therapy must be \nterminated. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nConditioning treatment prior to HPCT \nCarmustine is given in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in patients with malignant \nhaematological diseases before HPCT at a dose of 300 - 600 mg/m2 intravenously. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nCarmustine must not be used in children aged <18 years because of safety concerns. \n \nElderly \nIn general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of \nthe dose range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of \nconcomitant disease or therapy with other medicinal products. Because elderly patients are more likely \nto have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and the glomerular filtration \nrate should be monitored and dose reduced according to this.  \n \nRenal impairment \nFor patients with renal impairment the dose of Carmustine Obvius should be reduced if the glomerular \nfiltration rate is reduced. \n \nCompatibility/Incompatibility with containers \nThe intravenous solution is unstable in polyvinyl chloride containers. All plastic coming into contact \nwith the carmustine solution for infusion (e.g. infusion set etc.) should be PVC free polyethylene \nplastic, otherwise glass ware should be used. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
