NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMemantine LEK 10 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 10 mg of memantine hydrochloride equivalent to 8.31 mg memantine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nYellow, oval film-coated tablet scored in one side. \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of \nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia. Therapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor \nthe intake of the medicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. \nThe tolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three \nmonths after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient\u2019s tolerance of \ntreatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. Maintenance \ntreatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the patient tolerates \ntreatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when evidence of a \ntherapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nDose titration \nThe maximum daily dose is 20 mg per day. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects the maintenance \ndose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows: \n \nWeek 1 (day 1-7): \nThe patient should take half a 10 mg film-coated tablet (5 mg) per day for 7 days. \n \nWeek 2 (day 8-14): \nThe patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet (10 mg) per day for 7 days. \n \nWeek 3 (day 15-21): \nThe patient should take one and a half 10 mg film-coated tablet (15 mg) per day for 7 days. \n \nFrom Week 4 on: \nThe patient should take two 10 mg film-coated tablets (20 mg) per day. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nMaintenance dose \nThe recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nOn the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is 20 mg per \nday (two 10 mg tablets once a day) as described above. \n \nRenal impairment  \nIn patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 \u2013 80 mL/min) no dose adjustment is \nrequired. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 \u2013 49 mL/min) daily dose \nshould be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to \n20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 5 \u2013 29 mL/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B), no dose \nadjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are \navailable. Administration of Memantine LEK is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nMemantine LEK is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of \ndata on safety and efficacy. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nMemantine LEK is for oral use. \nMemantine LEK should be administered once a day and should be taken at the same time every day. The \nfilm-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with \npredisposing factors for epilepsy. \n \nConcomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or \ndextromethorphan should be avoided. These active substances act at the same receptor system as memantine, \nand therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be more frequent or \nmore pronounced (see also section 4.5). \n \nSome factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 \u201cElimination\u201d) may necessitate careful \nmonitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a vegetarian \ndiet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by states of renal \ntubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. \n \nIn most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart failure \n(NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited data are \navailable and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nDue to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following interactions \nmay occur: \n \n\u2022 The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and anticholinergics may \n\nbe enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as memantine. The effects of \nbarbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant administration of memantine with the \nantispasmodic medicinal products, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify their effects and a dose \nadjustment may be necessary. \n\n\u2022 Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of \npharmacotoxic psychosis. Both active substances are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The same \nmay be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one published case report \non a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. \n\n\u2022 Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and nicotine that \nuse the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly interact with memantine \nleading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. \n\n\u2022 There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when memantine is co-\nadministered with HCT or any combination with HCT. \n\n\u2022 In post-marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases have \nbeen reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal relationship has been \nestablished, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for patients concomitantly treated \nwith oral anticoagulants. \n\n \nIn single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance \u2013 active \nsubstance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. \n \nIn a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics of \ngalantamine was observed. \n \nMemantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin-containing monooxygenase, epoxide \nhydrolase or sulphation in vitro. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of memantine in pregnant women. Animal studies \nindicate a potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher \nthan at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine should not \nbe used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse reactions of memantine were noted on male and female fertility. \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nModerate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and compromises \nthe ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Memantine LEK has minor or moderate influence on the ability to \ndrive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care. \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with memantine and 1,595 \npatients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with memantine did not differ \nfrom those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The most \nfrequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the memantine group than in the placebo \ngroup were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs 2.6%), \nsomnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies with \nmemantine and since its introduction in the market.  \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very common \n(\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections \n\n \nImmune system disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity \n\n \nPsychiatric disorders Common  \n\nUncommon  \nUncommon  \nNot known \n\nSomnolence \nConfusion \nHallucinations1 \nPsychotic reactions2 \n \n\nNervous system disorders Common  \nCommon \nUncommon  \nVery rare \n\nDizziness \nBalance disorders \nGait abnormal \nSeizures \n \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure \n \n\nVascular disorders Common  \nUncommon \n\nHypertension \nVenous \nthrombosis/thromboembolism \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common  \nUncommon  \nNot known \n \n\nConstipation \nVomiting \nPancreatitis2 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common \nNot known \n\nElevated liver function test \nHepatitis \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon  \nUncommon \n\nHeadache  \nFatigue \n\n1Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n2Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-marketing \nexperience these reactions have been reported in patients treated with memantine. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing experience. \n \nSymptoms \n \nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with either \nonly symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases below 140 \nmg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system (confusion, drowsiness, \nsomnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) and/or of gastrointestinal \norigin (vomiting and diarrhoea). \n \nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2,000 mg \nmemantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and agitation). \nThe patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered without permanent \nsequelae. \n \nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received 400 mg \nmemantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as restlessness, psychosis, \nvisual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and unconsciousness. \n \nManagement  \n \nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or overdose \nis available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric lavage, carbo \nmedicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, forced diuresis \nshould be used as appropriate. \n \nIn case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics; Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. \n \nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in neurodegenerative \ndementia. \n \nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction. \n \nClinical studies  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n \nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) included a total of 252 \noutpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in comparison to placebo at 6 \nmonths (observed cases analysis for the clinician\u2019s interview based impression of change (CIBIC-plus): \np=0.025; Alzheimer\u2019s disease cooperative study \u2013 activities of daily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; \nsevere impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed a \nstatistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 (last observation \ncarried forward (LOCF)). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease a total of \n470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. In the prospectively defined \nprimary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary efficacy endpoint at week 24. \n \nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) from the \nsix phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies with patients \non a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically significant effect in \nfavour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. When patients were \nidentified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a statistically significant effect of \nmemantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated patients as memantine-treated patients \nshowed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%,p<0.0001). \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. Tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. There is \nno indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. \n \nDistribution  \n \nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to 150 \nng/mL (0.5 - 1 \u03bcmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 L/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. Main \nhuman metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4-and 6-hydroxy-memantine, and \n1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit NMDA-antagonistic activity. No \ncytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. \n \nIn a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within 20 \ndays, more than 99% being excreted renally. \n \nElimination  \nMemantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t\u00bd of 60 to 100 hours. In volunteers \nwith normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 and part of total renal \nclearance is achieved by tubular secretion. \n \nRenal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The renal \nelimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to 9 (see \nsection 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a \nvegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nLinearity  \n \nStudies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  \n \nAt a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki= inhibition constant) of \nmemantine, which is 0.5 \u03bcmol in human frontal cortex. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal vacuolisation \nand necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum concentrations. Ataxia and \nother preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the effects have neither been \nobserved in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical relevance of these findings is \nunknown. \n \nOcular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but not in \nmonkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not disclose any \nocular changes. \n \nPhospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was observed \nin rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic properties. There is a \npossible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed in lungs. This effect was \nonly observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. \n \nNo genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no \nevidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in rats \nand rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse events of memantine were noted on fertility. In \nrats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher than at \nhuman exposure. \n \n \n6.

Animal studies \nindicate a potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher \nthan at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine should not \nbe used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \n \nNo adverse reactions of memantine were noted on male and female fertility. \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nModerate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and compromises \nthe ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Memantine LEK has minor or moderate influence on the ability to \ndrive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care. \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with memantine and 1,595 \npatients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with memantine did not differ \nfrom those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The most \nfrequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the memantine group than in the placebo \ngroup were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs 2.6%), \nsomnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies with \nmemantine and since its introduction in the market.  \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very common \n(\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nundesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections \n\n \nImmune system disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity \n\n \nPsychiatric disorders Common  \n\nUncommon  \nUncommon  \nNot known \n\nSomnolence \nConfusion \nHallucinations1 \nPsychotic reactions2 \n \n\nNervous system disorders Common  \nCommon \nUncommon  \nVery rare \n\nDizziness \nBalance disorders \nGait abnormal \nSeizures \n \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure \n \n\nVascular disorders Common  \nUncommon \n\nHypertension \nVenous \nthrombosis/thromboembolism \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common \nNot known \n\nElevated liver function test \nHepatitis \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common  \nUncommon  \nNot known \n \n\nConstipation \nVomiting \nPancreatitis2 \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n\nCommon  \nUncommon \n\nHeadache  \nFatigue \n \n\n1Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n2Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience. \n \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-marketing \nexperience these reactions have been reported in patients treated with memantine. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing experience. \n \nSymptoms  \n \nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with either \nonly symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases below 140 \nmg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system (confusion, drowsiness, \nsomnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) and/or of gastrointestinal \norigin (vomiting and diarrhoea). \n \nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2,000 mg memantine \nwith effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and agitation). The patient \nreceived symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered without permanent sequelae. \n \nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received 400 mg \nmemantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as restlessness, psychosis, \nvisual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and unconsciousness. \n \nManagement  \n \nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or overdose \nis available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric lavage, carbo \nmedicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, forced diuresis \nshould be used as appropriate. \n \nIn case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics; Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. \n \nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in neurodegenerative \ndementia. \n \nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction. \n \nClinical studies  \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) included a total of 252 \noutpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in comparison to placebo at 6 \nmonths (observed cases analysis for the clinician\u2019s interview based impression of change (CIBIC-plus): \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\np=0.025; Alzheimer\u2019s disease cooperative study \u2013 activities of daily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; \nsevere impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed a \nstatistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 last observation \ncarried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease a total of \n470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. In the prospectively defined \nprimary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary efficacy endpoint at week 24. \n \nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) from the \nsix phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies with patients \non a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically significant effect in \nfavour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. When patients were \nidentified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a statistically significant effect of \nmemantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated patients as memantine-treated patients \nshowed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%,p<0.0001). \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. Tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. There is \nno indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. \n \nDistribution  \n \nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to 150 \nng/mL (0.5 - 1 \u03bcmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 L/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. Main \nhuman metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4-and 6-hydroxy-memantine, and \n1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit NMDA-antagonistic activity. No \ncytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. \n \nIn a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within 20 \ndays, more than 99% being excreted renally. \n \nElimination  \n \nMemantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t\u00bd  of 60 to100 hours. In volunteers \nwith normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 and part of total renal \nclearance is achieved by tubular secretion. \n \nRenal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The renal \nelimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to 9 (see \nsection 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a \nvegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. \n \nLinearity  \n \nStudies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  \n \nAt a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki= inhibition constant) of \nmemantine, which is 0.5 \u03bcmol in human frontal cortex. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal vacuolisation \nand necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum concentrations. Ataxia and \nother preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the effects have neither been \nobserved in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical relevance of these findings is \nunknown. \n \nOcular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but not in \nmonkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not disclose any \nocular changes. \n \nPhospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was observed \nin rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic properties. There is a \npossible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed in lungs. This effect was \nonly observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. \n \nNo genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no \nevidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in rats \nand rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse events of memantine were noted on fertility. In \nrats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher than at \nhuman exposure. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What Memantine LEK is and what it is used for \n \nHow does Memantine LEK work \nMemantine LEK contains the active substance memantine hydrochloride. \nMemantine LEK belongs to a group of medicines known as anti-dementia medicines. \nMemory loss in Alzheimer\u2019s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain \ncontains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve signals \nimportant in learning and memory. Memantine LEK belongs to a group of medicines called NMDA-receptor \nantagonists.
