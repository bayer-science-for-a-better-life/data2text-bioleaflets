NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLedaga 160 micrograms/g gel \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach gram of gel contains chlormethine hydrochloride equivalent to 160 micrograms of chlormethine. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach tube contains 10.5 grams of propylene glycol and 6 micrograms of butylhydroxytoluene. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGel. \n \nClear, colourless gel. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLedaga is indicated for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma \n(MF-type CTCL) in adult patients (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Ledaga should be initiated by an appropriately experienced physician. \n \nPosology \n \nA thin film of Ledaga should be applied once daily to affected areas of the skin. \n \nTreatment with Ledaga should be stopped for any grade of skin ulceration or blistering, or moderately \nsevere or severe dermatitis (e.g., marked skin redness with oedema). Upon improvement, treatment \nwith Ledaga can be restarted at a reduced frequency of once every 3 days. If reintroduction of \ntreatment is tolerated for at least 1 week, the frequency of application can be increased to every other \nday for at least 1 week and then to once-daily application if tolerated. \n \nElderly \n \nThe dosing recommendation for elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years old) is the same as for younger adult \npatients (see section 4.8). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Ledaga in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available. \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nLedaga is for topical application to the skin. \n \nThe following instructions should be followed by patients or caregivers when applying Ledaga: \n \n• Patients must wash hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after handling or \n\napplying Ledaga. Patients should apply Ledaga to affected areas of the skin. In case of Ledaga \nexposure to non-affected areas of the skin, patients should wash the exposed area with soap and \nwater.  \n\n• Caregivers must wear disposable nitrile gloves when applying Ledaga to patients. Caregivers \nshould remove gloves carefully (turning them inside out during the removal to avoid contact \nwith Ledaga) and wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after removal of gloves. If there \nis accidental skin exposure to Ledaga, caregivers must immediately wash exposed areas \nthoroughly with soap and water for at least 15 minutes. Remove and wash contaminated \nclothing. \n\n• The opening of the tube is covered with a foil safety seal. The cap should be used to puncture \nthe seal. The tube should not be used and the pharmacist should be contacted if the seal is \nmissing, punctured, or lifted. \n\n• Ledaga should be applied immediately or within 30 minutes after removal from the refrigerator. \nThe tube should be returned to the refrigerator immediately after each use. With clean hands, \nthe tube should be placed back into the original box and the box should be placed in the \nsupplied transparent, sealable, plastic bag for storage in the refrigerator. \n\n• Ledaga should be applied to completely dry skin at least 4 hours before or 30 minutes after \nshowering or washing. The patient should allow treated areas to dry for 5 to 10 minutes after \napplication before covering with clothing. Occlusive (air- or water-tight) dressings should not \nbe used on areas of the skin where Ledaga was applied.  \n\n• Emollients (moisturisers) or other topical products may be applied to the treated areas 2 hours \nbefore or 2 hours after application of Ledaga. \n\n• Fire, flame, and smoking must be avoided until Ledaga has dried. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to chlormethine or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMucosal or eye exposure  \n \nContact with mucous membranes, especially those of the eyes, must be avoided. Exposure of mucous \nmembranes such as the oral mucosa or nasal mucosa causes pain, redness, and ulceration, and these \nmay be severe. Exposure of the eyes to chlormethine causes pain, burns, inflammation, photophobia, \nand blurred vision. Blindness and severe irreversible anterior eye injury may occur. \n \nPatients should be advised that if any mucous membrane exposure occurs: \n \n• irrigation should be performed immediately for at least 15 minutes with copious amounts of water \n\n(or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, or a balanced salt ophthalmic irrigating \nsolution may be used if there is eye exposure), and \n\n• medical care should be obtained immediately (including ophthalmological consultation if there is \neye exposure). \n\n \nLocal skin reactions \n \nPatients should be assessed during treatment for skin reactions such as dermatitis (e.g., redness, \nswelling, inflammation), pruritus, blisters, ulceration, and skin infections. The face, genitalia, anus, and \nintertriginous skin are at increased risk of skin reactions to topical chlormethine. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nFor dose modification information in case of skin reactions, see section 4.2. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including isolated cases of anaphylaxis, have been reported in the literature \nafter the use of topical formulations of chlormethine (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSkin cancer \n \nSkin-directed therapies for MF-type CTCL have been associated with secondary skin cancers, \nalthough the specific contribution of chlormethine has not been established. Patients should be \nmonitored for development of skin cancers during and after discontinuation of treatment with \nchlormethine. \n \nSecondary exposure to Ledaga \n \nDirect skin contact with Ledaga should be avoided in individuals other than the patient. Risks of \nsecondary exposure may include skin reactions, mucosal injury, and skin cancers. Recommended \napplication instructions should be followed to prevent secondary exposure (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients \n \nThe medicinal product contains propylene glycol and butylhydroxytoluene, which may cause skin \nirritation (e.g., contact dermatitis). In addition, butylhydroxytoluene has been reported to cause \nirritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nLedaga is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the use of chlormethine in pregnant women. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity after systemic administration (see section 5.3). \n \nLedaga is not recommended during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether chlormethine is excreted in human milk. \n \nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded due to the potential for topical or systemic exposure of \nthe breast-feeding child to chlormethine through contact with the mother’s skin. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Ledaga therapy, \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the breast-\nfeeding mother. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nFertility \n \nIn animals, adverse effects of chlormethine on male fertility after systemic administration have been \ndocumented (see section 5.3). The relevance to humans receiving topical chlormethine is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLedaga has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn a randomised-controlled trial (n=128 exposed to Ledaga for a median duration of 52 weeks), the \nmost frequent adverse reactions to Ledaga were skin related: dermatitis (54.7%; e.g., skin irritation, \nerythema, rash, urticaria, skin-burning sensation, pain of the skin), pruritus (20.3%), skin infections \n(11.7%), skin ulceration and blistering (6.3%), and skin hyperpigmentation (5.5%). Cutaneous \nhypersensitivity reactions were reported in 2.3% of the treated patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported with Ledaga in an active-controlled trial in patients with MF-type CTCL \nare shown below. Frequencies were defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing severity. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common Dermatitis, skin infections, pruritus \nCommon Skin ulceration and blistering, skin hyperpigmentation \nImmune system disorders \nCommon Hypersensitivity \n\n \nElderly population \n \nIn the controlled clinical trial, 31% (79/255) of the study population were aged 65 years or older. The \nsafety profile observed in elderly patients was consistent with that in the overall patient population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose after cutaneous use of Ledaga were reported during the clinical development \nprogramme or post-marketing period. Management of overdose should consist of washing the exposed \narea with water. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, nitrogen mustard analogues, ATC code: L01AA05. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n \nMechanism of action \n \nChlormethine is a bifunctional alkylating agent that inhibits rapidly proliferating cells. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Ledaga were assessed in a randomised, multicentre, observer-blinded, \nactive-controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial (Study 201) of 260 adult patients with Stage IA (141), \nIB (115), and IIA (4) MF-type CTCL who had received at least one prior skin-directed therapy. \nQualifying prior therapies included topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, topical bexarotene, and \ntopical nitrogen mustard. Patients were not required to be refractory to or intolerant of prior therapies. \nPatients were stratified based on stage (IA vs IB and IIA) and then randomised to receive either \nLedaga (equivalent to 0.02% chlormethine HCl) or the comparator (a petroleum-based 0.02% \nchlormethine HCl ointment). \n \nStudy medicinal product was to be applied topically once daily for 12 months. Dosing could be \nsuspended or continued at reduced frequency in the case of skin reactions. The median daily usage of \nLedaga was 1.8 g. The maximum individual daily usage in the trial was 10.5 g of gel (i.e., 2.1 mg of \nchlormethine HCl). \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in Study 201 was the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity \n(CAILS) response rate. Assessment was undertaken by a blinded observer. A response was defined as \nan at least 50% improvement in the baseline CAILS score, confirmed at a subsequent visit at least 4 \nweeks later. A complete response was defined as a confirmed CAILS score of 0. A partial response \nwas defined as an at least 50% reduction in the baseline CAILS score. Non-inferiority was considered \nto have been demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval around the ratio of \nresponse rates (Ledaga/comparator) was greater than or equal to 0.75. The CAILS score was adjusted \nby removal of the pigmentation score and simplification of the plaque elevation scale. \n \nAs the main secondary endpoint, patients were also evaluated using the Severity Weighted Assessment \nTool (SWAT), which was based on an assessment of all lesions. The response criteria were the same \nas for CAILS. \n \nEfficacy was evaluated in the Efficacy Evaluable (EE) population, which included all 185 patients \nwho were treated for at least 6 months with no major protocol deviations [Table 1], and in the Intent-\nTo-Treat (ITT) population, which included all 260 randomised patients. \n \nTable 1 CAILS and SWAT-confirmed response rates by 12 months in Study 201 (efficacy \n\nevaluable population) \n\n \nResponse rates (%) \n\nRatio 95% CI \nLedaga \nN=90 \n\nComparator \nN=95 \n\nCAILS Overall Response (CR+PR) \n    Complete Response (CR) \n    Partial Response (PR) \n\n76.7% \n18.9% \n57.8%  \n\n58.9% \n14.7% \n44.2%  \n\n1.301 1.065–1.609 \n\nSWAT Overall Response (CR+PR) \n    Complete Response (CR) \n    Partial Response (PR) \n\n63.3% \n8.9% \n\n54.4% \n\n55.8% \n4.2% \n\n51.6% \n\n1.135 0.893–1.448 \n\nCAILS = Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity; CI = confidence interval; CR = Complete Response; PR = Partial \nResponse; SWAT = Severity Weighted Assessment Tool. \n \nThe ratio of response and the 95% confidence interval in the ITT population were 1.226 (0.974–1.552) \nfor CAILS and 1.017 (0.783–1.321) for SWAT and therefore consistent with those in the EE \npopulation for both the overall CAILS and SWAT responses. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nReductions in mean CAILS scores were observed as early as at 4 weeks, with further reductions \nobserved with continuing therapy. \n \nIn the EE population, the percentage of patients who achieved a confirmed response by CAILS was \nsimilar between disease stages IA (79.6 %) and IB–IIA (73.2%). \n \nResults in other secondary endpoints (response in percentage of body surface area affected, time to \nfirst confirmed CAILS response, duration of first confirmed CAILS response and time to disease \nprogression) were consistent with those for CAILS and SWAT. \n \nA small number of subjects (6.3%, 8/128) treated with Ledaga utilised topical corticosteroids. Thus, \nthe safety of the concomitant use of Ledaga with topical corticosteroids has not yet been established.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nLedaga in all subsets of the paediatric population in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPatients who received Ledaga in Study 201 had no measurable concentrations of chlormethine in \nblood collected 1, 3 and 6 hours post-application on Day 1, and at the first month visit.  \n \nSimilarly, patients who received chlormethine gel 0.04% in a follow-up study (Study 202) had no \nmeasurable concentrations of chlormethine or its degradation product (half-mustard) in blood collected \n1 hour post-application on Day 1 or after 2, 4, or 6 months of treatment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nChlormethine was shown to be genotoxic in bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells. Chlormethine was \ncarcinogenic in rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies after subcutaneous and intravenous \nadministration. \n \nDermal application of chlormethine to mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg for up to 33 weeks resulted in skin \ntumours (squamous cell carcinomas and skin papilloma). There were no reports of systemic tumours \nafter topical administration of chlormethine. \n \nIntravenously administered chlormethine impaired male fertility in rats at a daily dose of ≥ 0.25 mg/kg \nfor 2 weeks.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \nLedaga 160 micrograms/g gel \n\nchlormethine \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Ledaga is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Ledaga \n3. How to use Ledaga \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ledaga \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ledaga is and what it is used for \n \nLedaga contains the active substance chlormethine. This is an anti-cancer medicine used on the skin to \ntreat mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL). \n \nMF-type CTCL is a condition in which certain cells of the body’s immune system called T-\nlymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin. Chlormethine is a type of anti-cancer medicine \ncalled an ‘alkylating agent’. It attaches to the DNA of dividing cells, like cancer cells, which stops \nthem from multiplying and growing. \n \nLedaga is for use in adults only. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Ledaga \n \nDo not use Ledaga \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to chlormethine or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Ledaga. \n \n- Contact with your eyes must be avoided. Do not apply the medicine near the eyes, to the inside \n\nof the nostrils, the inside of the ear or on the lips. \n- If Ledaga gets in your eyes, it can cause pain, burning, swelling, redness, sensitivity to light, and \n\nblurred vision. It may also cause blindness and severe permanent injury to your eyes. If Ledaga \ngets in your eyes, rinse your eyes right away for at least 15 minutes with large amounts of water, \na solution known as “0.9% sodium chloride solution” or an eye-wash solution, and seek medical \nassistance (including an eye doctor) as soon as possible. \n\n- If this medicine gets in your mouth or nose, it can cause pain, redness, and ulcers that may be \nsevere. Rinse the affected area right away for at least 15 minutes with large amounts of water, \nand seek medical assistance as soon as possible. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n- This medicine can cause skin reactions, such as inflammation of your skin (redness and \nswelling), itching, blisters, ulcers and skin infections (see section 4). The risk for inflammation \nof the skin is increased if you apply Ledaga to your face, genital area, anus or skin folds. \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to chlormethine. Contact your doctor \nor seek immediate medical attention if you experience allergic reactions to Ledaga (see section \n4). \n\n- Skin cancers (abnormal growth of the cells in the skin) have been reported after application of \nchlormethine to the skin, although it is not known whether chlormethine causes this. Your \ndoctor will check your skin for skin cancers during and after your treatment with Ledaga. Tell \nyour doctor if you get any new damaged areas or ulcers on your skin. \n\n- Direct skin contact with Ledaga should be avoided in individuals other than the patient, such as \ncaregivers. Risks of direct skin contact include inflammation of the skin (dermatitis), injury to \ntheir eyes, mouth, or nose, and skin cancers. Caregivers who accidentally come into contact \nwith Ledaga must wash the affected area right away for at least 15 minutes. Remove and wash \nany contaminated clothing. Get medical help right away if Ledaga gets into your eyes, mouth, or \nnose. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the safety and \neffectiveness have not been established for this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Ledaga \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, \nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere is limited experience of chlormethine in pregnant women. Therefore, the use of this medicine is \nnot recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age not using contraception. \n \nIt is not known whether Ledaga passes into breast milk, and there may be a risk that the breast-feeding \nbaby is exposed to Ledaga via contact with the mother’s skin. Therefore, it is not recommended to \nbreast-feed while taking this medicine.You should talk to your doctor before breast-feeding to \ndetermine whether or not it is best to breast-feed or to use Ledaga. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \nLedaga contains propylene glycol and butylhydroxytoluene \nPropylene glycol and butylhydroxytoluene may also cause skin irritation. In addition, \nbutylhydroxytoluene may also cause irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes (i.e., mouth and \nnose). \n \n \n3. How to use Ledaga \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nLedaga is intended only for use on the skin. \n \nThe recommended dose is application as a thin film once a day to the affected areas. The dose is the \nsame for elderly patients (aged 65 years and older) as for younger adult patients (aged 18 years and \nolder). \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nYour doctor may stop your treatment if you develop severe inflammation of the skin (i.e., redness and \nswelling), blisters and ulcers. Your doctor may restart the treatment upon improvement of your \nsymptoms. \n \nInstructions for use: \n \n- Use Ledaga exactly as your doctor or pharmacist tells you. \n- Caregivers must wear disposable nitrile gloves when applying this medicine to patients (this is a \n\nspecial type of glove; ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions). \n- Remove the cap from the tube just before use. Use the cap to pierce the seal. \n- Apply Ledaga immediately or within 30 minutes of removing it from the refrigerator. \n- Apply a thin layer of this medicine to completely dry skin at least 4 hours before or 30 minutes \n\nafter showering or washing. \n- Apply Ledaga to affected areas of the skin. In case of Ledaga exposure to non-affected areas of \n\nthe skin, wash the exposed area with soap and water. \n- Allow the area to dry for 5 to 10 minutes after applying your medicine and before covering with \n\nclothing. \n- For patients applying the gel, wash your hands with soap and water immediately after applying. \n- For caregivers applying the gel, carefully remove gloves (turning them inside out during the \n\nremoval to avoid contact with Ledaga) and then wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n- Ledaga is supplied within a child-resistant transparent, sealable, plastic bag. If it is not, ask your \n\npharmacist. \n- With clean hands, place Ledaga back in the box it came in and the box in the plastic bag. Return \n\nit to the refrigerator after each use. \n- Do not cover the treated area with air- or water-tight bandages after you have applied this \n\nmedicine. \n- Until Ledaga has dried on the skin, avoid contact with an open flame or a lit cigarette. Ledaga \n\ncontains alcohol and is therefore considered flammable. \n- Do not apply moisturisers or any other skin products (including medicines applied to the skin) \n\nfor 2 hours before or 2 hours after the daily application of Ledaga. \n- Keep away from children and contact with food by storing Ledaga in its box and inside the \n\nplastic bag. \n \nIf you use Ledaga more than you should \nDo not apply Ledaga more than once per day. If you apply more than recommended, talk to your \ndoctor. \n \nIf you forget to use Ledaga \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Apply your next dose when it is due. \n \nIf you stop using Ledaga \nYour doctor will determine how long you should use Ledaga for and when treatment may be stopped. \nDo not stop using your medicine until your doctor advises you to do so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSTOP taking Ledaga and tell your doctor immediately if you experience allergic reactions \n(hypersensitivity). \n \nThese reactions may include some or all of the following symptoms: \n \n- Swelling of the lips, face, throat or tongue \n\n\n\n24 \n\n- Rash \n- Difficulty breathing \n \nOther side effects may include \nTell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you notice any of the following side effects listed \nbelow. \n \nVery common side effects on the treatment area (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- Skin inflammation \n- Infections of the skin \n- Itching (pruritus) \n \nCommon side effects on the treatment area (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Skin ulcers \n- Blisters \n- Darkening of the skin \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Ledaga \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date, which is stated on the tube label and box after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (+2 °C to +8 °C) at all times, ensuring the tube is in the box inside the child-\nresistant, transparent, sealable, plastic bag. \n \nDo not use an opened or unopened tube of Ledaga after 60 days of storage in the refrigerator. \n \nAsk your pharmacist how to throw away used nitrile gloves, the plastic bag and the medicine you no \nlonger use.
