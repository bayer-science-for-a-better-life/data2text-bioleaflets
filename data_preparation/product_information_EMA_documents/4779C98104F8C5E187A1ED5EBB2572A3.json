This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDupixent 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nDupixent 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nDupilumab 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \nEach single-use pre-filled syringe contains 300 mg of dupilumab in 2 ml solution (150 mg/ml). \n \nDupilumab 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \nEach single-use pre-filled pen contains 300 mg of dupilumab in 2 ml solution (150 mg/ml). \n \nDupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha that inhibits \nIL-4/IL-13 signalling, produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA \ntechnology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nClear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow sterile solution, which is free from visible \nparticulates, with a pH of approximately 5.9. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nAtopic dermatitis \n \nAdults and adolescents \nDupixent is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and \nadolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. \n \nChildren 6 to 11 years of age \nDupixent is indicated for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 to 11 years old who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy. \n \nAsthma \n \nDupixent is indicated in adults and adolescents 12 years and older as add-on maintenance treatment for \nsevere asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised \nfraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), see section 5.1, who are inadequately controlled with high \ndose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  \n \nDupixent is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of adults \nwith severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide \nadequate disease control. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nTreatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of \nconditions for which dupilumab is indicated (see section 4.1). \n \nPosology \n \nAtopic Dermatitis \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of dupilumab for adult patients is an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg \ninjections), followed by 300 mg given every other week administered as subcutaneous injection. \n \nAdolescents (12 to 17 years of age) \nThe recommended dose of dupilumab for adolescent patients 12 to 17 years of age is specified in \nTable 1. \n \nTable 1: Dose of dupilumab for subcutaneous administration in adolescent patients 12 to 17 \nyears of age with atopic dermatitis \n\nBody Weight of \nPatient \n\nInitial Dose Subsequent Doses \n(every other week) \n\nless than 60 kg 400 mg (two 200 mg injections) 200 mg \n60 kg or more 600 mg (two 300 mg injections) 300 mg \n\n \nChildren 6 to 11 years of age \nThe recommended dose of dupilumab for children 6 to 11 years of age is specified in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Dose of dupilumab for subcutaneous administration in children 6 to 11 years of age \nwith atopic dermatitis \n\nBody Weight of \nPatient \n\nInitial Dose Subsequent Doses \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n15 kg to  \nless than 60 kg \n\n300 mg (one 300 mg injection) on Day 1, \nfollowed by 300 mg on Day 15 \n\n300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)*, \nstarting 4 weeks after Day 15 dose  \n\n60 kg or more 600 mg (two 300 mg injections) 300 mg every other week (Q2W) \n\n* The dose may be increased to 200 mg Q2W in patients with body weight of 15 kg to less than 60 kg \nbased on physician’s assessment. \n \nDupilumab can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be \nused, but should be reserved for problem areas only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and genital \nareas. \n \nConsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response \nafter 16 weeks of treatment for atopic dermatitis. Some patients with initial partial response may \nsubsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. If dupilumab treatment interruption \nbecomes necessary, patients can still be successfully re-treated. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAsthma \n \nThe recommended dose of dupilumab for adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) is: \n\n• For patients with severe asthma and who are on oral corticosteroids or for patients with severe \nasthma and co-morbid moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis or adults with co-morbid severe \nchronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg injections), \nfollowed by 300 mg every other week administered as subcutaneous injection. \n\n• For all other patients, an initial dose of 400 mg (two 200 mg injections), followed by 200 mg \nevery other week administered as subcutaneous injection.  \n\nPatients receiving concomitant oral corticosteroids may reduce their steroid dose once clinical \nimprovement with dupilumab has occurred (see section 5.1). Steroid reductions should be \naccomplished gradually (see section 4.4). \n \nDupilumab is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered \nat least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s level of asthma \ncontrol. \n \nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  \n \nThe recommended dose of dupilumab for adult patients is an initial dose of 300 mg followed by \n300 mg given every other week. \n \nDupilumab is intended for long-term treatment. Consideration should be given to discontinuing \ntreatment in patients who have shown no response after 24 weeks of treatment for CRSwNP. Some \npatients with initial partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 24 \nweeks. \n \nMissed dose  \n \nIf a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular \nscheduled time. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years) \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Very limited data \nare available in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment for body weight is recommended for patients with asthma 12 years of age and \nolder or in adults with atopic dermatitis or CRSwNP (see section 5.2). \n \nFor patients 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis, the recommended every other week dose is \n200 mg (< 60 kg) or 300 mg (≥ 60 kg). \n \nFor patients 6 to 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis, the recommended doses are 300 mg Q4W with \nthe possibility to increase to 200 mg Q2W (15 kg to < 60 kg), and 300 mg Q2W (≥ 60 kg). \n \nPaediatric patients \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with atopic dermatitis below the age of 6 years have \nnot been established. The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with a body weight < 15 kg \nhave not been established (see section 5.2). No data are available. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with severe asthma below the age of 12 years have \nnot been established (see section 5.2). No data are available. \n \nCRSwNP does not normally occur in children. The safety and efficacy in children with CRSwNP \nbelow the age of 18 years have not been established (see section 5.2). No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSubcutaneous use \n \nThe dupilumab pre-filled pen is not intended for use in children below 12 years of age. For children 6 \nto 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis, the dupilumab pre-filled syringe is the presentation \nappropriate for administration to this population. \n \nDupilumab is administered by subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, except for the 5 cm \naround the navel.  If somebody else administers the injection, the upper arm can also be used. \n \nFor the initial 600 mg dose, two 300 mg injections should be administered consecutively in different \ninjection sites. \n \nIt is recommended to rotate the injection site with each injection. Dupilumab should not be injected \ninto skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars. \n \nA patient may self-inject dupilumab or the patient's caregiver may administer dupilumab if their \nhealthcare professional determines that this is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to \npatients and/or caregivers on the preparation and administration of dupilumab prior to use according to \nthe Instructions for Use (IFU) section in the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDupilumab should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Dupilumab \nshould not be used to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. \n \nSystemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids should not be discontinued abruptly upon initiation of \ntherapy with dupilumab. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and \nperformed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be \nassociated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by \nsystemic corticosteroid therapy. \n \nBiomarkers of type 2 inflammation may be suppressed by systemic corticosteroid use. This should be \ntaken into consideration to determine type 2 status in patients taking oral corticosteroids (see section \n5.1). \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nIf a systemic hypersensitivity reaction (immediate or delayed) occurs, administration of dupilumab \nshould be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Cases of anaphylactic reaction, \nangioedema, and serum sickness/serum sickness-like reaction have been reported. Anaphylactic \nreactions and angioedema have occurred from minutes to up to seven days after the dupilumab \ninjection (section 4.8). \n \nEosinophilic conditions \n \nCases of eosinophilic pneumonia and cases of vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis \nwith polyangiitis (EGPA) have been reported with dupilumab in adult patients who participated in the \nasthma development program. Cases of vasculitis consistent with EGPA have been reported with \ndupilumab and placebo in adult patients with co-morbid asthma in the CRSwNP development \nprogram. Physicians should be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac \ncomplications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia. Patients being treated \nfor asthma may present with serious systemic eosinophilia sometimes presenting with clinical features \nof eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, \nconditions which are often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not \nalways, may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. \n \nHelminth infection \n \nPatients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. \nDupilumab may influence the immune response against helminth infections by inhibiting IL-4/IL-13 \nsignaling. Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating dupilumab. \nIf patients become infected while receiving treatment with dupilumab and do not respond to anti-\nhelminth treatment, treatment with dupilumab should be discontinued until infection resolves. \n \nConjunctivitis and keratitis related events \n \nConjunctivitis and keratitis related events have been reported with dupilumab, predominantly in atopic \ndermatitis patients. Some patients reported visual disturbances (e.g. blurred vision) associated with \nconjunctivitis or keratitis (section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be advised to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare \nprovider. Patients treated with dupilumab who develop conjunctivitis that does not resolve following \nstandard treatment or signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis should undergo ophthalmological \nexamination, as appropriate (section 4.8).  \n \nAtopic dermatitis or CRSwNP patients with comorbid asthma \n \nPatients on dupilumab for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis or severe CRSwNP who also have co-\nmorbid asthma should not adjust or stop their asthma treatments without consultation with their \nphysicians. Patients with comorbid asthma should be monitored carefully following discontinuation of \ndupilumab. \n \nVaccinations \n \nLive and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with dupilumab as clinical safety \nand efficacy has not been established. Immune responses to TdaP vaccine and meningococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine were assessed, see section 4.5. It is recommended that patients should be \nbrought up to date with live and live attenuated immunisations in agreement with current \nimmunisation guidelines prior to treatment with dupilumab. \n \nSodium content  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 300 mg dose, i.e. essentially \n“sodium-free”.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nImmune responses to vaccination were assessed in a study in which patients with atopic dermatitis \nwere treated once weekly for 16 weeks with 300 mg of dupilumab. After 12 weeks of dupilumab \nadministration, patients were vaccinated with a Tdap vaccine (T cell-dependent), and a meningococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine (T cell-independent) and immune responses were assessed 4 weeks later. \nAntibody responses to both tetanus vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were similar in \ndupilumab-treated and placebo-treated patients. No adverse interactions between either of the non-live \nvaccines and dupilumab were noted in the study.  \n \nTherefore, patients receiving dupilumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. \nFor information on live vaccines see section 4.4. \n \nIn a clinical study of AD patients, the effects of dupilumab on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CYP \nsubstrates were evaluated. The data gathered from this study did not indicate clinically relevant effects \nof dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity. \n \nAn effect of dupilumab on the PK of co-administered medications is not expected. Based on the \npopulation analysis, commonly co-administered medications had no effect on dupilumab \npharmacokinetics on patients with moderate to severe asthma. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of dupilumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nDupilumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \nthe foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether dupilumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue dupilumab therapy \ntaking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies showed no impairment of fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nDupilumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or operate machinery. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nAtopic dermatitis \n \nAdults with atopic dermatitis \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions were injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and oral \nherpes. Very rare cases of serum sickness/serum sickness-like reaction have been reported in the \natopic dermatitis development program (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the monotherapy adult studies, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse \nevents was 1.9 % of the placebo group, 1.9 % of the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 1.5 % of the \ndupilumab 300 mg QW group. In the concomitant TCS adult study, the proportion of patients who \ndiscontinued treatment due to adverse events was 7.6 % of the placebo + TCS group, 1.8 % of the \ndupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group, and 2.9 % of the dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety of dupilumab was evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \nand one dose-ranging study in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. In these 5 trials, 1,689 \nsubjects were treated with subcutaneous injections of dupilumab, with or without concomitant topical \ncorticosteroids (TCS). A total of 305 patients were treated with dupilumab for at least 1 year. \n \nListed in Table 3 are adverse reactions observed in atopic dermatitis clinical trials and/or postmarketing \nsetting presented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: very common \n(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \nvery rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 3: List of adverse reactions in atopic dermatitis \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class \n\nFrequency Adverse Reaction \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nCommon Conjunctivitis \nOral herpes \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nCommon Eosinophilia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nVery rare \nNot known \n\n \n\nSerum sickness/serum sickness-like reactions \nAnaphylactic reaction* \nAngioedema* \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nCommon Headache \n\nEye disorders Common \n \n \nUncommon \n\nConjunctivitis allergic \nEye pruritus  \nBlepharitis \nKeratitis \nUlcerative keratitis \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nNot known Arthralgia* \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common Injection site reactions \n\n* From postmarketing reporting. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nAdolescents with atopic dermatitis (12 to 17 years of age) \n \nThe safety of dupilumab was assessed in a study of 250 patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-\nto-severe atopic dermatitis (AD-1526). The safety profile of dupilumab in these patients followed \nthrough week 16 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adults with atopic dermatitis. \n \nPaediatric patients with atopic dermatitis (6 to 11 years of age) \n \nThe safety of dupilumab was assessed in a trial of 367 patients 6 to 11 years of age with severe atopic \ndermatitis (AD-1652). The safety profile of dupilumab + TCS in these patients through week 16 was \nsimilar to the safety profile from studies in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis. The long-term \nsafety profile of dupilumab observed in children and adolescents was consistent with that seen in adults \nwith atopic dermatitis. \n \n \nAsthma \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reaction was injection site erythema. Anaphylactic reaction has been reported \nvery rarely in the asthma development program (see section 4.4). \n \nIn DRI12544 and QUEST studies, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to \nadverse events was 4.3 % of the placebo group, 3.2 % of the dupilumab 200 mg Q2W group, and \n6.1 % of the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nA total of 2,888 adult and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe asthma were evaluated in 3 \nrandomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration (DRI12544, QUEST, \nand VENTURE). Of these, 2,678 had a history of 1 or more severe exacerbations in the year prior to \nenrolment despite regular use of medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional \ncontroller(s) (DRI12544 and QUEST). A total of 210 patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent \nasthma receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus up to two additional controllers were enrolled \n(VENTURE).  \n \nThe safety profile of dupilumab in the 96 weeks long term safety study (TRAVERSE) was consistent \nwith the safety profile observed in pivotal asthma studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment. \n \nListed in Table 4 are adverse reactions observed in asthma clinical trials and/or postmarketing setting \npresented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 4: List of adverse reactions in asthma \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class \n\nFrequency Adverse Reaction \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nVery rare \nNot known \n\nAnaphylactic reaction \nAngioedema* \n\nEye disorders Rare Keratitis \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nNot known Arthralgia* \n\n\n\n10 \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nInjection site erythema \nInjection site oedema \nInjection site pain  \nInjection site pruritus \n\n* From postmarketing reporting. \n \nChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions were injection site reaction and injection site swelling. \n \nIn the safety pool, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 2.0 % \nof the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group and 4.6 % of the placebo group. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nA total of 722 adult patients with CRSwNP were evaluated in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, \nmulticentre trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration (SINUS-24 and SINUS-52).

Most patients with conjunctivitis or keratitis recovered or were recovering during the \ntreatment period. Among asthma patients frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was low and similar \nbetween dupilumab and placebo. Among CRSwNP patients the frequency of conjunctivitis was higher \n\n\n\n11 \n\nin dupilumab than placebo, though lower than that observed in atopic dermatitis patients. There were \nno cases of keratitis reported in the CRSwNP development program (see section 4.4). \n \nEczema herpeticum \nEczema herpeticum was reported in < 1% of the dupilumab groups and in < 1 % of the placebo group \nin the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy studies. In the 52-week atopic dermatitis dupilumab + \nTCS study, eczema herpeticum was reported in 0.2 % of the dupilumab + TCS group and 1.9 % of the \nplacebo + TCS group. \n \nEosinophilia \nDupilumab-treated patients had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in eosinophil count \ncompared to patients treated with placebo. Eosinophil counts declined to near baseline levels during \nstudy treatment and returned to baseline during the asthma open-label extension safety study \n(TRAVERSE). \n \nTreatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥ 5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in < 2 % of dupilumab-treated \npatients and < 0.5 % in placebo-treated patients. \n \nInfections \nIn the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy clinical studies, serious infections were reported in 1.0 % \nof patients treated with placebo and 0.5 % of patients treated with dupilumab. In the 52-week atopic \ndermatitis CHRONOS study, serious infections were reported in 0.6 % of patients treated with placebo \nand 0.2 % of patients treated with dupilumab. \n \nNo increase was observed in the overall incidence of infections with dupilumab compared to placebo in \nthe safety pool for CRSwNP clinical studies. In the 52-week SINUS-52 study, serious infections were \nreported in 1.3 % of patients treated with dupilumab and 1.3 % of patients treated with placebo. \n \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with dupilumab. \n \nAnti-Drug-Antibodies (ADA) responses were not generally associated with impact on dupilumab \nexposure, safety, or efficacy. \n \nApproximately 5 % of patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, or CRSwNP who received dupilumab \n300 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed ADA to dupilumab; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent \nADA responses and approximately 2 % had neutralizing antibodies. Similar results were observed in \npaediatric patients (6 to 11 years of age) with atopic dermatitis who received dupilumab 200 mg Q2W \nor 300 mg Q4W for 16 weeks. \n \nApproximately 16 % of adolescent patients with atopic dermatitis who received dupilumab 300 mg or \n200 mg Q2W for 16 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 3 % exhibited \npersistent ADA responses, and approximately 5 % had neutralizing antibodies. \n \nApproximately 9 % of patients with asthma who received dupilumab 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks \ndeveloped antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 4 % exhibited persistent ADA responses and \napproximately 4 % had neutralizing antibodies. \n \nRegardless of age or population, approximately 2 to 4 % of patients in the placebo groups were \npositive for antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent ADA response and \napproximately 1 % had neutralizing antibodies. \n \nLess than 1 % of patients who received dupilumab at approved dosing regimens exhibited high titer \nADA responses associated with reduced exposure and efficacy. In addition, there was one patient with \nserum sickness and one with serum sickness-like reaction (< 0.1 %) associated with high ADA titers \n(see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile observed in children with atopic dermatitis aged 6 to 11 years and in adolescents \naged 12 to 17 years in atopic dermatitis and asthma clinical trials was similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe long-term safety of dupilumab was assessed in 89 adolescent patients who were enrolled in an \nopen-label extension study in moderate-to-severe asthma (TRAVERSE). In this study, patients were \nfollowed for up to 96 weeks. The safety profile of dupilumab in TRAVERSE was consistent with the \nsafety profile observed in pivotal asthma studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nThere is no specific treatment for dupilumab overdose. In the event of overdosage, monitor the patient \nfor any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and institute appropriate symptomatic treatment \nimmediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, agents for dermatitis, excluding \ncorticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH05  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 and \ninterleukin-13 signaling. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and \nboth IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα). IL-4 and IL-13 are \nmajor drivers of human type 2 inflammatory disease, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, and CRSwNP. \nBlocking the IL-4/IL-13 pathway with dupilumab in patients decreases many of the mediators of type \n2 inflammation.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn atopic dermatitis clinical trials, treatment with dupilumab was associated with decreases from \nbaseline in concentrations of type 2 immunity biomarkers, such as thymus and activation-regulated \nchemokine (TARC/CCL17), total serum IgE and allergen-specific IgE in serum. A reduction of lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH), a biomarker associated with AD disease activity and severity, was observed \nwith dupilumab treatment in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis. \n \nIn asthma clinical trials, dupilumab treatment markedly decreased FeNO and circulating \nconcentrations of eotaxin-3, total IgE, allergen specific IgE, TARC, and periostin in asthma subjects \nrelative to placebo.  These reductions in type 2 inflammatory biomarkers were comparable for the \n200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W regimens. These markers were near maximal suppression after 2 \nweeks of treatment, except for IgE which declined more slowly. These effects were sustained \nthroughout treatment. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in atopic dermatitis  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\n \nAdults with atopic dermatitis \n \nThe efficacy and safety of dupilumab as monotherapy and with concomitant topical corticosteroids \nwere evaluated in three pivotal randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (SOLO 1, \nSOLO 2, and CHRONOS) in 2,119 patients 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe atopic \ndermatitis (AD) defined by Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 3, an Eczema Area and \nSeverity Index (EASI) score ≥ 16, and a minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥ 10 %. \nEligible patients enrolled into the three studies had previous inadequate response to topical medication. \n \nIn all three studies, patients received 1) an initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab (two 300 mg injections) \non day 1, followed by 300 mg once every two weeks (Q2W); 2) an initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab \non day 1, followed by 300 mg once weekly (QW); or 3) matching placebo. Dupilumab was \nadministered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in all studies. If needed to control intolerable symptoms \nof atopic dermatitis, patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment (which included higher \npotency topical steroids or systemic immunosuppressants) at the discretion of the investigator. Patients \nwho received rescue treatment were considered non-responders. \n \nSOLO 1 enrolled 671 patients (224 to placebo, 224 to dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and 223 to dupilumab \n300 mg QW) and had a treatment period of 16 weeks. \n \nSOLO 2 enrolled 708 patients (236 to placebo, 233 to dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and 239 to dupilumab \n300 mg QW) and had a treatment period of 16 weeks. \n \nCHRONOS enrolled 740 patients (315 to placebo + topical corticosteroid (TCS), 106 to dupilumab \n300 mg Q2W + TCS, and 319 to dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS) and had a treatment period of \n52 weeks. Patients received dupilumab or placebo with concomitant use of TCS starting at baseline \nusing a standardized regimen. Patients were also permitted to use topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI). \n \nEndpoints \nIn all three pivotal studies, the co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 \n(“clear” or “almost clear”) with a reduction of ≥ 2 points on a 0-4 IGA scale and the proportion of \npatients with improvement of at least 75 % in EASI (EASI-75) from baseline to week 16. Other \nevaluated outcomes included the proportion of patients with improvement of at least 50 % and 90 % in \nEASI (EASI-50 and EASI-90, respectively), reduction in itch as measured by the peak pruritus \nNumerical Rating Scale (NRS), and percent change in the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) \nscale from baseline to week 16. Additional secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline \nto week 16 in the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Dermatology Life Quality Index \n(DLQI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. In CHRONOS, efficacy was also \nevaluated at week 52. \n \nBaseline Characteristics \nIn the monotherapy studies (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2), across all treatment groups, the mean age was \n38.3, the mean weight was 76.9 kg, 42.1 % were female, 68.1 % were white, 21.8 % were Asian, and \n6.8  % were black. In these studies, 51.6 % of patients had a baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate AD), \n48.3 % of patients had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe AD) and 32.4 % of patients had received prior \nsystemic immunosuppressants. The baseline mean EASI score was 33.0, the baseline weekly averaged \npruritus NRS was 7.4, the baseline mean SCORAD score was 67.8, the baseline mean POEM score \nwas 20.5, the baseline mean DLQI was 15.0, and the baseline mean HADS total score was 13.3. \nIn the concomitant TCS study (CHRONOS), across all treatment groups, the mean age was 37.1, the \nmean weight was 74.5 kg, 39.7 % were female, 66.2 % were white, 27.2 % were Asian, and 4.6 % \nwere black. In this study, 53.1 % of patients had a baseline IGA score of 3 and 46.9 % of patients had \na baseline IGA of 4 and 33.6 % of patients received prior systemic immunosuppressants. The baseline \nmean EASI score was 32.5, the baseline weekly pruritus NRS was 7.3, the baseline mean SCORAD \nscore was 66.4, the baseline mean POEM score was 20.1, the baseline mean DLQI was 14.5, and the \nbaseline mean HADS total score was 12.7. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nClinical Response \n \n16-Week Monotherapy Studies (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2) \n \nIn SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, from baseline to week 16, a significantly greater proportion of patients \nrandomized to dupilumab achieved an IGA 0 or 1 response, EASI-75, and/or an improvement of > 4 \npoints on the pruritus NRS compared to placebo (see Table 6). \n \nA significantly greater proportion of patients randomized to dupilumab achieved a rapid improvement \nin the pruritus NRS compared to placebo (defined as ≥ 4-point improvement as early as week 2; \np < 0.01) and the proportion of patients responding on the pruritus NRS continued to increase through \nthe treatment period. The improvement in pruritus NRS occurred in conjunction with the improvement \nof objective signs of atopic dermatitis. \n \nFigure 1 and Figure 2 show the mean percent change from baseline in EASI and the mean percent \nchange from baseline in NRS, respectively up to week 16. \n \nTable 6: Efficacy results of dupilumab monotherapy at week 16 (FAS) \n\n SOLO 1 (FAS)a SOLO 2 (FAS)a \n\n Placebo \n \n\nDupilumab \n300 mg Q2W \n\nDupilumab \n300 mg QW \n\nPlacebo Dupilumab \n300 mg Q2W \n\nDupilumab \n300 mg QW \n\nPatients \nrandomised \n\n224 224 223 236 233 239 \n\nIGA 0 or 1b, \n% respondersc \n\n10.3 % 37.9 %e 37.2 %e 8.5 % 36.1 %e 36.4 %e \n\nEASI-50, \n% respondersc \n\n24.6 % 68.8 %e 61.0 %e 22.0 % 65.2 %e 61.1 %e \n\nEASI-75, \n% respondersc \n\n14.7 % 51.3 %e 52.5 %e 11.9 % 44.2 %e 48.1 %e \n\nEASI-90, \n% respondersc \n\n7.6 % 35.7 %e 33.2 %e 7.2 % 30.0 %e 30.5 %e \n\nEASI, LS \nmean % \nchange from \nbaseline (+/-\nSE) \n\n-37.6 % \n(3.28) \n\n-72.3 %e \n(2.63) \n\n-72.0 %e \n(2.56) \n\n-30.9 % \n(2.97) \n\n-67.1 %e \n\n(2.52) \n-69.1 %e \n\n(2.49) \n\nSCORAD, LS \nmean % \nchange from \nbaseline (+/- \nSE) \n\n-29.0 % \n(3.21) \n\n-57.7 %e  \n(2.11) \n\n-57.0 %e \n(2.11) \n\n-19.7 % \n(2.52) \n\n-51.1 %e \n(2.02) \n\n-53.5 %e \n(2.03) \n\nPruritus NRS, \nLS mean % \nchange from \nbaseline (+/- \nSE) \n\n-26.1 % \n(3.02) \n\n-51.0 %e \n(2.50) \n\n-48.9 %e \n(2.60) \n\n-15.4 % \n(2.98) \n\n-44.3 %e \n(2.28) \n\n-48.3 %e \n(2.35) \n\nNumber of \npatients with \nbaseline \npruritus NRS \nscore > 4 \n\n212 213 201 221 225 228 \n\nPruritus NRS \n(> 4-point \nimprovement)\n\n12.3 % \n \n\n40.8 %e \n \n\n40.3 %e  9.5% \n \n\n36.0  %e \n \n\n39.0 %e \n\n\n\n15 \n\n SOLO 1 (FAS)a SOLO 2 (FAS)a \n\n Placebo \n \n\nDupilumab \n300 mg Q2W \n\nDupilumab \n300 mg QW \n\nPlacebo Dupilumab \n300 mg Q2W \n\nDupilumab \n300 mg QW \n\n, % \nrespondersc, d  \n\nLS = least squares; SE= standard error \na Full analysis set (FAS) includes all patients randomized. \nb Responder was defined as a patient with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost clear”) with a reduction \nof > 2 points on a 0-4 IGA scale. \nc Patients who received rescue treatment or with missing data were considered as non-responders. \nd a significantly greater proportion of patients on dupilumab had improvement in pruritus NRS of ≥ 4 \npoints compared to placebo at week 2 (p < 0.01). \ne p-value < 0.0001 \n \nFigure 1: Mean percent change from baseline in EASI in SOLO 1a and SOLO 2a (FAS)b \n \n \n\n \n \nLS = least squares  \n\na In the primary analyses of the efficacy endpoints, patients who received rescue treatment or with \nmissing data were considered non-responders. \nb Full analysis set (FAS) includes all patients randomized. \n \n  \n\nSOLO 1 SOLO 2 \n\n\n\n16 \n\nFigure 2: Mean percent change from baseline in NRS in SOLO 1a and SOLO 2a (FAS)b \n\n \n\n \n\n \nLS = least squares  \n\na In the primary analyses of the efficacy endpoints, patients who received rescue treatment or with \nmissing data were considered non-responders \nb Full analysis set (FAS) includes all patients randomized. \n \nTreatment effects in subgroups (weight, age, gender, race, and background treatment, including \nimmunosuppressants) in SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 were consistent with the results in the overall study \npopulation. \n \n52-Week Concomitant TCS Study (CHRONOS) \n \nIn CHRONOS, a significantly greater proportion of patients randomized to dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + \nTCS achieved an IGA 0 or 1 response, EASI-75, and/or an improvement of > 4 points on the pruritis \nNRS from baseline to week 16 and week 52 compared to placebo + TCS (see Table 7). \n \nA significantly greater proportion of patients randomized to dupilumab + TCS achieved a rapid \nimprovement in the pruritus NRS compared to placebo + TCS (defined as > 4-point improvement as \nearly as week 2; p < 0.05) and the proportion of patients responding on the pruritus NRS continued to \nincrease through the treatment period.

Eligible patients enrolled into \nthis study had previous inadequate response to topical medication. \n \nPatients received 1) an initial dose of 400 mg dupilumab (two 200 mg injections) on day 1, \nfollowed by 200 mg once every other week (Q2W) for patients with baseline weight of < 60 kg or \nan initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab (two 300 mg injections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg Q2W \nfor patients with baseline weight of ≥ 60 kg; 2) an initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab (two 300 mg \ninjections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) regardless of baseline body \nweight; or 3) matching placebo. Dupilumab was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection. If \nneeded to control intolerable symptoms, patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment at the \ndiscretion of the investigator.

Efficacy data from this study suggests that clinical benefit provided at week 16 was sustained \nthrough week 52. \n \nPaediatrics (6 to 11 years of age) \n \nThe efficacy and safety of dupilumab in paediatric patients concomitantly with TCS was evaluated in a \nmulticentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AD-1652) in 367 subjects 6 to 11 \nyears of age, with AD defined by an IGA score of 4 (scale of 0 to 4), an EASI score ≥ 21 (scale of 0 to \n72), and a minimum BSA involvement of ≥ 15 %. Eligible patients enrolled into this trial had previous \ninadequate response to topical medication. Enrollment was stratified by baseline weight (< 30 kg; ≥ 30 \nkg). \n \n\nPatients in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group with baseline weight of < 30 kg received an initial dose \nof 200 mg on Day 1, followed by 100 mg Q2W from week 2 to week 14, and patients with baseline \nweight of ≥ 30 kg received an initial dose of 400 mg on Day 1, followed by 200 mg Q2W from week 2 \nto week 14. Patients in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group received an initial dose of 600 mg on Day 1, \nfollowed by 300 mg Q4W from week 4 to week 12, regardless of weight. Patients were permitted to \nreceive rescue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Patients who received rescue treatment \nwere considered non-responders. \n \nIn this study, the mean age was 8.5 years, the median weight was 29.8 kg, 50.1 % of patients were \nfemale, 69.2 % were White, 16.9 % were Black, and 7.6 % were Asian. At baseline, the mean BSA \ninvolvement was 57.6 %, and 16.9 % had received prior systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants. \nAlso, at baseline the mean EASI score was 37.9, and the weekly average of daily worst itch score was \n7.8 on a scale of 0-10, the baseline mean SCORAD score was 73.6, the baseline POEM score was \n20.9, and the baseline mean CDLQI was 15.1. Overall, 91.7 % of subjects had at least one co-morbid \nallergic condition; 64.4 % had food allergies, 62.7 % had other allergies, 60.2 % had allergic rhinitis, \nand 46.7 % had asthma. \n \nThe co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost clear”) at \nleast a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement of at least \n75 % in EASI), from baseline to week 16. Other evaluated outcomes included the proportion of \npatients with EASI-50 and EASI-90 (improvement of at least 50 % and 90 % in EASI from baseline, \nrespectively), percent change in EASI score from baseline to week 16, and reduction in itch as \nmeasured by the peak pruritus NRS (≥ 4-point improvement).

Efficacy data from this trial suggests that clinical benefit \nprovided at week 16 was sustained through week 52. Some patients receiving dupilumab 300 mg Q4W \n+ TCS showed further clinical benefit when escalated to dupilumab 200 mg Q2W + TCS. The safety \nprofile of dupilumab in patients followed through week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed at \nweek 16 in the AD-1526 and AD-1652 studies. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in asthma  \n \nThe asthma development program included three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nparallel-group, multi-centre studies (DRI12544, QUEST, and VENTURE) of 24 to 52 weeks in \ntreatment duration which enrolled a total of 2,888 patients (12 years of age and older). Patients were \nenrolled without requiring a minimum baseline blood eosinophil or other type 2 inflammatory \nbiomarker (e.g. FeNO or IgE) level. Asthma treatment guidelines define type 2 inflammation as \neosinophilia ≥ 150 cells/mcL and/or FeNO ≥ 20 ppb. In DRI12544 and QUEST, the pre-specified \nsubgroup analyses included blood eosinophils ≥ 150 and ≥ 300 cells/mcL, FeNO ≥ 25 and ≥ 50 ppb.  \n \nDRI12544 was a 24-week dose-ranging study which included 776 patients (18 years of age and older). \nDupilumab compared with placebo was evaluated in adult patients with moderate to severe asthma on \na medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting beta agonist. The primary endpoint \nwas change from baseline to week 12 in FEV1 (L). Annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation \nevents during the 24-week placebo controlled treatment period was also determined. Results were \nevaluated in the overall population (unrestricted by minimum baseline eosinophils or other type 2 \ninflammatory biomarkers) and subgroups based on baseline blood eosinophil count. \n \nQUEST was a 52-week confirmatory study which included 1,902 patients (12 years of age and older). \nDupilumab compared with placebo was evaluated in 107 adolescent and 1,795 adult patients with \npersistent asthma on a medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a second controller \nmedication. Patients requiring a third controller were allowed to participate in this trial. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 200 mg (N=631) or 300 mg (N=633) Dupixent every other week (or \nmatching placebo for either 200 mg (N = 317) or 300 mg (N= 321) every other week) following an \ninitial dose of 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo respectively. The primary endpoints were the annualized \nrate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week placebo controlled period and change from \nbaseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 in the overall population (unrestricted by minimum \nbaseline eosinophils or other type 2 inflammatory biomarkers) and subgroups based on baseline blood \neosinophils count and FeNO.  \n \nVENTURE was a 24-week oral corticosteroid-reduction study in 210 patients with asthma unrestricted \nby baseline type 2 biomarker levels who required daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of \nhigh dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller. After optimizing the OCS dose during \nthe screening period, patients received 300 mg dupilumab (n=103) or placebo (n=107) once every \nother week for 24 weeks following an initial dose of 600 mg or placebo. Patients continued to receive \ntheir existing asthma medicine during the study; however their OCS dose was reduced every 4 weeks \nduring the OCS reduction phase (week 4-20), as long as asthma control was maintained. The primary \nendpoint was the percent reduction in oral corticosteroid dose assessed in the overall population, based \non a comparison of the oral corticosteroid dose at weeks 20 to 24 that maintained asthma control with \nthe previously optimized (at baseline) oral corticosteroid dose. \n \nThe demographics and baseline characteristics of these 3 studies are provided in Table 14 below. \n  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nTable 14: Demographics and Baseline Characteristics of Asthma Trials \n\nParameter DRI12544 \n(n = 776) \n\nQUEST  \n(n = 1902) \n\nVENTURE \n(n=210) \n\nMean age (years) (SD) 48.6 (13.0) 47.9 (15.3) 51.3 (12.6) \n\n% Female 63.1 62.9 60.5 \n\n% White 78.2 82.9 93.8 \n\nDuration of Asthma (years), mean ± SD 22.03 (15.42) 20.94 (15.36) 19.95 (13.90) \n\nNever smoked, (%) 77.4 80.7 80.5 \n\nMean exacerbations in previous year ± SD 2.17 (2.14) 2.09 (2.15) 2.09 (2.16) \n\nHigh dose ICS use (%)a 49.5 51.5 88.6 \n\nPre-dose FEV1 (L) at baseline ± SD 1.84 (0.54) 1.78 (0.60) 1.58 (0.57) \n\nMean percent predicted FEV1 at baseline \n(%)(± SD) \n\n60.77 (10.72) 58.43 (13.52) 52.18 (15.18) \n\n% Reversibility  (± SD) 26.85 (15.43) 26.29 (21.73) 19.47 (23.25) \n\nMean ACQ-5 score (± SD) 2.74 (0.81) 2.76 (0.77) 2.50 (1.16) \n\nMean AQLQ score (± SD) 4.02 (1.09) 4.29 (1.05) 4.35 (1.17) \n\nAtopic Medical History % Overall \n(AD %, NP %, AR %) \n\n72.9 \n(8.0, 10.6, 61.7) \n\n77.7 \n(10.3, 12.7, 68.6) \n\n72.4 \n(7.6, 21.0, 55.7) \n\nMean FeNO ppb (± SD) 39.10 (35.09) 34.97 (32.85) 37.61 (31.38) \n\n% patients with FeNO ppb \n≥ 25 \n≥ 50 \n\n \n49.9 \n21.6 \n\n \n49.6 \n20.5 \n\n \n54.3 \n25.2 \n\nMean total IgE IU/ml (± SD) 435.05 (753.88) 432.40 (746.66) 430.58 (775.96) \n\nMean baseline Eosinophil count (± SD) \ncells/mcL  \n\n350 (430) 360 (370) 350 (310) \n\n% patients with EOS  \n≥ 150 cells/mcL \n≥ 300 cells/mcL \n\n \n77.8 \n41.9 \n\n \n71.4 \n43.7 \n\n \n71.4 \n42.4 \n\nICS = inhaled corticosteroid; FEV1 = Forced expiratory volume in 1 second; ACQ-5 = Asthma Control \nQuestionnaire-5; AQLQ = Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire; AD = atopic dermatitis; NP = nasal polyposis; \nAR = allergic rhinitis; FeNO = fraction of exhaled nitric oxide; EOS = blood eosinophil \naThe population in dupilumab asthma trials included patients on medium and high dose ICS.

All patients were on oral corticosteroids for at least \n6 months prior to the study initiation. The baseline mean oral corticosteroid use was 11.75 mg in the \nplacebo group and 10.75 mg in the group receiving dupilumab. \n \nIn this 24-week trial, asthma exacerbations (defined as a temporary increase in oral corticosteroid dose \nfor at least 3 days) were reduced by 59 % in subjects receiving dupilumab compared with those \nreceiving placebo (annualized rate 0.65 and 1.60 for the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively; \nrate ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.26, 0.63]) and improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to \nweek 24 was greater in subjects receiving dupilumab compared with those receiving placebo (LS mean \ndifference for dupilumab versus placebo of 0.22 L [95% CI: 0.09 to 0.34 L]). Effects on lung function, \non oral steroid and exacerbation reduction were similar irrespective of baseline levels of type 2 \ninflammatory biomarkers (e.g. blood eosinophils, FeNO). The ACQ-5 and AQLQ(S) were also \nassessed in VENTURE and showed improvements similar to those in QUEST.  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \nThe results for VENTURE by baseline biomarkers are presented in the Table 20. \n  \nTable 20: Effect of dupilumab on OCS dose reduction, VENTURE (Baseline Blood Eosinophil \nLevels ≥ 150 and ≥ 300 cells/mcL and FeNO ≥ 25 ppb) \n\n \nBaseline Blood EOS \n\n≥ 150 cells/mcL \n\nBaseline Blood EOS \n≥ 300 cells/mcL \n\nFeNO ≥ 25 ppb \n\nDupilumab \n300 mg Q2W \n\nN=81 \n\nPlacebo \nN=69 \n\nDupilumab \n300 mg Q2W \n\nN=48 \n\nPlacebo \nN=41 \n\nDupilumab \n300 mg Q2W \n\nN=57 \n\nPlacebo \nN=57 \n\nPrimary endpoint (week 24) \nPercent reduction in OCS from baseline  \n\nMean overall percent reduction \nfrom baseline (%) \n\nDifference (% [95% CI]) \n(Dupilumab vs. placebo) \n\n75.91 \n \n\n29.39b  \n\n(15.67, 43.12) \n\n46.51 79.54 \n \n\n36.83b \n(18.94, 54.71) \n\n42.71 77.46 \n \n\n34.53b \n\n(19.08, 49.97) \n\n42.93 \n\nMedian % reduction in daily \nOCS dose from baseline \n\n100 50 100 50 100 50 \n\nPercent reduction from baseline  \n100% % \n≥ 90 % \n≥ 75 % \n≥ 50 % \n> 0 % \nNo reduction or any increase in \nOCS dose, or dropped out of \nstudy \n\n \n54.3 \n58.0 \n72.8 \n82.7 \n87.7 \n12.3 \n\n \n33.3 \n34.8 \n44.9 \n55.1 \n66.7 \n33.3 \n\n \n60.4 \n66.7 \n77.1 \n85.4 \n85.4 \n14.6 \n\n \n31.7 \n34.1 \n41.5 \n53.7 \n63.4 \n36.6 \n\n \n52.6 \n54.4 \n73.7 \n86.0 \n89.5 \n10.5 \n\n \n28.1 \n29.8 \n36.8 \n50.9 \n66.7 \n33.3 \n\nSecondary endpoint (week 24)a \nProportion of patients \nachieving a reduction of OCS \ndose to < 5 mg/day \n\n77 44 84 40 79 34 \n\nOdds ratio (95% CI) 4.29c \n(2.04, 9.04) \n\n 8.04d \n(2.71, 23.82) \n\n 7.21b \n\n(2.69, 19.28) \n \n\naModel estimates by logistic regression \nbp-value < 0.0001  \ncp-value = 0.0001 \ndp-value = 0.0002 \n \nLong-term extension trial (TRAVERSE) \n \nThe long-term safety of dupilumab in 2,193 adults and 89 adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma, \nincluding 185 adults with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma, who had participated in previous \nclinical trials of dupilumab (DRI12544, QUEST, and VENTURE), was assessed in the open-label \nextension study (TRAVERSE) (see section 4.8). Efficacy was measured as a secondary endpoint, was \nsimilar to results observed in the pivotal studies and was sustained up to 96 weeks. In the adults with \noral-corticosteroid-dependent asthma, there was sustained reduction in exacerbations and improvement \nin lung function up to 96 weeks, despite decrease or discontinuation of oral corticosteroid dose. \n \nClinical efficacy in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) \n \nThe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) development program included two \nrandomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre, placebo-controlled studies (SINUS-24 and \nSINUS-52) in 724 patients aged 18 years and older on background intranasal corticosteroids (INCS). \nThese studies included patients with severe CRSwNP despite prior sino-nasal surgery or treatment \n\n\n\n33 \n\nwith, or who were ineligible to receive, systemic corticosteroids in the past 2 years. Rescue with \nsystemic corticosteroids or surgery was allowed during the studies at the investigator’s discretion. In \nSINUS-24, a total of 276 patients were randomised to receive either 300 mg dupilumab (N=143) or \nplacebo (N=133) every other week for 24 weeks. In SINUS-52, 448 patients were randomised to \nreceive either 300 mg dupilumab (N=150) every other week for 52 weeks, 300 mg dupilumab (N=145) \nevery other week until week 24 followed by 300 mg dupilumab every 4 weeks until week 52, or \nplacebo (N=153). All patients had evidence of sinus opacification on the Lund MacKay (LMK) sinus \nCT scan and 73 % to 90 % of patients had opacification of all sinuses. Patients were stratified based on \ntheir histories of prior surgery and co-morbid asthma/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated \nrespiratory disease (NSAID-ERD). \n\nThe co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline to week 24 in bilateral endoscopic nasal \npolyps score (NPS) as graded by central blinded readers, and change from baseline to week 24 in nasal \ncongestion/obstruction score averaged over 28 days (NC), as determined by patients using a daily \ndiary. For NPS, polyps on each side of the nose were graded on a categorical scale (0=no polyps; \n1=small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate; \n2=polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate; 3=large polyps reaching the lower \nborder of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate; 4=large polyps causing \ncomplete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity). The total score was the sum of the right and left \nscores. Nasal congestion was rated daily by the subjects on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0=no \nsymptoms; 1=mild symptoms; 2=moderate symptoms; 3=severe symptoms).  \nIn both studies, key secondary end-points at week 24 included change from baseline in: LMK sinus CT \nscan score, total symptoms score (TSS), University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT), \ndaily loss of smell, and 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). In the pool of the two studies, \nthe reduction in the proportion of patients rescued with systemic corticosteroid and/or sino-nasal \nsurgery as well as the improvement in FEV1 in the asthma subgroup were evaluated.

SINUS-52 \n\n  \n \nIn both studies, significant improvements in NC and daily loss of smell severity were observed as \nearly as the first assessment at week 4. The LS mean difference for NC at week 4 in the dupilumab \ngroup versus placebo was -0.41 (95% CI: -0.52, -0.30) in SINUS-24 and -0.37 (95% CI: -0.46, -0.27) \nin SINUS-52. The LS mean difference for loss of smell at week 4 in the dupilumab group versus \nplacebo was -0.34 (95% CI: -0.44, -0.25) in SINUS-24 and -0.31 (95% CI: -0.41, -0.22) in SINUS-52. \nA reduction in the proportion of patients with anosmia was observed in SINUS-24 and SINUS-52. At \nbaseline, 74 % to 79 % of patients had anosmia, which was reduced to 24 % in SINUS-24 and 30 % in \nSINUS-52 at week 24, compared to no change in placebo. Improvement in nasal peak inspiratory flow \n(NPIF) was observed in SINUS-24 and SINUS-52 at week 24. The LS mean difference in the \ndupilumab group versus placebo was 40.4 L/min (95% CI: 30.4, 50.4) and 36.6 L/min (95% CI: 28.0, \n45.3), respectively. \n \nAmong the patients with rhinosinusitis VAS score > 7 at baseline, a higher percentage of patients \nachieved VAS ≤ 7 in the dupilumab group compared with the placebo group (83.3 % versus 39.4 % in \nSINUS-24 and 75.0 % versus 39.3 % in SINUS-52) at week 24. \n \nIn the pre-specified multiplicity-adjusted pooled analysis of two studies, treatment with dupilumab \nresulted in significant reduction of systemic corticosteroid use and need for sino-nasal surgery versus \nplacebo (HR of 0.24; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.35) (see Figure 9). The proportion of patients who required \nsystemic corticosteroids was reduced by 74 % (HR of 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.38). The total number of \nsystemic corticosteroid courses per year was reduced by 75 % (RR of 0.25; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.37). The \nmean individual annualised prescribed total dose of systemic corticosteroids (in mg) during the \ntreatment period was 71 % lower in the pooled dupilumab group compared with the pooled placebo \ngroup (60.5 [531.3] mg versus 209.5 [497.2] mg, respectively). The proportion of patients who \nrequired surgery was reduced by 83 % (HR of 0.17; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.46). \n \n  \n\n\n\n37 \n\nFigure 9. Kaplan Meier Curve for time to first systemic corticosteroid use and/or sino-nasal \nsurgery during treatment period - ITT population [SINUS-24 and SINUS-52 pooled] \n\n \n\n \n\nThe effects of dupilumab on the primary endpoints of NPS and nasal congestion and the key secondary \nendpoint of LMK sinus CT scan score were consistent in patients with prior surgery and without prior \nsurgery. \n \nIn patients with co-morbid asthma, significant improvements in FEV1 and ACQ-6 were observed at \nweek 24 irrespective of baseline blood eosinophils levels. The pooled LS Mean change from baseline \nin FEV1 at week 24 for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W was 0.14 vs -0.07 L for placebo, for a difference of \n0.21 L (95% CI: 0.13, 0.29). In addition, improvements in FEV1 were noted from the first \npost-baseline assessment, at week 8 in SINUS-24 and week 4 in SINUS-52. Improvements in ACQ-6 \nin patients with co-morbid asthma were observed in both studies. A response was defined as an \nimprovement in score of 0.5 or more. The LS mean difference in the dupilumab group versus placebo \nat week 24 was -0.76 (95% CI: -1.00 to -0.51) in SINUS-24 and -0.94 (95% CI: -1.19, -0.69) in \nSINUS-52. \n\nThe ACQ-6 responder rate for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W for SINUS-24 at week 24 was 56 % versus \n28 % in placebo (odds ratio 3.17; 95% CI: 1.65, 6.09). The ACQ-6 responder rate for dupilumab 300 \nmg Q2W for SINUS-52 was 46 % versus 14 % placebo at week 52 (odds ratio 7.02; 95% CI: 3.10, \n15.90). \nIn patients with NSAID-ERD, the effects of dupilumab on the primary endpoints of NPS and NC and \nthe key secondary endpoint of LMK sinus CT scan score were consistent with that observed in the \noverall CRSwNP population. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAtopic dermatitis  \nThe safety and efficacy of dupilumab have been established in 12 to 17 years old with moderate-to-\nsevere atopic dermatitis in study AD-1526 which included 251 adolescents. The safety and efficacy of \ndupilumab have been established in 6 to 11 years old with severe atopic dermatitis in study AD-1652 \nwhich included 367 paediatric patients. Use is supported by study AD-1434 which enrolled patients \nwho had completed AD-1526 (136 moderate and 64 severe at the time of enrolment in study AD-\n1434) and patients who had completed study AD-1652 (110 moderate and 72 severe at the time of \nenrolment in in study AD-1434). The safety and efficacy were generally consistent between children 6 \nto 11 years old, adolescent, and adult patients with atopic dermatitis (see section 4.8). Safety and \nefficacy in paediatric patients < 6 years of age with atopic dermatitis have not been established. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nAsthma \nA total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with moderate to severe asthma were enrolled in \nQUEST study and received either 200 mg (N=21) or 300 mg (N=18) dupilumab (or matching placebo \neither 200 mg [N=34] or 300 mg [N=34]) every other week. Efficacy with respect to severe asthma \nexacerbations and lung function was observed in both adolescents and adults. For both the 200 mg and \n300 mg every other week doses, significant improvements in FEV1 (LS mean change from baseline at \neek 12) were observed (0.36 L and 0.27 L, respectively). For the 200 mg every other week dose, \npatients had a reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations that was consistent with adults. Safety and \nefficacy in paediatric patients (< 12 years of age) with severe asthma have not been established. The \nadverse event profile in adolescents was generally similar to the adults. \n \nA total of 89 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with moderate-to-severe asthma were enrolled in the \nopen label long-term study (TRAVERSE). In this study, efficacy was measured as a secondary \nendpoint, was similar to results observed in the pivotal studies and was sustained up to 96 weeks. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ndupilumab in one or more subset of the paediatric population in atopic dermatitis and asthma (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). The European Medicines Agency has waived the \nobligation to submit the results of studies with dupilumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nthe treatment of nasal polyposis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of dupilumab is similar in patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, and \nCRSwNP. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 75-600 mg dupilumab to adults, median times to maximum \nconcentration in serum (tmax) were 3-7 days. The absolute bioavailability of dupilumab following a SC \ndose is similar between AD, asthma, and CRSwNP patients, ranging between 61 % and 64 %, as \ndetermined by a population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. \n \nSteady-state concentrations were achieved by week 16 following the administration of 600 mg starting \ndose and 300 mg dose every other week or 300 mg dose every other week without a loading dose. \nAcross clinical trials, the mean ±SD steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 69.2±36.9 mcg/ml \nto 80.2±35.3 mcg/ml for 300 mg dose and from 29.2±18.7 to 36.5±22.2 mcg/ml for 200 mg dose \nadministered every other week to adults. \n \nDistribution \n \nA volume of distribution for dupilumab of approximately 4.6 L was estimated by population PK \nanalysis, indicating that dupilumab is distributed primarily in the vascular system. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSpecific metabolism studies were not conducted because dupilumab is a protein. Dupilumab is \nexpected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. \n \nElimination \n \nDupilumab elimination is mediated by parallel linear and nonlinear pathways. At higher \nconcentrations, dupilumab elimination is primarily through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway, while \nat lower concentrations, the non-linear saturable IL-4R α target-mediated elimination predominates. \nAfter the last steady state dose, the median time for dupilumab concentrations to decrease below the \nlower limit of detection, estimated by population PK analysis, was 6-7 weeks for the 300 mg Q4W \n\n\n\n39 \n\nregimen, 9 weeks for the 200 mg Q2W regimen, 10-11 weeks for the 300 mg Q2W regimen, and 13 \nweeks for the 300 mg QW regimen. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nDue to nonlinear clearance, dupilumab exposure, as measured by area under the concentration-time \ncurve, increases with dose in a greater than proportional manner following single SC doses from 75-\n600 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGender \nGender was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure \nof dupilumab determined by population PK analysis. \n \nElderly \nOf the 1,472 patients with atopic dermatitis exposed to dupilumab in a phase 2 dose-ranging study or \nphase 3 placebo-controlled studies, a total of 67 were 65 years or older. Although no differences in \nsafety or efficacy were observed between older and younger adult atopic dermatitis patients, the \nnumber of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently \nfrom younger patients. \n \nAge was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure of \ndupilumab determined by population PK analysis. However, there were only 61 patients over 65 years \nof age included in this analysis. \n \nOf the 1,977 patients with asthma exposed to dupilumab, a total of 240 patients were 65 years or older \nand 39 patients were 75 years or older. Efficacy and safety in this age group were similar to the overall \nstudy population. \n \nThere were only 79 patients older than 65 years with CRSwNP exposed to dupilumab among them 11 \npatients were 75 years and older. \n \nRace \nRace was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure \nof dupilumab by population PK analysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination. No \nclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of dupilumab. \n \nRenal impairment \nDupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination. No \nclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of dupilumab.  Population PK analysis did not identify mild or moderate renal \nimpairment as having a clinically meaningful influence on the systemic exposure of dupilumab. Very \nlimited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nBody Weight \nDupilumab trough concentrations were lower in subjects with higher body weight with no meaningful \nimpact on efficacy. There were only 6 patients exposed to dupilumab with body weight ≥130 kg in \nCRSwNP clinical studies. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAtopic dermatitis \n\n\n\n40 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric patients (< 6 years of age) or body weight < 15 kg \nwith atopic dermatitis has not been studied. \n \nFor adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every other week dosing (Q2W) \nwith either 200 mg (< 60 kg) or 300 mg (≥ 60 kg), the mean ±SD steady state trough concentration of \ndupilumab was 54.5±27.0 mcg/ml. \n \nFor children 6 to 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every four week dosing (Q4W) with \n300 mg (≥ 15 kg) in AD-1652, the mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration was 76.3±37.2 \nmcg/ml. At week 16 in AD-1434 in children 6 to 11 years of age who initiated every four week dosing \n(Q4W) with 300 mg (≥ 15 kg), and whose dose was increased to every other week dosing (Q2W) with \n200 mg (≥ 15 to < 60 kg) or 300 mg (≥ 60 kg), the mean±SD steady-state trough concentration was \n108±53.8 mcg/ml. For children 6 to 11 years of age receiving 300 mg Q4W, initial doses of 300 mg on \nDays 1 and 15 produce similar steady-state exposure as an initial dose of 600 mg on Day 1, based on \nPK simulations \n \nAsthma  \nA total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with asthma were enrolled in QUEST study. The mean \n±SD steady-state trough concentrations of dupilumab were 107±51.6 mcg/ml and 46.7±26.9 mcg/ml, \nrespectively, for 300 mg or 200 mg administered every other week. No age-related pharmacokinetic \ndifference was observed in adolescent patients after correction for body weight. \n \nCRSwNP \nCRSwNP does not normally occur in children. The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric \npatients (< 18 years of age) with CRSwNP has not been studied. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity (including safety pharmacology endpoints) and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nThe mutagenic potential of dupilumab has not been evaluated; however monoclonal antibodies are not \nexpected to alter DNA or chromosomes. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with dupilumab. An evaluation of the available \nevidence related to IL-4Rα inhibition and animal toxicology data with surrogate antibodies does not \nsuggest an increased carcinogenic potential for dupilumab. \n \nDuring a reproductive toxicology study conducted in monkeys, using a surrogate antibody specific to \nthe monkey IL-4Rα, no fetal abnormalities were observed at dosages that saturate the IL-4Rα.  \n \nAn enhanced pre- and post-natal developmental study revealed no adverse effects in maternal animals \nor their offspring up to 6 months post-partum/post-birth. \n \nFertility studies conducted in male and female mice using a surrogate antibody against IL-4Rα showed \nno impairment of fertility (see section 4.6). \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nAtopic dermatitis \n \nAdults and adolescents \nDupixent is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and \nadolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. \n \nChildren 6 to 11 years of age \nDupixent is indicated for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 to 11 years old who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy. \n \nAsthma \n \nDupixent is indicated in adults and adolescents 12 years and older as add-on maintenance treatment for \nsevere asthma with type 2 inflammation characterised by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised \nfraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), see section 5.1, who are inadequately controlled with high \ndose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.  \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nTreatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of \nconditions for which dupilumab is indicated (see section 4.1). \n \nPosology \n \nAtopic Dermatitis \n \nAdolescents(12 to 17 years of age) \nThe recommended dose of dupilumab for adolescent patients 12 to 17 years of age is specified in \nTable 1. \n \nTable 1: Dose of dupilumab for subcutaneous administration in adolescent patients 12 years to \n17 years of age with atopic dermatitis \n\nBody Weight of \nPatient \n\nInitial Dose Subsequent Doses \n(every other week) \n\nless than 60 kg 400 mg (two 200 mg injections) 200 mg \n60 kg or more 600 mg (two 300 mg injections) 300 mg \n\n \nChildren 6 to 11 years of age \nThe recommended dose of dupilumab for children 6 to 11 years of age is specified in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Dose of dupilumab for subcutaneous administration in children 6 to 11 years of age \nwith atopic dermatitis \n\nBody Weight of \nPatient \n\nInitial Dose Subsequent Doses \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n15 kg to  \nless than 60 kg \n\n300 mg (one 300 mg injection) on Day 1, \nfollowed by 300 mg on Day 15 \n\n300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)*, \nstarting 4 weeks after Day 15 dose \n\n60 kg or more 600 mg (two 300 mg injections) 300 mg every other week (Q2W) \n\n* The dose may be increased to 200 mg Q2W in patients with body weight of 15 kg to less than 60 kg \nbased on physician’s assessment. \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of dupilumab for adult patients is an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg \ninjections), followed by 300 mg given every other week administered as subcutaneous injection. \n \nDupilumab can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be \nused, but should be reserved for problem areas only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and genital \nareas. \n \nConsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response \nafter 16 weeks of treatment for atopic dermatitis. Some patients with initial partial response may \nsubsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. If dupilumab treatment interruption \nbecomes necessary, patients can still be successfully re-treated. \n \nAsthma \n \nThe recommended dose of dupilumab for adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) is: \n• An initial dose of 400 mg (two 200 mg injections), followed by 200 mg given every other week \n\nadministered as subcutaneous injection.  \n• For patients with severe asthma and who are on oral corticosteroids or for patients with severe \n\nasthma and co-morbid moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis or adults with co-morbid severe \n\n\n\n45 \n\nchronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg injections), \nfollowed by 300 mg every other week administered as subcutaneous injection. \n \n\nPatients receiving concomitant oral corticosteroids may reduce their steroid dose once clinical \nimprovement with dupilumab has occurred (see section 5.1). Steroid reductions should be \naccomplished gradually (see section 4.4). \n \nDupilumab is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered \nat least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s level of asthma \ncontrol. \n \nMissed dose  \n \nIf a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular \nscheduled time. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years) \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Very limited data \nare available in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo data are available in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nBody weight \nNo dose adjustment for body weight is recommended for patients with asthma 12 years of age and \nolder or in adults with atopic dermatitis (see section 5.2). \n \nFor patients 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis, the recommended every other week dose is \n200 mg (< 60 kg) or 300 mg (≥ 60 kg). \n \nFor patients 6 to 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis, the recommended doses are 300 mg Q4W with \nthe possibility to increase to 200 mg Q2W (15 kg to < 60 kg), and 300 mg Q2W (≥ 60 kg). \n \nPaediatric patients \nThe safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with atopic dermatitis below the age of 6 years have \nnot been established. The safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with a body weight < 15 kg \nhave not been established (see section 5.2). No data are available. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of dupilumab in children with severe asthma below the age of 12 years have \nnot been established (see section 5.2). No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSubcutaneous use \n \nThe dupilumab pre-filled pen is not intended for use in children below 12 years of age. For children 6 \nto 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis, the dupilumab pre-filled syringe is the presentation \nappropriate for administration to this population. \n \nDupilumab is administered by subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, except for the 5 cm \naround the navel.  If somebody else administers the injection, the upper arm can also be used. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nFor the initial 400 mg dose, two 200 mg injections should be administered consecutively in different \ninjection sites. \n \nIt is recommended to rotate the injection site with each injection. Dupilumab should not be injected \ninto skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars. \n \nA patient may self-inject dupilumab or the patient's caregiver may administer dupilumab if their \nhealthcare professional determines that this is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to \npatients and/or caregivers on the preparation and administration of dupilumab prior to use according to \nthe Instructions for Use (IFU) section in the package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDupilumab should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Dupilumab \nshould not be used to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. \n \nSystemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids should not be discontinued abruptly upon initiation of \ntherapy with dupilumab. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and \nperformed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be \nassociated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by \nsystemic corticosteroid therapy. \n \nBiomarkers of type 2 inflammation may be suppressed by systemic corticosteroid use. This should be \ntaken into consideration to determine type 2 status in patients taking oral corticosteroids (see section \n5.1). \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nIf a systemic hypersensitivity reaction (immediate or delayed) occurs, administration of dupilumab \nshould be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Cases of anaphylactic reaction, \nangioedema, and serum sickness/serum sickness-like reaction have been reported. Anaphylactic \nreactions and angioedema have occurred from minutes to up to seven days after the dupilumab \ninjection (section 4.8). \n \nEosinophilic conditions \n \nCases of eosinophilic pneumonia and cases of vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis \nwith polyangiitis have been reported with dupilumab in adult patients who participated in the asthma \ndevelopment program. Physicians should be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, \ncardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia. Patients being \ntreated for asthma may present with serious systemic eosinophilia sometimes presenting with clinical \nfeatures of eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis, conditions which are often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events \nusually, but not always, may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. \n \nHelminth infection \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nPatients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. \nDupilumab may influence the immune response against helminth infections by inhibiting IL-4/IL-13 \nsignaling. Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating dupilumab. \nIf patients become infected while receiving treatment with dupilumab and do not respond to anti-\nhelminth treatment, treatment with dupilumab should be discontinued until infection resolves. \n \nConjunctivitis and keratitis related events \n \nConjunctivitis and keratitis related events have been reported with dupilumab, predominantly in atopic \ndermatitis patients. Some patients reported visual disturbances (e.g. blurred vision) associated with \nconjunctivitis or keratitis (section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be advised to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare \nprovider. Patients treated with dupilumab who develop conjunctivitis that does not resolve following \nstandard treatment or signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis should undergo ophthalmological \nexamination, as appropriate (section 4.8).  \n \nAtopic dermatitis patients with comorbid asthma \n \nPatients on dupilumab for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who also have comorbid asthma \nshould not adjust or stop their asthma treatments without consultation with their physicians. Patients \nwith comorbid asthma should be monitored carefully following discontinuation of dupilumab.  \n \nVaccinations \n \nLive and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with dupilumab as clinical safety \nand efficacy has not been established. Immune responses to TdaP vaccine and meningococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine were assessed, see section 4.5. It is recommended that patients should be \nbrought up to date with live and live attenuated immunisations in agreement with current \nimmunisation guidelines prior to treatment with dupilumab. \n \nSodium content  \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 200 mg dose, i.e. essentially \n“sodium-free”.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nImmune responses to vaccination were assessed in a study in which patients with atopic dermatitis \nwere treated once weekly for 16 weeks with 300 mg of dupilumab. After 12 weeks of dupilumab \nadministration, patients were vaccinated with a Tdap vaccine (T cell-dependent), and a meningococcal \npolysaccharide vaccine (T cell-independent) and immune responses were assessed 4 weeks later. \nAntibody responses to both tetanus vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were similar in \ndupilumab-treated and placebo-treated patients. No adverse interactions between either of the non-live \nvaccines and dupilumab were noted in the study.  \n \nTherefore, patients receiving dupilumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. \nFor information on live vaccines see section 4.4. \n \nIn a clinical study of AD patients, the effects of dupilumab on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CYP \nsubstrates were evaluated. The data gathered from this study did not indicate clinically relevant effects \nof dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity. \n \nAn effect of dupilumab on the PK of co-administered medications is not expected. Based on the \npopulation analysis, commonly co-administered medications had no effect on dupilumab \npharmacokinetics on patients with moderate to severe asthma. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of dupilumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nDupilumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \nthe foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether dupilumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue dupilumab therapy \ntaking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies showed no impairment of fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nDupilumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nAtopic dermatitis \n \nAdults with atopic dermatitis \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions were injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and oral \nherpes. Very rare cases of serum sickness/serum sickness-like reaction have been reported in the atopic \ndermatitis development program (see section 4.4). \n \nIn the monotherapy adult studies, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse \nevents was 1.9 % of the placebo group, 1.9 % of the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 1.5 % of the \ndupilumab 300 mg QW group. In the concomitant TCS adult study, the proportion of patients who \ndiscontinued treatment due to adverse events was 7.6 % of the placebo + TCS group, 1.8 % of the \ndupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group, and 2.9 % of the dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety of dupilumab was evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \nand one dose-ranging study in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. In these 5 trials, 1,689 \nsubjects were treated with subcutaneous injections of dupilumab, with or without concomitant topical \ncorticosteroids (TCS). A total of 305 patients were treated with dupilumab for at least 1 year. \n \nListed in Table 3 are adverse reactions observed in atopic dermatitis clinical trials and/or postmarketing \nsetting presented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: very common \n(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); \nvery rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 3: List of adverse reactions in atopic dermatitis \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class \n\nFrequency Adverse Reaction \n\n\n\n49 \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nCommon Conjunctivitis \nOral herpes \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nCommon Eosinophilia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nVery rare \nNot known \n \n\nSerum sickness/serum sickness-like reactions \nAnaphylactic reaction* \nAngioedema* \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nCommon Headache \n\nEye disorders Common \n \n \nUncommon \n\nConjunctivitis allergic \nEye pruritus  \nBlepharitis \nKeratitis \nUlcerative keratitis \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nNot known Arthralgia* \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common Injection site reactions \n\n* From postmarketing reporting. \n \nAdolescents with atopic dermatitis (12 to 17 years of age) \n \nThe safety of dupilumab was assessed in a study of 250 patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-\nto-severe atopic dermatitis (AD-1526). The safety profile of dupilumab in these patients followed \nthrough week 16 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adults with atopic dermatitis. \n \nPaediatric patients with atopic dermatitis (6 to 11 years of age) \n \nThe safety of dupilumab was assessed in a trial of 367 patients 6 to 11 years of age with severe atopic \ndermatitis (AD-1652). The safety profile of dupilumab + TCS in these patients through week 16 was \nsimilar to the safety profile from studies in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis. The long-term \nsafety profile of dupilumab observed in children and adolescents was consistent with that seen in adults \nwith atopic dermatitis. \n \nAsthma \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reaction was injection site erythema. Anaphylactic reaction has been reported \nvery rarely in the asthma development program (see section 4.4). \n \nIn DRI12544 and QUEST studies, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to \nadverse events was 4.3 % of the placebo group, 3.2 % of the dupilumab 200 mg Q2W group, and \n6.1 % of the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nA total of 2,888 adult and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe asthma were evaluated in 3 \nrandomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration (DRI12544, QUEST, \nand VENTURE). Of these, 2,678 had a history of 1 or more severe exacerbations in the year prior to \nenrolment despite regular use of medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional \ncontroller(s) (DRI12544 and QUEST). A total of 210 patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent \nasthma receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus up to two additional controllers were enrolled \n(VENTURE).  \n \nThe safety profile of dupilumab in the 96 weeks long term safety study (TRAVERSE) was consistent \nwith the safety profile observed in pivotal asthma studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment. \n \nListed in Table 4 are adverse reactions observed in asthma clinical trials and/or postmarketing setting \npresented by system organ class and frequency, using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 4: List of adverse reactions in asthma \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class \n\nFrequency Adverse Reaction \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nVery rare \nNot known \n\nAnaphylactic reaction \nAngioedema* \n\nEye disorders Rare Keratitis \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nNot known Arthralgia* \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nInjection site erythema \nInjection site oedema \nInjection site pain \nInjection site pruritus \n\n* From postmarketing reporting. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions in atopic dermatitis and asthma indications \n \nHypersensitivity \nCases of anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, and serum sickness/serum sickness-like reaction have been \nreported following administration of dupilumab (see section 4.4). \n \nConjunctivitis and keratitis related events \nConjunctivitis and keratitis occurred more frequently in atopic dermatitis patients who received \ndupilumab. Most patients with conjunctivitis or keratitis recovered or were recovering during the \ntreatment period. Among asthma patients frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was low and similar \nbetween dupilumab and placebo (see section 4.4). \n \nEczema herpeticum \nEczema herpeticum was reported in < 1 % of the dupilumab groups and in < 1 % of the placebo group \nin the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy studies. In the 52-week atopic dermatitis dupilumab + \nTCS study, eczema herpeticum was reported in 0.2 % of the dupilumab + TCS group and 1.9 % of the \nplacebo + TCS group. \n \nEosinophilia \nDupilumab-treated patients had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in eosinophil count \ncompared to patients treated with placebo. Eosinophil counts declined to near baseline levels during \n\n\n\n51 \n\nstudy treatment and returned to baseline during the asthma open-label extension safety study \n(TRAVERSE). \n \nTreatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥ 5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in < 2 % of dupilumab-treated \npatients and < 0.5 % in placebo-treated patients. \n \nInfections \nIn the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy clinical studies, serious infections were reported in 1.0 % \nof patients treated with placebo and 0.5 % of patients treated with dupilumab. In the 52-week atopic \ndermatitis CHRONOS study, serious infections were reported in 0.6 % of patients treated with placebo \nand 0.2 % of patients treated with dupilumab. \n \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with dupilumab. \n \nAnti-Drug-Antibodies (ADA) responses were not generally associated with impact on dupilumab \nexposure, safety, or efficacy. \n \nApproximately 6 % of patients with atopic dermatitis or asthma who received dupilumab 300 mg \nQ2W for 52 weeks developed ADA to dupilumab; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent ADA \nresponses and approximately 2 % had neutralizing antibodies. Similar results were observed in \npaediatric patients (6 to 11 years of age) with atopic dermatitis who received dupilumab 200 mg Q2W \nor 300 mg Q4W for 16 weeks. \n \nApproximately 16 % of adolescent patients with atopic dermatitis who received dupilumab 300 mg or \n200 mg Q2W for 16 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 3 % exhibited \npersistent ADA responses, and approximately 5 % had neutralizing antibodies \n \nApproximately 9 % of patients with asthma who received dupilumab 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks \ndeveloped antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 4 % exhibited persistent ADA responses and \napproximately 4 % had neutralizing antibodies. \n \nRegardless of age or population, approximately 2 to 4 % of patients in the placebo groups were \npositive for antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent ADA response and \napproximately 1 % had neutralizing antibodies. \n \nLess than 1 % of patients who received dupilumab at approved dosing regimens exhibited high titer \nADA responses associated with reduced exposure and efficacy. In addition, there was one patient with \nserum sickness and one with serum sickness-like reaction (< 0.1 %) associated with high ADA titers \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety profile observed in children with atopic dermatitis aged 6 to 11 years and in adolescents \naged 12 to 17 years in atopic dermatitis and asthma clinical trials was similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe long-term safety of dupilumab was assessed in 89 adolescent patients who were enrolled in an \nopen-label extension study in moderate-to-severe asthma (TRAVERSE). In this study, patients were \nfollowed for up to 96 weeks. The safety profile of dupilumab in TRAVERSE was consistent with the \nsafety profile observed in pivotal asthma studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n52 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nThere is no specific treatment for dupilumab overdose. In the event of overdosage, monitor the patient \nfor any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and institute appropriate symptomatic treatment \nimmediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, agents for dermatitis, excluding \ncorticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH05  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 and \ninterleukin-13 signaling. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and \nboth IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα). IL-4 and IL-13 are \nmajor drivers of human type 2 inflammatory disease, such as atopic dermatitis and asthma. Blocking \nthe IL-4/IL-13 pathway with dupilumab in patients decreases many of the mediators of type 2 \ninflammation.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn atopic dermatitis clinical trials, treatment with dupilumab was associated with decreases from \nbaseline in concentrations of type 2 immunity biomarkers, such as thymus and activation-regulated \nchemokine (TARC/CCL17), total serum IgE and allergen-specific IgE in serum. A reduction of lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH), a biomarker associated with AD disease activity and severity, was observed \nwith dupilumab treatment in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis. \n \nIn asthma clinical trials, dupilumab treatment markedly decreased FeNO and circulating \nconcentrations of eotaxin-3, total IgE, allergen specific IgE, TARC, and periostin in asthma subjects \nrelative to placebo.  These reductions in type 2 inflammatory biomarkers were comparable for the \n200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W regimens. These markers were near maximal suppression after 2 \nweeks of treatment, except for IgE which declined more slowly. These effects were sustained \nthroughout treatment. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in atopic dermatitis \n \nAdolescents with atopic dermatitis (12 to 17 years of age) \n \nThe efficacy and safety of dupilumab monotherapy in adolescent patients was evaluated in a \nmulticentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AD-1526) in 251 adolescent \npatients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) defined by \nInvestigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 in the overall assessment of AD lesions on a \nseverity scale of 0 to 4, an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score ≥ 16 on a scale of 0 to \n72, and a minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥10 %. Eligible patients enrolled into \nthis study had previous inadequate response to topical medication. \n \nPatients received 1) an initial dose of 400 mg dupilumab (two 200 mg injections) on day 1, \nfollowed by 200 mg once every other week (Q2W) for patients with baseline weight of < 60 kg or \nan initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab (two 300 mg injections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg Q2W \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n53 \n\nfor patients with baseline weight of ≥ 60 kg; 2) an initial dose of 600 mg dupilumab (two 300 mg \ninjections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) regardless of baseline body \nweight; or 3) matching placebo. Dupilumab was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection. If \nneeded to control intolerable symptoms, patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment at the \ndiscretion of the investigator. Patients who received rescue treatment were considered non-\nresponders. \n \nIn this study, the mean age was 14.5 years, the median weight was 59.4 kg, 41.0 % were female, \n62.5 % were White, 15.1 % were Asian, and 12.0 % were Black. At baseline 46.2 % of patients \nhad a baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate AD), 53.8 % of patients had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe \nAD), the mean BSA involvement was 56.5 %, and 42.4  % of patients had received prior \nsystemic immunosuppressants. Also at baseline the mean Eczema Area and Severity Index \n(EASI) score was 35.5, the baseline weekly averaged pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was \n7.6, the baseline mean SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score was 70.3, the baseline \nmean Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) score was 21.0, and the baseline mean Children \nDermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) was 13.6. Overall, 92.0 % of patients had at least one \nco-morbid allergic condition; 65.6 % had allergic rhinitis, 53.6 % had asthma, and 60.8 % had \nfood allergies. \nThe co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost \nclear”) least a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement \nof at least 75 % in EASI), from baseline to week 16. Other evaluated outcomes included the \nproportion of subjects with EASI-50 or EASI-90 (improvement of at least 50 % or 90 % in EASI \nfrom baseline respectively), reduction in itch as measured by the peak pruritus NRS, and percent \nchange in the SCORAD scale from baseline to week 16. Additional secondary endpoints \nincluded mean change from baseline to week 16 in the POEM and CDLQI scores. \n\nClinical Response \n \nThe efficacy results at week 16 for adolescent atopic dermatitis study are presented in Table 5. \n \nTable 5: Efficacy results of dupilumab in the adolescent atopic dermatitis study at Week 16 (FAS) \n\n AD-1526(FAS)a \n\n Placebo \n \n\nDupilumab \n200 mg (< 60 kg) and  \n\n300 mg (≥ 60 kg)  \nQ2W \n\nPatients randomised 85a 82a \n\nIGA 0 or 1b, % respondersc 2.4 % 24.4 % \nEASI-50, % respondersc 12.9 % 61.0 % \n\nEASI-75, % respondersc 8.2 % 41.5 % \nEASI-90, % respondersc 2.4 % 23.2 % \nEASI, LS mean % change from baseline (+/-SE) -23.6 % \n\n(5.49) \n-65.9 % \n(3.99) \n\nSCORAD, LS mean % change from baseline \n(+/- SE) \n\n-17.6 % \n(3.76) \n\n-51.6 % \n(3.23) \n\nPruritus NRS, LS mean % change from baseline \n(+/- SE) \n\n-19.0 % \n(4.09) \n\n-47.9 % \n(3.43) \n\nPruritus NRS (> 4-point improvement), % \nrespondersc  \n\n4.8 % 36.6 % \n\nBSA LS mean % change from baseline  \n(+/- SE) \n\n-11.7 % \n(2.72) \n\n-30.1 % \n(2.34) \n\nCDLQI, LS mean change from baseline  \n(+/-SE) \n\n-5.1 \n(0.62) \n\n-8.5 \n(0.50) \n\nCDLQI, (≥ 6-point improvement), % responders 19.7 % 60.6 % \nPOEM, LS mean change from baseline  -3.8 -10.1 \n\n\n\n54 \n\n AD-1526(FAS)a \n\n Placebo \n \n\nDupilumab \n200 mg (< 60 kg) and  \n\n300 mg (≥ 60 kg)  \nQ2W \n\n(+/- SE) (0.96) (0.76) \nPOEM, (≥ 6-point improvement), % responders 9.5 % 63.4 % \n\na Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all patients randomised. \nb Responder was defined as a subject with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost clear”) with a reduction of ≥ 2 points \n\non a 0-4 IGA scale. \nc Patients who received rescue treatment or with missing data were considered as non-responders (58.8 % and \n\n20.7 % in the placebo and dupilumab arms, respectively).  \nAll p –values < 0.0001 \n \nA larger percentage of patients randomised to placebo needed rescue treatment (topical corticosteroids, \nsystemic corticosteroids, or systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants) as compared to the \ndupilumab group (58.8 % and 20.7 %, respectively). \n \nA significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to dupilumab achieved a rapid improvement \nin the pruritus NRS compared to placebo (defined as > 4-point improvement as early as week 4; \nnominal p< 0.001) and the proportion of patients responding on the pruritus NRS continued to increase \nthrough the treatment period (see Figure 1). The improvement in pruritus NRS occurred in conjunction \nwith the improvement of objective signs of atopic dermatitis. \n \nFigure 1: Proportion of adolescent patients with ≥ 4-point improvement on the pruritus NRS in \nAD-1526 studya (FAS)b \n\n \na In the primary analyses of the efficacy endpoints, subjects who received rescue treatment or with missing data \nwere considered non-responders. \nb Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all subjects randomised. \n \nThe dupilumab group significantly improved patient-reported symptoms, the impact of AD on sleep \nand health-related quality of life as measured by POEM, SCORAD, and CDLQI scores at 16 weeks \ncompared to placebo. \n \nThe long-term efficacy of dupilumab in adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had \nparticipated in previous clinical trials of dupilumab was assessed in open-label extension study (AD-\n1434). Efficacy data from this study suggests that clinical benefit provided at week 16 was sustained \nthrough week 52. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nPaediatrics (6 to 11 years of age) \n\nThe efficacy and safety of dupilumab in paediatric patients concomitantly with TCS was evaluated in a \nmulticentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AD-1652) in 367 subjects 6 to 11 \nyears of age, with AD defined by an IGA score of 4 (scale of 0 to 4), an EASI score ≥ 21 (scale of 0 to \n72), and a minimum BSA involvement of ≥ 15 %. Eligible patients enrolled into this trial had previous \ninadequate response to topical medication. Enrollment was stratified by baseline weight (< 30 kg; ≥ 30 \nkg). \n\nPatients in the dupilumab Q2W + TCS group with baseline weight of < 30 kg received an initial dose \nof 200 mg on Day 1, followed by 100 mg Q2W from week 2 to week 14, and patients with baseline \nweight of ≥ 30 kg received an initial dose of 400 mg on Day 1, followed by 200 mg Q2W from week 2 \nto week 14. Patients in the dupilumab Q4W + TCS group received an initial dose of 600 mg on Day 1, \nfollowed by 300 mg Q4W from week 4 to week 12, regardless of weight. Patients were permitted to \nreceive rescue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Patients who received rescue treatment \nwere considered non-responders. \n\nIn this study, the mean age was 8.5 years, the median weight was 29.8 kg, 50.1 % of patients were \nfemale, 69.2 % were White, 16.9 % were Black, and 7.6 % were Asian. At baseline, the mean BSA \ninvolvement was 57.6 %, and 16.9 % had received prior systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants. \nAlso, at baseline the mean EASI score was 37.9, and the weekly average of daily worst itch score was \n7.8 on a scale of 0-10, the baseline mean SCORAD score was 73.6, the baseline POEM score was \n20.9, and the baseline mean CDLQI was 15.1. Overall, 91.7 % of subjects had at least one co-morbid \nallergic condition; 64.4 % had food allergies, 62.7 % had other allergies, 60.2 % had allergic rhinitis, \nand 46.7 % had asthma. \n\nThe co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost clear”) at \nleast a 2-point improvement and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 (improvement of at least \n75 % in EASI), from baseline to week 16. Other evaluated outcomes included the proportion of \npatients with EASI-50 and EASI-90 (improvement of at least 50 % and 90 % in EASI from baseline, \nrespectively), percent change in EASI score from baseline to week 16, and reduction in itch as \nmeasured by the peak pruritus NRS (≥ 4-point improvement).

Patients were \nenrolled without requiring a minimum baseline blood eosinophil or other type 2 inflammatory \nbiomarkers (e.g. FeNO or IgE) level. Asthma treatment guidelines define type 2 inflammation as \neosinophilia ≥ 150 cells/mcL and/or FeNO ≥ 20 ppb. In DRI12544 and QUEST, the pre-specified \nsubgroup analyses included blood eosinophils ≥ 150 and ≥ 300 cells/mcL, FeNO ≥ 25 and ≥ 50 ppb. \n \nDRI12544 was a 24-week dose-ranging study which included 776 patients (18 years of age and older). \nDupilumab compared with placebo was evaluated in adult patients with moderate to severe asthma on \na medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting beta agonist. The primary endpoint \nwas change from baseline to week 12 in FEV1 (L). Annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation \nevents during the 24-week placebo controlled treatment period was also determined. Results were \nevaluated in the overall population (unrestricted by minimum baseline eosinophils or other type 2 \ninflammatory biomarkers) and subgroups based on baseline blood eosinophil count.  \n \nQUEST was a 52-week confirmatory study which included 1,902 patients (12 years of age and older). \nDupilumab compared with placebo was evaluated in 107 adolescent and 1,795 adult patients with \npersistent asthma on a medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a second controller \nmedication. Patients requiring a third controller were allowed to participate in this trial. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 200 mg (N=631) or 300 mg (N=633) Dupixent every other week (or \nmatching placebo for either 200 mg (N = 317) or 300 mg (N= 321) every other week) following an \ninitial dose of 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo respectively. The primary endpoints were the annualized \nrate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week placebo controlled period and change from \nbaseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 in the overall population (unrestricted by minimum \nbaseline eosinophils or other type 2 inflammatory biomarkers) and subgroups based on baseline blood \neosinophils count and FeNO. \n \nVENTURE was a 24-week oral corticosteroid-reduction study in 210 patients with asthma unrestricted \nby baseline type 2 biomarker levels who required daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of \nhigh dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller. After optimizing the OCS dose during \nthe screening period, patients received 300 mg dupilumab (n=103) or placebo (n=107) once every \nother week for 24 weeks following an initial dose of 600 mg or placebo. Patients continued to receive \ntheir existing asthma medicine during the study; however their OCS dose was reduced every 4 weeks \nduring the OCS reduction phase (week 4-20), as long as asthma control was maintained.

All patients were on oral corticosteroids for at least 6 \nmonths prior to the study initiation. The baseline mean oral corticosteroid use was 11.75 mg in the \nplacebo group and 10.75 mg in the group receiving dupilumab. \n \nIn this 24-week trial, asthma exacerbations (defined as a temporary increase in oral corticosteroid dose \nfor at least 3 days) were reduced by 59 % in subjects receiving dupilumab compared with those \nreceiving placebo (annualized rate 0.65 and 1.60 for the dupilumab and placebo group, respectively; \nrate ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.26, 0.63]) and improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to \nweek 24 was greater in subjects receiving dupilumab compared with those receiving placebo (LS mean \ndifference for dupilumab versus placebo of 0.22 L [95% CI: 0.09 to 0.34 L]). Effects on lung function, \non oral steroid and exacerbation reduction were similar irrespective of baseline levels of type 2 \ninflammatory biomarkers (e.g. blood eosinophils, FeNO).

Efficacy was measured as a secondary endpoint, was \nsimilar to results observed in the pivotal studies and was sustained up to 96 weeks. In the adults with \noral-corticosteroid-dependent asthma, there was sustained reduction in exacerbations and improvement \nin lung function up to 96 weeks, despite decrease or discontinuation of oral corticosteroid dose. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAtopic dermatitis  \nThe safety and efficacy of dupilumab have been established in 12 to 17 years old with moderate-to-\nsevere atopic dermatitis in study AD-1526 which included 251 adolescents. The safety and efficacy of \ndupilumab have been established in 6 to 11 years old with severe atopic dermatitis in study AD-1652 \nwhich included 367 paediatric patients. Use is supported by study AD-1434 which enrolled patients \nwho had completed AD-1526 (136 moderate and 64 severe at the time of enrolment in study AD-\n1434) and patients who had completed study AD-1652 (110 moderate and 72 severe at the time of \nenrolment in in study AD-1434). The safety and efficacy were generally consistent between children 6 \nto 11 years old, adolescent, and adult patients with atopic dermatitis (see section 4.8). Safety and \nefficacy in paediatric patients < 6 years of age with atopic dermatitis have not been established. \n \nAsthma \nA total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with moderate to severe asthma were enrolled in \nQUEST study and received either 200 mg (N=21) or 300 mg (N=18) dupilumab (or matching placebo \neither 200 mg [N=34] or 300 mg [N=34]) every other week. Efficacy with respect to severe asthma \nexacerbations and lung function was observed in both adolescents and adults.  For both the 200 mg \nand 300 mg every other week doses, significant improvements in FEV1 (LS mean change from \nbaseline at week 12) were observed (0.36 L and 0.27 L, respectively). For the 200 mg every other \nweek dose, patients had a reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations that was consistent with adults. \nSafety and efficacy in paediatric patients (< 12 years of age) with severe asthma have not been \nestablished. The adverse event profile in adolescents was generally similar to the adults. \n \nA total of 89 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with moderate-to-severe asthma were enrolled in the \nopen label long-term study (TRAVERSE). In this study, efficacy was measured as a secondary \nendpoint, was similar to results observed in the pivotal studies and was sustained up to 96 weeks. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ndupilumab in one or more subset of the paediatric population in atopic dermatitis and asthma (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of dupilumab is similar in patients with atopic dermatitis and asthma. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 75-600 mg dupilumab to adults, median times to maximum \nconcentration in serum (tmax) were 3-7 days. The absolute bioavailability of dupilumab following a SC \ndose is similar between AD and asthma patients, ranging between 61 % and 64  %, as determined by a \npopulation pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. \n \nSteady-state concentrations were achieved by week 16 following the administration of 600 mg starting \ndose and 300 mg dose every other week. Across clinical trials, the mean ±SD steady-state trough \n\n\n\n64 \n\nconcentrations ranged from 60.3±35.1 mcg/ml to 79.9±41.4 mcg/ml for 300 mg dose and from \n29.2±18.7 to 36.5±22.2 mcg/ml for 200 mg dose administered every other week to adults. \n \nDistribution \n \nA volume of distribution for dupilumab of approximately 4.6 L was estimated by population PK \nanalysis, indicating that dupilumab is distributed primarily in the vascular system. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSpecific metabolism studies were not conducted because dupilumab is a protein. Dupilumab is \nexpected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. \n \nElimination \n \nDupilumab elimination is mediated by parallel linear and nonlinear pathways. At higher \nconcentrations, dupilumab elimination is primarily through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway, while \nat lower concentrations, the non-linear saturable IL-4R α target-mediated elimination predominates. \nAfter the last steady state dose, the median time for dupilumab concentrations to decrease below the \nlower limit of detection, estimated by population PK analysis, was 6-7 weeks for the 300 mg Q4W \nregimen, 9 weeks for the 200 mg Q2W regimen, 10-11 weeks for the 300 mg Q2W regimen, and 13 \nweeks for the 300 mg QW regimen. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nDue to nonlinear clearance, dupilumab exposure, as measured by area under the concentration-time \ncurve, increases with dose in a greater than proportional manner following single SC doses from 75-\n600 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGender \nGender was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure \nof dupilumab determined by population PK analysis. \n \nElderly \nOf the 1,472 patients with atopic dermatitis exposed to dupilumab in a phase 2 dose-ranging study or \nphase 3 placebo-controlled studies, a total of 67 were 65 years or older. Although no differences in \nsafety or efficacy were observed between older and younger adult atopic dermatitis patients, the \nnumber of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently \nfrom younger patients. \n \nAge was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure of \ndupilumab determined by population PK analysis. However, there were only 61 patients over 65 years \nof age included in this analysis. \n \nOf the 1,977 patients with asthma exposed to dupilumab, a total of 240 patients were 65 years or older \nand 39 patients were 75 years or older. Efficacy and safety in this age group were similar to the overall \nstudy population. \n \nRace \nRace was not found to be associated with any clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure \nof dupilumab by population PK analysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n\n\n65 \n\nDupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination. No \nclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of dupilumab. \n \nRenal impairment \nDupilumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination. No \nclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of dupilumab.  Population PK analysis did not identify mild or moderate renal \nimpairment as having a clinically meaningful influence on the systemic exposure of dupilumab. Very \nlimited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nBody Weight \nDupilumab trough concentrations were lower in subjects with higher body weight with no meaningful \nimpact on efficacy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAtopic dermatitis \nThe pharmacokinetics of dupilumab in paediatric patients (< 6 years of age) or body weight < 15 kg \nwith atopic dermatitis has not been studied. \n \nFor adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every other week dosing (Q2W) \nwith either 200 mg (<60 kg) or 300 mg (≥60 kg), the mean ±SD steady state trough concentration of \ndupilumab was 54.5±27.0 mcg/ml. \n \nFor children 6 to 11 years of age with atopic dermatitis receiving every four week dosing (Q4W) with \n300 mg (≥ 15 kg) in AD-1652, the mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration was 76.3±37.2 \nmcg/ml. At week 16 in AD-1434 in children 6 to 11 years of age who initiated every four week dosing \n(Q4W) with 300 mg (≥ 15 kg), and whose dose was increased to every other week dosing (Q2W) with \n200 mg (≥ 15 to < 60 kg) or 300 mg (≥ 60 kg), the mean±SD steady-state trough concentration was \n108±53.8 mcg/ml. For children 6 to 11 years of age receiving 300 mg Q4W, initial doses of 300 mg on \nDays 1 and 15 produce similar steady-state exposure as an initial dose of 600 mg on Day 1, based on \nPK simulations. \n \nAsthma \nA total of 107 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with asthma were enrolled in QUEST study. The mean \n±SD steady-state trough concentrations of dupilumab were 107±51.6 mcg/ml and 46.7±26.9 mcg/ml, \nrespectively, for 300 mg or 200 mg administered every other week. No age-related pharmacokinetic \ndifference was observed in adolescent patients after correction for body weight. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity (including safety pharmacology endpoints) and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nThe mutagenic potential of dupilumab has not been evaluated; however monoclonal antibodies are not \nexpected to alter DNA or chromosomes. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with dupilumab. An evaluation of the available \nevidence related to IL-4Rα inhibition and animal toxicology data with surrogate antibodies does not \nsuggest an increased carcinogenic potential for dupilumab. \n \nDuring a reproductive toxicology study conducted in monkeys, using a surrogate antibody specific to \nthe monkey IL-4Rα, no fetal abnormalities were observed at dosages that saturate the IL-4Rα.  \n \nAn enhanced pre- and post-natal developmental study revealed no adverse effects in maternal animals \nor their offspring up to 6 months post-partum/post-birth. \n\n\n\n66 \n\nFertility studies conducted in male and female mice using a surrogate antibody against IL-4Rα showed \nno impairment of fertility (see section 4.6). \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Dupixent is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Dupixent \n3. How to use Dupixent \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Dupixent \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Dupixent is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Dupixent is \nDupixent contains the active substance dupilumab. \n \nDupilumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein) that blocks the action of proteins \ncalled IL-4 and IL-13. Both play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, \nasthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). \n \nWhat Dupixent is used for \nDupixent is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic \ndermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Dupixent is also used to treat children 6 to 11 years old with \nsevere atopic dermatitis. Dupixent may be used with eczema medicines that you apply to the skin or it \nmay be used on its own.  \n \nDupixent is also used with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in \nadults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) whose asthma is not controlled with their current \nasthma medicines. \n \nDupixent is also used with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of CRSwNP in adults whose \ndisease is not controlled with their current CRSwNP medicines. Dupixent can also reduce the need for \nsurgery and the need for systemic corticosteroid use. \n \nHow Dupixent works \nUsing Dupixent for atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) can improve the condition of your skin and \nreduce itching. Dupixent has also been shown to improve symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression \nassociated with atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dupixent helps improve your sleep disturbance and \noverall quality of life. \n \n\n\n\n104 \n\nDupixent helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. \nDupixent may also help reduce the amount of another group of medicines you need to control your \nasthma, called oral corticosteroids, while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your \nbreathing. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Dupixent \n \nDo not use Dupixent  \n• if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• if you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for \n\nadvice before using Dupixent. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dupixent: \n \nDupixent is not a rescue medicine and should not be used to treat a sudden asthma attack. \n \nAllergic reactions \n• Very rarely, Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions \n\nand anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. These reactions can occur from minutes until seven \ndays after Dupixent administration. You must look out for signs of these conditions (i.e. breathing \nproblems, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, throat or tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling \nlightheaded (low blood pressure), fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, \njoint pain, skin rash) while you are taking Dupixent. Such signs are listed under “Serious side \neffects” in section 4. \n\n• Stop using Dupixent and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs \nof an allergic reaction. \n \n\nEosinophilic conditions \n• Rarely patients taking an asthma medicine may develop inflammation of blood vessels or lungs \n\ndue to an increase of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia). \n• It is not known whether this is caused by Dupixent. This usually, but not always, happens in \n\npeople who also take a steroid medicine which is being stopped or for which the dose is being \nlowered. \n\n• Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms such as a flu-like illness, \npins and needles or numbness of arms or legs, worsening of pulmonary symptoms, and/or rash. \n \n\nParasitic (intestinal parasites) infection \n• Dupixent may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a \n\nparasitic infection it should be treated before you start treatment with Dupixent. \n• Check with your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration \n\nwhich could be a sign of a parasitic infection. \n• If you live in a region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region \n\ncheck with your doctor. \n \nAsthma \nIf you have asthma and are taking asthma medicines, do not change or stop your asthma medicine \nwithout talking to your doctor. Talk to your doctor before you stop Dupixent or if your asthma remains \nuncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine. \n \nEye problems \nTalk to your doctor if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in \nvision. \n \n\n\n\n105 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n• The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with atopic dermatitis below the \n\nage of 6. \n• The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with asthma below the age of \n\n12. \n• CRSwNP does not normally occur in children. The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet \n\nknown in children with CRSwNP below the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Dupixent \nTell your doctor or pharmacist  \n• if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n• if you have recently had or are due to have a vaccination. \n \nOther medicines for asthma \nDo not stop or reduce your asthma medicines, unless instructed by your doctor. \n• These medicines (especially ones called corticosteroids) must be stopped gradually. \n• This must be done under the direct supervision of your doctor and dependent on your response to \n\nDupixent. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n• If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known; \ntherefore it is preferable to avoid the use of Dupixent in pregnancy unless your doctor advises to \nuse it. \n\n• If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this \nmedicine. You and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use Dupixent. You should \nnot do both. \n\n \nDriving and using machines  \nDupixent is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nDupixent contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 300 mg dose, i.e., it is essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n \n3.

What Dupixent is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Dupixent is \nDupixent contains the active substance dupilumab. \n \nDupilumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein) that blocks the action of proteins \ncalled IL-4 and IL-13. Both play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, \nasthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). \n \nWhat Dupixent is used for \nDupixent is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic \ndermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Dupixent is also used to treat children 6 to 11 years old with \nsevere atopic dermatitis (see section Children and adolescents). Dupixent may be used with eczema \nmedicines that you apply to the skin or it may be used on its own.  \n \nDupixent is also used with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in \nadults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) whose asthma is not controlled with their current \nasthma medicines. \n \nDupixent is also used with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of CRSwNP in adults whose \ndisease is not controlled with their current CRSwNP medicines. Dupixent can also reduce the need for \nsurgery and the need for systemic corticosteroid use. \n \nHow Dupixent works \nUsing Dupixent for atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) can improve the condition of your skin and \nreduce itching. Dupixent has also been shown to improve symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression \nassociated with atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dupixent helps improve your sleep disturbance and \noverall quality of life. \n \n\n\n\n126 \n\nDupixent helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. \nDupixent may also help reduce the amount of another group of medicines you need to control your \nasthma, called oral corticosteroids, while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your \nbreathing. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Dupixent \n \nDo not use Dupixent  \n• if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• if you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for \n\nadvice before using Dupixent. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dupixent: \n \nDupixent is not a rescue medicine and should not be used to treat a sudden asthma attack. \n \nAllergic reactions \n• Very rarely, Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions \n\nand anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. These reactions can occur from minutes until seven \ndays after Dupixent administration. You must look out for signs of these conditions (i.e. breathing \nproblems, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, throat or tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling \nlightheaded (low blood pressure), fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, \njoint pain, skin rash) while you are taking Dupixent.

What Dupixent is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Dupixent is \nDupixent contains the active substance dupilumab. \n \nDupilumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein) that blocks the action of proteins \ncalled IL-4 and IL-13. Both play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of asthma. \n \nWhat Dupixent is used for \nDupixent is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic \ndermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Dupixent is also used to treat children 6 to 11 years old with \nsevere atopic dermatitis. Dupixent may be used with eczema medicines that you apply to the skin or it \nmay be used on its own.  \n \nDupixent is used with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in adults \nand adolescents (12 years of age and older) whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma \nmedicines. \n \nHow Dupixent works \nUsing Dupixent for atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) can improve the condition of your skin and \nreduce itching. Dupixent has also been shown to improve symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression \nassociated with atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dupixent helps improve your sleep disturbance and \noverall quality of life. \n \nDupixent helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. \nDupixent may also help reduce the amount of another group of medicines you need to control your \nasthma, called oral corticosteroids, while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your \nbreathing. \n \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you use Dupixent \n \nDo not use Dupixent  \n• if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• if you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for \n\nadvice before using Dupixent. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dupixent: \n \nDupixent is not a rescue medicine and should not be used to treat a sudden asthma attack. \n \nAllergic reactions \n• Very rarely, Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions \n\nand anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. These reactions can occur from minutes until seven \ndays after Dupixent administration. You must look out for signs of these conditions (i.e. breathing \nproblems, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, throat or tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling \nlightheaded (low blood pressure), fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, \njoint pain, skin rash) while you are taking Dupixent. Such signs are listed under “Serious side \neffects” in section 4. \n\n• Stop using Dupixent and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs \nof an allergic reaction. \n\n \nEosinophilic conditions \n• Rarely patients taking an asthma medicine may develop inflammation of blood vessels or lungs \n\ndue to an increase of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia). \n• It is not known whether this is caused by Dupixent. This usually, but not always, happens in \n\npeople who also take a steroid medicine which is being stopped or for which the dose is being \nlowered. \n\n• Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms such as a flu-like illness, \npins and needles or numbness of arms or legs, worsening of pulmonary symptoms, and/or rash. \n\n \nParasitic (intestinal parasites) infection \n• Dupixent may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a \n\nparasitic infection it should be treated before you start treatment with Dupixent. \n• Check with your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration \n\nwhich could be a sign of a parasitic infection. \n• If you live in a region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region \n\ncheck with your doctor. \n \nAsthma \nIf you have asthma and are taking asthma medicines, do not change or stop your asthma medicine \nwithout talking to your doctor.

What Dupixent is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Dupixent is \nDupixent contains the active substance dupilumab. \n \nDupilumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised protein) that blocks the action of proteins \ncalled IL-4 and IL-13. Both play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of asthma. \n \nWhat Dupixent is used for \nDupixent is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic \ndermatitis, also known as atopic eczema. Dupixent is also used to treat children 6 to 11 years old with \nsevere atopic dermatitis (see section Children and adolescents). Dupixent may be used with eczema \nmedicines that you apply to the skin or it may be used on its own.  \n \nDupixent is used with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in adults \nand adolescents (12 years of age and older) whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma \nmedicines. \n \nHow Dupixent works \nUsing Dupixent for atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) can improve the condition of your skin and \nreduce itching. Dupixent has also been shown to improve symptoms of pain, anxiety, and depression \nassociated with atopic dermatitis. In addition, Dupixent helps improve your sleep disturbance and \noverall quality of life. \n \nDupixent helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. \nDupixent may also help reduce the amount of another group of medicines you need to control your \nasthma, called oral corticosteroids, while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your \nbreathing. \n \n \n\n\n\n156 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Dupixent \n \nDo not use Dupixent  \n• if you are allergic to dupilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• if you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for \n\nadvice before using Dupixent. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Dupixent: \n \nDupixent is not a rescue medicine and should not be used to treat a sudden asthma attack. \n \nAllergic reactions \n• Very rarely, Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions \n\nand anaphylactic reaction and angioedema. These reactions can occur from minutes until seven \ndays after Dupixent administration. You must look out for signs of these conditions (i.e. breathing \nproblems, swelling of the face, lips, mouth, throat or tongue, fainting, dizziness, feeling \nlightheaded (low blood pressure), fever, general ill feeling, swollen lymph nodes, hives, itching, \njoint pain, skin rash) while you are taking Dupixent. Such signs are listed under “Serious side \neffects” in section 4. \n\n• Stop using Dupixent and tell your doctor or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs \nof an allergic reaction. \n\n \nEosinophilic conditions \n• Rarely patients taking an asthma medicine may develop inflammation of blood vessels or lungs \n\ndue to an increase of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia). \n• It is not known whether this is caused by Dupixent. This usually, but not always, happens in \n\npeople who also take a steroid medicine which is being stopped or for which the dose is being \nlowered. \n\n• Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms such as a flu-like illness, \npins and needles or numbness of arms or legs, worsening of pulmonary symptoms, and/or rash. \n\n \nParasitic (intestinal parasites) infection \n• Dupixent may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a \n\nparasitic infection it should be treated before you start treatment with Dupixent. \n• Check with your doctor if you have diarrhoea, gas, upset stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration \n\nwhich could be a sign of a parasitic infection. \n• If you live in a region where these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region \n\ncheck with your doctor. \n \nAsthma \nIf you have asthma and are taking asthma medicines, do not change or stop your asthma medicine \nwithout talking to your doctor. Talk to your doctor before you stop Dupixent or if your asthma remains \nuncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine. \n \nEye problems \nTalk to your doctor if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including eye pain or changes in \nvision. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n\n\n\n157 \n\n• The Dupixent pre-filled pen is not intended for use in children below 12 years of age. For \nchildren aged 6-11 years with atopic dermatitis, contact your doctor who will prescribe the \nappropriate Dupixent pre-filled syringe. \n\n• The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with atopic dermatitis below the \nage of 6. \n\n• The safety and benefits of Dupixent are not yet known in children with asthma below the age of \n12. \n\n \nOther medicines and Dupixent \nTell your doctor or pharmacist  \n• if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n• if you have recently had or are due to have a vaccination. \n\n \nOther medicines for asthma \nDo not stop or reduce your asthma medicines, unless instructed by your doctor. \n• These medicines (especially ones called corticosteroids) must be stopped gradually. \n• This must be done under the direct supervision of your doctor and dependent on your response to \n\nDupixent. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n• If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \n\nadvice before using this medicine. The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known; \ntherefore it is preferable to avoid the use of Dupixent in pregnancy unless your doctor advises to \nuse it. \n\n• If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this \nmedicine. You and your doctor should decide if you will breast-feed or use Dupixent.
