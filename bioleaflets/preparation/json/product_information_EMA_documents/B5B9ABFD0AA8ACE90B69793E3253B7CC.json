This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTecentriq 840 mg concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne 14 mL vial of concentrate contains 840 mg of atezolizumab*. \n \nAfter dilution (see section 6.6), the final concentration of the diluted solution should be between 3.2 \nand 16.8 mg/mL. \n \n*Atezolizumab is an Fc-engineered, humanised IgG1 anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) \nmonoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear, colourless to slightly yellowish liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC): \n• after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy, or \n• who are considered cisplatin ineligible, and whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 5% (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n \nTecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC \nshould also have received targeted therapies before receiving Tecentriq (see section 5.1). \n \nTecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumours have \nPD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTecentriq must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer. \n \nPD-L1 testing for patients with UC or TNBC \n \nPatients with previously untreated UC and TNBC should be selected for treatment based on the \ntumour expression of PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n3 \n \n \n\n \nPosology \n \nTecentriq monotherapy \n \nThe recommended dose of Tecentriq is: \n• 840 mg administered intravenously every two weeks, or \n• 1,680 mg administered intravenously every four weeks.  \n \nTecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel in 1L mTNBC \n \nThe recommended dose of Tecentriq is 840 mg administered by intravenous infusion, followed by \n100 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel. For each 28-day cycle, Tecentriq is administered on days 1 and 15, and \nnab-paclitaxel is administered on days 1, 8, and 15. Refer to the full prescribing information for the \ncombination product (see also section 5.1). \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nIt is recommended that patients are treated with Tecentriq until loss of clinical benefit (see section 5.1) \nor unmanageable toxicity. \nFor TNBC, it is recommended that patients are treated with Tecentriq until disease progression or \nunmanageable toxicity (see section 5.1). \n \nDelayed or missed doses \n \nIf a planned dose of Tecentriq is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. The schedule \nof administration must be adjusted to maintain the appropriate interval between doses.  \n  \nDose modifications during treatment \n \nDose reductions of Tecentriq are not recommended. \n \nDose delay or discontinuation (see also sections 4.4 and 4.8) \n \nTable 1: Dose modification advice for Tecentriq \n \nImmune related adverse \nreaction \n\nSeverity Treatment modification \n\nPneumonitis \n \n\nGrade 2 Withhold Tecentriq \n \nTreatment may be resumed when the \nevent improves to Grade 0 or Grade 1 \nwithin 12 weeks, and corticosteroids \nhave been reduced to ≤ 10 mg \nprednisone or equivalent per day \n\n Grade 3 or 4 Permanently discontinue Tecentriq \n\n\n\n4 \n \n \n\nImmune related adverse \nreaction \n\nSeverity Treatment modification \n\nHepatitis  \n \n\nGrade 2: \n(ALT or AST > 3 to 5 x upper limit of \nnormal [ULN] \n \nor \n \nblood bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN) \n \n\nWithhold Tecentriq \n \nTreatment may be resumed when the \nevent improves to Grade 0 or Grade 1 \nwithin 12 weeks and corticosteroids \nhave been reduced to ≤ 10 mg \nprednisone or equivalent per day \n\nGrade 3 or 4: \n(ALT or AST > 5 x ULN \n \nor \n \nblood bilirubin > 3 x ULN) \n\nPermanently discontinue Tecentriq \n\nColitis \n \n\nGrade 2 or 3 Diarrhoea (increase of ≥ 4 \nstools/day over baseline) \n \nor \n \nSymptomatic Colitis \n\nWithhold Tecentriq  \n \nTreatment may be resumed when the \nevent improves to Grade 0 or Grade 1 \nwithin 12 weeks and corticosteroids \nhave been reduced to ≤ 10 mg \nprednisone or equivalent per day \n\nGrade 4 Diarrhoea or Colitis (life \nthreatening;

Currently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation \non a posology can be made. \n \nElderly \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment of Tecentriq is required in \npatients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild \nor moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment are \ntoo limited to draw conclusions on this population. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required for patients with mild \nhepatic impairment. Tecentriq has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2). \n \nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2 \n \nPatients with ECOG performance status ≥ 2 were excluded from the clinical trials in NSCLC, TNBC \nand 2nd line UC (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nTecentriq is for intravenous use. The infusions must not be administered as an intravenous push or \nbolus. \n \nThe initial dose of Tecentriq must be administered over 60 minutes. If the first infusion is well \ntolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. \n \nFor instructions on dilution and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to atezolizumab or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. \n \nImmune-related adverse reactions \n \nMost immune-related adverse reactions occurring during treatment with atezolizumab were reversible \nwith interruptions of atezolizumab and initiation of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. \nImmune-related adverse reactions affecting more than one body system have been observed. \nImmune-related adverse reactions with atezolizumab may occur after the last dose of atezolizumab. \n \nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, thorough evaluation to confirm aetiology or exclude \nother causes should be performed. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, atezolizumab should \nbe withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid should \nbe tapered over ≥ 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose \nimmune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with systemic corticosteroid use, \nadministration of other systemic immunosuppressants may be considered. \n \nAtezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related adverse reaction \nthat recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-related adverse reactions, except for endocrinopathies that are \ncontrolled with replacement hormones (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nImmune-related pneumonitis  \n \nCases of pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab \n(see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and causes \nother than immune-related pneumonitis should be ruled out. \n. \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 pneumonitis, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nprednisone or equivalent should be started. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should \nbe tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to \n≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or \nequivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 \npneumonitis. \n \nImmune-related hepatitis  \n \nCases of hepatitis, some leading to fatal outcomes have been observed in clinical trials with \natezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis. \n \nAspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin should be monitored \nprior to initiation of treatment, periodically during treatment with atezolizumab and as indicated based \non clinical evaluation. \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld if Grade 2 event (ALT or AST > 3 to 5 x ULN or \nblood bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN) persists for more than 5 to 7 days, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of \nprednisone or equivalent should be started. If the event improves to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should \nbe tapered over ≥ 1 month.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n \n\nTreatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and \ncorticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with \natezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 events (ALT or AST \n> 5.0 x ULN or blood bilirubin > 3 x ULN). \n \nImmune-related colitis \n \nCases of diarrhoea or colitis have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis.  \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 3 diarrhoea (increase of ≥ 4 stools/day \nover baseline) or colitis (symptomatic). For Grade 2 diarrhoea or colitis, if symptoms persist > 5 days \nor recur, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be started. For \nGrade 3 diarrhoea or colitis, treatment with intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, treatment with \n1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, \ncorticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the \nevent improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg \nprednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for \nGrade 4 (life threatening; urgent intervention indicated) diarrhoea or colitis. \n \nImmune-related endocrinopathies  \n \nHypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, \nincluding diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section \n4.8).  \n \nPatients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies. Thyroid function \nshould be monitored prior to and periodically during treatment with atezolizumab. Appropriate \nmanagement of patients with abnormal thyroid function tests at baseline should be considered. \n \nAsymptomatic patients with abnormal thyroid function tests can receive atezolizumab. For \nsymptomatic hypothyroidism, atezolizumab should be withheld and thyroid hormone replacement \nshould be initiated as needed. Isolated hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy and \nwithout corticosteroids. For symptomatic hyperthyroidism, atezolizumab should be withheld and an \nanti-thyroid medicinal product should be initiated as needed. Treatment with atezolizumab may be \nresumed when symptoms are controlled and thyroid function is improving. \n \nFor symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, atezolizumab should be withheld and treatment with \nintravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. \nOnce symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should follow. \nIf symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment may \nbe resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced \nto ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day and the patient is stable on replacement therapy (if \nrequired). \n \nFor Grade 2 or Grade 3 hypophysitis, atezolizumab should be withheld and treatment with intravenous \ncorticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started, and hormone \nreplacement should be initiated as needed. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nof prednisone or equivalent should follow. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should \nbe tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within \n12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day and the \npatient is stable on replacement therapy (if required). Treatment with atezolizumab should be \npermanently discontinued for Grade 4 hypophysitis. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n \n\nTreatment with insulin should be initiated for type 1 diabetes mellitus. For ≥ Grade 3 hyperglycaemia \n(fasting glucose > 250 mg/dL or 13.9 mmol/L), atezolizumab should be withheld. Treatment with \natezolizumab may be resumed if metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement therapy. \n \nImmune-related meningoencephalitis  \n \nMeningoencephalitis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any grade of meningitis or \nencephalitis. Treatment with intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or \nequivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone \nor equivalent should follow.  \n \nImmune-related neuropathies \n \nMyasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome, which may be life threatening, \nwere observed in patients receiving atezolizumab. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of \nmotor and sensory neuropathy.  \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any grade of myasthenic \nsyndrome / myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids (at a \ndose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) should be considered. \n \nImmune-related pancreatitis \n \nPancreatitis, including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, has been observed in clinical \ntrials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms that are suggestive of acute pancreatitis. \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for ≥ Grade 3 serum amylase or lipase levels \nincreased (> 2 x ULN), or Grade 2 or 3 pancreatitis, and treatment with intravenous corticosteroids  \n(1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, \ntreatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should follow. Treatment with \natezolizumab may be resumed when serum amylase and lipase levels improve to ≤ Grade 1 within \n12 weeks, or symptoms of pancreatitis have resolved, and corticosteroids have been reduced to \n≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be permanently \ndiscontinued for Grade 4, or any grade of recurrent pancreatitis. \n \nImmune-related myocarditis \n \nMyocarditis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of myocarditis.  \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 myocarditis, and treatment with systemic \ncorticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. Treatment \nwith atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and \ncorticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with \natezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 myocarditis. \n \nImmune-related nephritis \n \nNephritis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for changes in renal function.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n \n\nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 nephritis, and treatment with systemic \ncorticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. Treatment \nwith atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and \ncorticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with \natezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. \n \nImmune-related myositis  \n \nCases of myositis, including fatal cases, have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myositis.  \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 3 myositis and corticosteroid therapy \n(1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) should be initiated. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, taper \ncorticosteroids as clinically indicated. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event \nimproves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg oral \nprednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued \nfor Grade 4 or grade 3 recurrent myositis, or when unable to reduce the corticosteroid dose to the \nequivalent of ≤ 10 mg prednisone per day within 12 weeks after onset. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8).  \n \nThe rate of infusion should be reduced or treatment should be interrupted in patients with Grade 1 or 2 \ninfusion-related reactions. Atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients with Grade 3 \nor 4 infusion-related reactions. Patients with Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions may continue to \nreceive atezolizumab with close monitoring; premedication with antipyretic and antihistamines may be \nconsidered.  \n \nDisease-specific precautions \n \nUse of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in metastatic non \nsquamous non small cell lung cancer  \n \nPhysicians should carefully consider the combined risks of the four-drug regimen of atezolizumab \nbevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin before initiating treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nUse of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel in metastatic triple negative breast cancer \n \nNeutropenia and peripheral neuropathies occurring during treatment with atezolizumab and nab-\npaclitaxel may be reversible with interruptions of nab-paclitaxel. Physicians should consult the nab-\npaclitaxel summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for specific precautions and contraindications \nof this medicine. \n \nPatients excluded from clinical trials \n \nPatients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical trials: a history of autoimmune \ndisease, history of pneumonitis, active brain metastasis, HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, \nsignificant cardiovascular disease and patients with inadequate hematologic and end-organ function. \nPatients who were administered a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to enrolment; systemic \nimmunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within \n2 weeks prior to study entry were excluded from clinical trials.  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n \n\nUse of atezolizumab in urothelial carcinoma for previously untreated patients who are considered \ncisplatin ineligible \n \nThe baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the IMvigor210 Cohort 1 study population were \noverall comparable to patients in the clinic who would be considered cisplatin ineligible but would be \neligible for a carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy. There are insufficient data for the \nsubgroup of patients that would be unfit for any chemotherapy; therefore atezolizumab should be used \nwith caution in these patients, after careful consideration of the potential balance of risks and benefits \non an individual basis. \n \nUse of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin  \n \nPatients with NSCLC that had clear tumour infiltration into the thoracic great vessels or clear \ncavitation of pulmonary lesions, as seen on imaging, were excluded from the pivotal clinical study \nIMpower150 after several cases of fatal pulmonary haemorrhage were observed, which is a known \nrisk factor of treatment with bevacizumab.  \n \nIn the absence of data, atezolizumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful \nevaluation of the balance of benefits and risks for the patient. \n \nUse of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in EGFR+ patients \nwith NSCLC who have progressed on erlotinib+bevacizumab \n \nIn study IMpower150, there are no data on the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with \nbevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in EGFR+ patients who have progressed previously on \nerlotinib+bevacizumab.  \n \nPatient alert card \n \nAll prescribers of Tecentriq must be familiar with the Physician Information and Management \nGuidelines. The prescriber must discuss the risks of Tecentriq therapy with the patient. The patient \nwill be provided with the patient alert card and instructed to carry the card at all times. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with atezolizumab. Since \natezolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug interactions \nare expected.  \n \nThe use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting atezolizumab should be \navoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of \natezolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used to treat \nimmune-related adverse reactions after starting atezolizumab (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for 5 months after \ntreatment with atezolizumab. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of atezolizumab in pregnant women. No developmental and \nreproductive studies were conducted with atezolizumab. Animal studies have demonstrated that \ninhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in murine pregnancy models can lead to immune-related \n\n\n\n12 \n \n \n\nrejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death (see section 5.3). These results indicate a \npotential risk, based on its mechanism of action, that administration of atezolizumab during pregnancy \ncould cause foetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth.  \n \nHuman immunoglobulins G1 (IgG1) are known to cross the placental barrier and atezolizumab is an \nIgG1; therefore, atezolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing \nfoetus.  \n \nAtezolizumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman \nrequires treatment with atezolizumab. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether atezolizumab is excreted in human milk. Atezolizumab is a monoclonal \nantibody and is expected to be present in the first milk and at low levels afterwards. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue Tecentriq therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and \nthe benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo clinical data are available on the possible effects of atezolizumab on fertility. No reproductive and \ndevelopment toxicity studies have been conducted with atezolizumab; however, based on the 26-week \nrepeat dose toxicity study, atezolizumab had an effect on menstrual cycles at an estimated AUC \napproximately 6 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose and was reversible (see \nsection 5.3). There were no effects on the male reproductive organs. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTecentriq has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing fatigue \nshould be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of atezolizumab as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 3,178 patients across multiple \ntumour types. The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) were fatigue (35.9%), decreased appetite \n(25.5%), nausea (23.5%), cough (20.8%), dyspnoea (20.5%), pyrexia (20.1%), diarrhoea (19.7%), rash \n(19.5%), musculoskeletal pain (15.4%), back pain (15.3%), vomiting (15.0%), asthenia (14.5%), \narthralgia (13.9%), pruritus (12.6%) and urinary tract infection (11.6%). \n \nThe safety of atezolizumab given in combination with other medicinal products, has been evaluated in \n3,878 patients across multiple tumour types. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were \nanaemia (40.3%), neutropenia (39.4%), nausea (37.3%), fatigue (34.4%), alopecia (29.6%), \nthrombocytopenia (28.9%), diarrhoea (28.1%), rash (27.7%), constipation (27.2%), peripheral \nneuropathy (25.7%),and decreased appetite (25.5%). \n \nFor the description of Tecentriq trials, refer to the Tecentriq 1,200 mg concentrate for solution for \ninfusion Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) section 5.1. \n \nFurther details on serious adverse reactions are provided in Section 4.4 Warnings & Precautions. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and categories \nof frequency in Table 2 for atezolizumab given as monotherapy or as combination therapy. Adverse \nreactions known to occur with atezolizumab or chemotherapies given alone may occur during \ntreatment with these medicinal products in combination, even if these reactions were not reported in \nclinical trials with combination therapy. The following categories of frequency have been used: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \nthe order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2: Summary of adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with atezolizumab \n

Pancreatitis \nrequiring the use of corticosteroids occurred in 0.1% (4/3,178) of patients receiving atezolizumab \nmonotherapy. \n \nImmune-related myocarditis  \n \nMyocarditis occurred in < 0.1% (2/8,000) of patients across all atezolizumab clinical trials in multiple \ntumour types and treatment combinations. The time to onset was 18 and 33 days. Both patients \nrequired corticosteroids and discontinued atezolizumab.  \n \nImmune-related nephritis \n \nNephritis occurred in < 0.1% (3/3,178) of patients who received atezolizumab. The median time to \nonset was 13.1 months (range: 9.0 to 17.5 months). The median duration was 2.8 months (range 15 \ndays to 9.5+ months; + denotes a censored value). Nephritis led to discontinuation of atezolizumab in \n2 (<0.1%) patients. One patient required corticosteroids and discontinued atezolizumab. \n \nImmune-related myositis \n \nMyositis occurred in 0.4% (12/3178) of patients who received atezolizumab monotherapy. The median \ntime to onset was 5.4 months (range: 0.7 to 11.0 months). The median duration was 3.5 months (range \n\n\n\n18 \n \n \n\n0.1 to 22.6+ months; + denotes a censored value). Myositis led to discontinuation of atezolizumab in 1 \n(<0.1%) patient. Seven (0.2%) patients required the use of corticosteroids.  \n \nUse of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin  \n \nIn the first-line NSCLC study (IMpower150), an overall higher frequency of adverse events was \nobserved in the four-drug regimen of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin \ncompared to atezolizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, including Grade 3 and 4 events (63.6% \ncompared to 57.5%), Grade 5 events (6.1% compared to 2.5%), adverse events of special interest to \natezolizumab (52.4% compared to 48.0%), as well as adverse events leading to withdrawal of any \nstudy treatment (33.8% compared to 13.3%). Nausea, diarrhoea, stomatitis, fatigue, pyrexia, mucosal \ninflammation, decreased appetite, weight decreased, hypertension and proteinuria were reported \nhigher (≥5% difference) in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, \npaclitaxel and carboplatin. Other clinically significant adverse events which were observed more \nfrequently in the atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm were epistaxis, \nhaemoptysis, cerebrovascular accident, including fatal events. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAcross multiple phase III studies, 13.1% to 36.4% of patients developed treatment-emergent anti-drug \nantibodies (ADAs).  \n \nAcross pooled datasets for patients treated with atezolizumab monotherapy (N=2705) and with \ncombination therapies (N=1811), the following rates of adverse events (AEs) have been observed for \nthe ADA-positive population compared to the ADA-negative population, respectively: Grade 3-4 AEs \n49.1% vs. 44.3%,  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 42.4% vs. 37.6%, AEs leading to treatment \nwithdrawal 6.1% vs 6.7% (for monotherapy); Grade 3-4 AEs 65.3% vs. 63.6%, SAEs 42.1% vs. \n36.6%, AEs leading to treatment withdrawal 24.3% vs 19.5% (for combination therapy). However, \navailable data do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn on possible patterns of adverse drug reactions.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety of atezolizumab in children and adolescents has not been established. No new safety signals \nwere observed in a clinical study with 69 paediatric patients (<18 years) and the safety profile was \ncomparable to adults. \n \nElderly patients \n \nNo overall differences in safety were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and younger \npatients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy. In study IMpower150, age ≥ 65 was associated with an \nincreased risk of developing adverse events in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with \nbevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel. \n \nIn studies IMpower150 and IMpower133, data for patients ≥75 years of age are too limited to draw \nconclusions on this population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n19 \n \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no information on overdose with atezolizumab.  \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, \nand appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC32 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) may be expressed on tumour cells and/or tumour-infiltrating \nimmune cells, and can contribute to the inhibition of the antitumour immune response in the tumour \nmicroenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T-cells and antigen \npresenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.  \n \nAtezolizumab is an Fc-engineered, humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that \ndirectly binds to PD-L1 and provides a dual blockade of the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors, releasing \nPD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response, including reactivating the antitumour \nimmune response without inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Atezolizumab spares the \nPD-L2/PD-1 interaction allowing PD-L2/PD-1 mediated inhibitory signals to persist.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nFor the description of studies with Tecentriq administered every 3 weeks at 1,200 mg, refer to the \nTecentriq 1,200 mg concentrate for solution for infusion SmPC. \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab until loss of clinical benefit was permitted as defined by the following \ncriteria: \n• Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values [e.g., new or \n\nworsening hypercalcaemia]) indicating unequivocal progression of disease \n• No decline in ECOG performance status  \n• Absence of tumour progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that \n\ncannot be readily managed and stabilised by protocol-allowed medical interventions prior to \nrepeat dosing \n\n• Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator \n \nPatients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who are ineligible for cisplatin therapy and locally \nadvanced unresectable or metastatic TNBC were treated with atezolizumab until disease progression. \n \nUrothelial carcinoma \n \nIMvigor211 (GO29294): Randomised trial in locally advanced or metastatic UC patients previously \ntreated with chemotherapy \n \nA phase III, open-label, multi-center, international, randomised study, (IMvigor211), was conducted to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy (investigator’s choice \nof vinflunine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who \nprogressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. This study excluded patients who had \n\n\n\n20 \n \n \n\na history of autoimmune disease; active or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases; administration \nof a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to enrolment; and administration of systemic \nimmunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal product within \n2 weeks prior to enrolment. Tumour assessments were conducted every 9 weeks for the first 54 weeks, \nand every 12 weeks thereafter. Tumour specimens were evaluated prospectively for PD-L1 expression \non tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) and the results were used to define the PD-L1 expression \nsubgroups for the analyses described below.  \n \nA total of 931 patients were enrolled. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either atezolizumab or \nchemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by chemotherapy (vinflunine vs. taxane), PD-L1 \nexpression status on IC (< 5% vs. ≥ 5%), number of prognostic risk factors (0 vs. 1-3), and liver \nmetastases (yes vs. no). Prognostic risk factors included time from prior chemotherapy of < 3 months, \nECOG performance status > 0 and haemoglobin < 10 g/dL. \n \nAtezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1,200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. \nNo dose reduction of atezolizumab was allowed. Patients were treated until loss of clinical benefit as \nassessed by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity. Vinflunine was administered 320 mg/m2 by \nintravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \nPaclitaxel was administered 175 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 3 hours on day 1 of each 3-week \ncycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Docetaxel was administered 75 mg/m2 by \nintravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \nFor all treated patients, the median duration of treatment was 2.8 months for the atezolizumab arm, \n2.1 months for the vinflunine and paclitaxel arms and 1.6 months for the docetaxel arm. \n \nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the primary analysis population were well \nbalanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 67 years (range: 31 to 88), and 77.1% of \npatients were male. The majority of patients were white (72.1%), 53.9% of patients within the \nchemotherapy arm received vinflunine, 71.4% of patients had at least one poor prognostic risk factor \nand 28.8% had liver metastases at baseline. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (45.6%) or 1 \n(54.4%). Bladder was the primary tumour site for 71.1% of patients and 25.4% of patients had upper \ntract urothelial carcinoma. There were 24.2% of patients who received only prior platinum-containing \nadjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy and progressed within 12 months. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint for IMvigor211 is overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy endpoints \nevaluated per investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 are \nobjective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR). \nComparisons with respect to OS between the treatment arm and control arm within the IC2/3, IC1/2/3, \nand ITT (Intention-to-treat, i.e. all comers) populations were tested using a hierarchical fixed-sequence \nprocedure based on a stratified log-rank test at two-sided level of 5% as follows: step 1) IC2/3 \npopulation; step 2) IC1/2/3 population; step 3) all comers population. OS results for each of steps 2 \nand 3 could be formally tested for statistical significance only if the result in the preceding step was \nstatistically significant. \n \nThe median survival follow-up is 17 months. The primary analysis of study IMvigor211 did not meet \nits primary endpoint of OS. Atezolizumab did not demonstrate a statistically significant survival \nbenefit compared to chemotherapy in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic \nurothelial carcinoma. Per the pre-specified hierarchical testing order, the IC2/3 population was tested \nfirst, with an OS HR of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.21; median OS of 11.1 vs. 10.6 months for atezolizumab \nand chemotherapy respectively). The stratified log-rank p-value was 0.41 and therefore the results are \nconsidered not statistically significant in this population. As a consequence, no formal tests of \nstatistical significance could be performed for OS in the IC1/2/3 or all comer populations, and results \nof those analyses would be considered exploratory. The key results in the all comer population are \nsummarised in Table 3. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS in the all comer population is presented in \nFigure 1. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n \n\nAn exploratory updated survival analysis was performed with a median duration of survival follow up \nof 34 months in the ITT population. The median OS was 8.6 months (95% CI: 7.8, 9.6) in the \natezolizumab arm and 8.0 months (95% CI: 7.2, 8.6) in the chemotherapy arm with a hazard ratio of \n0.82 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.94). Consistent with the trend observed at primary analysis for 12-month OS \nrates, numerically higher 24-month and 30-month OS rates were observed for patients in the \natezolizumab arm compared with the chemotherapy arm in the ITT population. The percentage of \npatients alive at 24 months (KM estimate) was 12.7% in the chemotherapy arm and 22.5% in the \natezolizumab arm; and at 30 months (KM estimate) was 9.8% in the chemotherapy arm and 18.1% in \nthe atezolizumab arm. \n \nTable 3: Summary of efficacy in all comers (IMvigor211) \n \n\nEfficacy endpoint \nAtezolizumab \n\n(n = 467) \nChemotherapy \n\n(n = 464) \nPrimary efficacy endpoint \nOS* \n   No. of deaths (%) 324 (69.4%) 350 (75.4%) \n   Median time to events (months)  8.6 8.0 \n   95% CI 7.8, 9.6 7.2, 8.6 \n\n   Stratifiedǂ hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.85 (0.73, 0.99) \n\n12-month OS (%)** 39.2% 32.4% \n\nSecondary and exploratory endpoints \nInvestigator-assessed PFS (RECIST v1.1) \n   No. of events (%) 407 (87.2%) 410 (88.4%) \n   Median duration of PFS (months) 2.1 4.0 \n   95% CI 2.1, 2.2 3.4, 4.2 \n   Stratified hazard ratio (95% CI) 1.10 (0.95, 1.26) \nInvestigator-assessed ORR (RECIST v1.1) n = 462 n = 461 \n   No. of confirmed responders (%) 62 (13.4%) 62 (13.4%) \n   95% CI 10.45, 16.87 10.47, 16.91 \nNo. of complete response (%) 16 (3.5%) 16 (3.5%) \nNo. of partial response (%) 46 (10.0%) 46 (10.0%) \nNo. of stable disease (%) 92 (19.9%) 162 (35.1%) \nInvestigator-assessed DOR (RECIST v1.1) n = 62 n = 62 \n   Median in months *** 21.7 7.4 \n   95% CI 13.0, 21.7 6.1, 10.3 \nCI = confidence interval; DOR = duration of response; ORR = objective response rate; OS = overall survival; \nPFS = progression-free survival; RECIST = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours v1.1. \n* An analysis of OS in the all comer population was performed based on the stratified log-rank test and the result \nis provided for descriptive purposes only (p = 0.0378); according to the pre-specified analysis hierarchy, the \np-value for the OS analysis in the all comer population cannot be considered statistically significant. \nǂ Stratified by chemotherapy (vinflunine vs. taxane), status on IC (< 5% vs. ≥ 5%), number of prognostic risk \nfactors (0 vs. 1-3), and liver metastases (yes vs. no). \n** Based on Kaplan-Meier estimate \n*** Responses were ongoing in 63% of responders in the atezolizumab arm and in 21% of responders in the \nchemotherapy arm. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival (IMvigor211) \n \n\n \n \nIMvigor210 (GO29293): Single-arm trial in previously untreated urothelial carcinoma patients who \nare ineligible for cisplatin therapy and in urothelial carcinoma patients previously treated with \nchemotherapy \n \nA phase II, multi-centre, international, two-cohort, single-arm clinical trial, IMvigor210, was \nconducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC (also known as urothelial bladder \ncancer).  \n \nThe study enrolled a total of 438 patients and had two patient cohorts. Cohort 1 included previously \nuntreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who were ineligible or unfit for \ncisplatin-based chemotherapy or had disease progression at least 12 months after treatment with a \nplatinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Cohort 2 included patients who \nreceived at least one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic UC or \nhad disease progression within 12 months of treatment with a platinum-containing neoadjuvant or \nadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. \n \nIn Cohort 1, 119 patients were treated with atezolizumab 1,200 mg by intravenous infusion every \n3 weeks until disease progression. The median age was 73 years. Most patients were male (81%), and \nthe majority of patients were White (91%).  \n \nCohort 1 included 45 patients (38%) with ECOG performance status of 0, 50 patients (42%) with \nECOG performance status of 1 and 24 patients (20%) with ECOG performance status of 2, 35 patients \n(29%) with no Bajorin risk factors (ECOG performance status ≥ 2 and visceral metastasis), 66 patients \n(56%) with one Bajorin risk factor and 18 patients (15 %) with two Bajorin risk factors, 84 patients \n(71%) with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min), and 25 patients \n(21%) with liver metastasis. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n \n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint for Cohort 1 was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) as assessed \nby an independent review facility (IRF) using RECIST v1.1.  \nThe primary analysis was performed when all patients had at least 24 weeks of follow-up. Median \nduration of treatment was 15.0 weeks and median duration of survival follow-up was 8.5 months in all \ncomers. Clinically relevant IRF-assessed ORRs per RECIST v1.1 were shown; however, when \ncompared to a pre-specified historical control response rate of 10%, statistical significance was not \nreached for the primary endpoint. The confirmed ORRs per IRF-RECIST v1.1 were 21.9% (95% CI: \n9.3, 40.0) in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%, 18.8% (95% CI: 10.9, 29.0) in patients with PD-L1 \nexpression ≥ 1%, and 19.3% (95% CI: 12.7, 27.6) in all comers. The median duration of response \n(DOR) was not reached in any PD-L1 expression subgroup or in all comers. OS was not mature with \nan event patient ratio of approximately 40%.

For Cohort 2, median DOR was not reached in any PD-L1 expression subgroup or in all \ncomers, however was reached in patients with PD-L1 expression < 1% (13.3 months; 95% CI 4.2, NE). \nThe OS rate at 12 month was 37% in all comers.  \n \nIMvigor130 (WO30070): Phase III multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study of \natezolizumab as monotherapy and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with \nuntreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma \n \nBased on an independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) recommendation following an early \nreview of survival data, accrual of patients on the atezolizumab monotherapy treatment arm whose \ntumours have a low PD-L1 expression (less than 5% of immune cells staining positive for PD-L1 by \nimmunohistochemistry) was stopped after observing decreased overall survival for this subgroup. The \niDMC did not recommend any change of therapy for patients who had already been randomized to and \nwere receiving treatment in the monotherapy arm. No other changes were recommended. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer  \n \nSecond-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer \n \nOAK (GO28915): Randomised phase III trial in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients \npreviously treated with chemotherapy \n \nA phase III, open-label, multi-center, international, randomised study, OAK, was conducted to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. \nThis study excluded patients who had a history of autoimmune disease, active or \ncorticosteroid-dependent brain metastases, administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days \nprior to enrolment, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic \nimmunosuppressive medicinal product within 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Tumour assessments were \nconducted every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter. Tumour specimens were \nevaluated prospectively for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) and tumour-infiltrating immune \ncells (IC). \n \nA total of 1,225 patients were enrolled and per the analysis plan the first 850 randomised patients were \nincluded in the primary efficacy analysis. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression status on \nIC, by the number of prior chemotherapy regimens, and by histology. Patients were randomised (1:1) \nto receive either atezolizumab or docetaxel. \n \nAtezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1,200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. \nNo dose reduction was allowed. Patients were treated until loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the \ninvestigator. Docetaxel was administered 75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week \ncycle until disease progression. For all treated patients, the median duration of treatment was \n2.1 months for the docetaxel arm and 3.4 months for the atezolizumab arm.  \n \nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the primary analysis population were well \nbalanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range: 33 to 85), and 61% of \npatients were male. The majority of patients were white (70%). Approximately three-quarters of \npatients had non-squamous histology (74%), 10% had known EGFR mutation, 0.2% had known ALK \nrearrangements, 10% had CNS metastases at baseline, and most patients were current or previous \n\n\n\n25 \n \n \n\nsmokers (82%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (37%) or 1 (63%). Seventy five percent of \npatients received only one prior platinum-based therapeutic regimen. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was OS. The key results of this study with a median survival follow-up \nof 21 months are summarised in Table 5. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS in the ITT population are \npresented in Figure 2. Figure 3 summarises the results of OS in the ITT and PD-L1 subgroups, \ndemonstrating OS benefit with atezolizumab in all subgroups, including those with PD-L1 \nexpression < 1% in TC and IC.  \n \nTable 5: Summary of efficacy in the primary analysis population (all comers)* (OAK) \n \n\nEfficacy endpoint \nAtezolizumab \n\n(n = 425) \nDocetaxel \n(n = 425) \n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint \nOS  \n   No. of deaths (%) 271 (64%) 298 (70%) \n   Median time to events (months)  13.8 9.6 \n   95% CI (11.8, 15.7) (8.6, 11.2) \n\n   Stratifiedǂ hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.73 (0.62, 0.87) \n\n   p-value** 0.0003 \n12-month OS (%)*** 218 (55%) 151 (41%) \n18-month OS (%)*** 157 (40%) 98 (27%) \n\nSecondary endpoints \nInvestigator-assessed PFS (RECIST v1.1) \n   No. of events (%) 380 (89%) 375 (88%) \n   Median duration of PFS (months) 2.8 4.0 \n   95% CI (2.6, 3.0) (3.3, 4.2) \n   Stratified hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.95 (0.82, 1.10) \nInvestigator-assessed ORR (RECIST v1.1) \n   No. of responders (%) 58 (14%) 57 (13%) \n   95% CI (10.5, 17.3) (10.3, 17.0) \nInvestigator-assessed DOR (RECIST v1.1) n = 58 n = 57 \n   Median in months 16.3 6.2 \n   95% CI (10.0, NE) (4.9, 7.6) \nCI = confidence interval; DOR = duration of response; NE = not estimable; ORR = objective response rate; \nOS = overall survival; PFS = progression-free survival; RECIST = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \nTumours v1.1. \n*The primary analysis population consists of the first 850 randomised patients \nǂStratified by PD-L1 expression in tumour infiltrating immune cells, the number of prior chemotherapy \nregimens, and histology \n** Based on the stratified log-rank test \n*** Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates \n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n \n\nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival in the primary analysis population (all \ncomers) (OAK) \n \n\n \n \nFigure 3: Forest plot of overall survival by PD-L1 expression in the primary analysis population \n(OAK) \n \n\n \n \n\naStratified HR for ITT and TC or IC ≥ 1%. Unstratified HR for other exploratory subgroups. \n \nAn improvement in OS was observed with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel in both non-squamous \nNSCLC patients (hazard ratio [HR] of 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89; median OS of 15.6 vs. 11.2 months \nfor atezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively) and squamous NSCLC patients (HR of 0.73, \n95% CI: 0.54, 0.98; median OS of 8.9 vs. 7.7 months for atezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively). \nThe observed OS improvement was consistently demonstrated across subgroups of patients including \nthose with brain metastases at baseline (HR of 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.94; median OS of 20.1 \nvs. 11.9 months for atezolizumab and docetaxel respectively) and patients who were never smokers \n(HR of 0.71, 95% CI: 0.47, 1.08; median OS of 16.3 vs. 12.6 months for atezolizumab and docetaxel, \n\n\n\n27 \n \n \n\nrespectively). However, patients with EGFR mutations did not show improved OS with atezolizumab \ncompared to docetaxel (HR of 1.24, 95% CI: 0.71, 2.18; median OS of 10.5 vs. 16.2 months for \natezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively).  \n \nProlonged time to deterioration of patient-reported pain in chest as measured by the EORTC \nQLQ-LC13 was observed with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel (HR of 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49, 1.05; \nmedian not reached in either arm). The time to deterioration in other lung cancer symptoms (i.e. cough, \ndyspnoea, and arm/shoulder pain) as measured by the EORTC QLQ-LC13 was similar between \natezolizumab and docetaxel. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the open-label \ndesign of the study. \n \nPOPLAR (GO28753): Randomised phase II trial in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients \npreviously treated with chemotherapy \n \nA phase II, multi-centre, international, randomised, open-label, controlled study, POPLAR, was \nconducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or following \na platinum-containing regimen, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The primary efficacy outcome was \noverall survival. A total of 287 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either atezolizumab (1,200 mg \nby intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until loss of clinical benefit) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 by \nintravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression). Randomisation was \nstratified by PD-L1 expression status on IC, by the number of prior chemotherapy regimens and by \nhistology. An updated analysis with a total of 200 deaths observed and a median survival follow-up of \n22 months showed a median OS of 12.6 months in patients treated with atezolizumab, vs. 9.7 months \nin patients treated with docetaxel (HR of 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.92). ORR was 15.3% vs. 14.7% and \nmedian DOR was 18.6 months vs. 7.2 months for atezolizumab vs. docetaxel, respectively.  \n \nTriple-negative breast cancer \n \nIMpassion130 (WO29522): Randomised phase III trial in locally advanced or metastatic TNBC \npatients previously untreated for metastatic disease  \n \nA phase III, double-blind, two-arm, multi-center, international, randomised, placebo-controlled study, \nIMpassion130, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with \nnab-paclitaxel, in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who had not \nreceived prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients had to be eligible for taxane monotherapy \n(i.e. absence of rapid clinical progression, life-threatening visceral metastases, or need for rapid \nsymptom and/or disease control) and were excluded if they had received prior chemotherapy in the \nneoadjuvant or adjuvant setting within the last 12 months, a history of autoimmune disease; \nadministration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomisation, administration of \nsystemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications \nwithin 2 weeks prior to randomisation; untreated, symptomatic or corticosteroid-dependent brain \nmetastases. Tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 12 months \nafter Cycle 1, day 1 and every 12 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter. \n \nA total of 902 patients were enrolled and stratified by presence of liver metastases, prior taxane \ntreatment, and by PD-L1 expression status in tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) (PD-L1 stained \ntumour-infiltrating immune cells [IC] <1% of tumour area vs. ≥ 1% of the tumour area) assessed by \nthe VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay. \n \nPatients were randomised to receive atezolizumab 840 mg or placebo by intravenous infusions on \ndays 1 and 15 of every 28-day cycle, plus nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2) administered via intravenous \ninfusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Patients received treatment until radiographic \ndisease progression per RECIST v1.1, or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with atezolizumab could be \ncontinued when nab-paclitaxel was stopped due to unacceptable toxicity. The median number of \ntreatment cycles was 7 for atezolizumab and 6 for nab-paclitaxel in each treatment arm. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n \n\nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced \nbetween the treatment arms. Most patients were women (99.6%), 67.5% were white and 17.8% Asian. \nThe median age was 55 years (range: 20-86). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (58.4%) \nor 1 (41.3%). Overall, 41% of enrolled patients had PD-L1 expression ≥1%, 27% had liver metastases \nand 7% asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline. Approximately half the patients had received a \ntaxane (51%) or anthracycline (54%) in the (neo)adjuvant setting. Patient demographics and baseline \ntumour disease in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1% were generally representative of the broader \nstudy population. \n \nThe co-primary efficacy endpoints included investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) in \nthe ITT population and in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% per RECIST v1.1 as well as overall \nsurvival (OS) in the ITT population and in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. Secondary efficacy \nendpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1.  \n \nPFS, ORR and DOR results of IMpassion130 for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% at the time of \nthe final analysis for PFS with a median survival follow up of 13 months are summarized in Table 6 \nwith Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS in Figure 4.  Patients with PD-L1 expression <1% did not show \nimproved PFS when atezolizumab was added to nab-paclitaxel (HR of 0.94, 95% CI 0.78, 1.13). \n \nAn updated OS analysis was performed with a median follow up of 18 months, OS results are \npresented in Table 6 and Kaplan-Meier curves in Figure 5. Patients with PD-L1 expression <1% did \nnot show improved OS when atezolizumab was added to nab-paclitaxel (HR of 0.97, 95% CI 0.78, \n1.20). At the time of the updated OS analysis, an exploratory PFS analysis was performed as presented \nin Table 6. \n \nExploratory subgroup analyses were performed in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, exploring \nprior (neo)adjuvant treatment, BRCA1/2 mutation and asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline.  \n \nIn patients who had received prior (neo) adjuvant treatment (n=242), the hazard ratio for PFS was 0.79 \nand 0.82 for OS while in patients who had not received prior (neo)adjuvant treatment (n=127), the \nhazard ratio for PFS was 0.44 and 0.53 for OS.  \n \nIn the IMpassion130 study, of the 614 patients tested, 89 (15%) carried pathogenic BRCA1/2 \nmutations. From the PD-L1+/BRCA1/2 mutant subgroup, 19 patients received atezolizumab plus nab-\npaclitaxel and 26 placebo plus nab-paclitaxel. Based on exploratory analysis and acknowledging the \nsmall sample size, the presence of BRCA1/2 mutation does not seem to impact the PFS clinical benefit \nof atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel. \n \nThere was no evidence of efficacy in patients with asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline, \nalthough the number of patients treated was small; the median PFS was 2.2 months in the \natezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel arm (n=15) compared to 5.6 months in the placebo plus nab-\npaclitaxel arm (n=11) (HR 1.40; 95% CI 0.57, 3.44).  \n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n \n\nTable 6 - Summary of efficacy in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1% (IMpassion130) \n \n\nKey efficacy endpoints Atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel Placebo + nab-paclitaxel \n\nPrimary efficacy endpoints n=185 n=184 \n\nInvestigator-assessed PFS (RECIST v1.1) – Primary analysis3   \nNo. of events (%) 138 (74.6%) 157 (85.3%) \n\nMedian duration of PFS (months) 7.5 5.0 \n\n95% CI (6.7, 9.2) (3.8, 5.6) \n\n Stratified hazard ratio‡ (95% CI) 0.62 (0.49, 0.78) \n\n p-value1  <0.0001 \n 12-month PFS (%) 29.1 16.4 \n\nInvestigator-assessed PFS (RECIST v1.1) – Updated exploratory analysis4 \nNo. of events (%) 149 (80.5%) 163 (88.6%) \n\nMedian duration of PFS (months) 7.5 5.3 \n\n95% CI (6.7, 9.2) (3.8, 5.6) \n\n Stratified hazard ratio‡ (95% CI) 0.63 (0.50-0.80) \n\n p-value1  <0.0001 \n 12-month PFS (%) 30.3 17.3 \n\nOS1,2,4    \n\nNo. of deaths (%) 94 (50.8%)  110 (59.8%) \nMedian time to events (months) 25.0 18.0 \n\n95% CI (19.55, 30.65) (13.63, 20.07) \n\nStratified hazard ratio‡ (95% CI) 0.71 (0.54, 0.93) \n\nSecondary and exploratory endpoints \n\nInvestigator-assessed ORR (RECIST 1.1)3 n=185 n=183 \nNo. of responders (%) 109 (58.9%) 78 (42.6%) \n\n95% CI (51.5, 66.1) (35.4, 50.1) \n No. of complete response (%) 19 (10.3%) 2 (1.1%) \n\n No. of partial response (%) 90 (48.6%) 76 (41.5%) \n\n No. of stable disease 38 (20.5%) 49 (26.8%) \n\nInvestigator-assessed DOR3 n=109 n=78 \nMedian in months 8.5 5.5 \n\n95% CI (7.3, 9.7) (3.7, 7.1) \n1.

Data for patients ≥75 years of age are too limited to \ndraw conclusions on this population. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n \n\nPaediatric population \n \nAn early phase, multi-centre open-label study was conducted in paediatric (<18, n=69) and young \nadult patients (18-30 years, n=18) with relapsed or progressive solid tumours as well as with \nHodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of \natezolizumab. Patients were treated with 15 mg/kg atezolizumab IV every 3 weeks (see section 5.2).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nExposure to atezolizumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg \nincluding the fixed dose 1,200 mg administered every 3 weeks. A population analysis that included \n472 patients described atezolizumab pharmacokinetics for the dose range: 1 to 20 mg/kg with a linear \ntwo-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination. The pharmacokinetic properties of \natezolizumab 840 mg administered every 2 weeks and atezolizumab 1,200 mg administered every \n3 weeks are comparable. A population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that steady-state is obtained \nafter 6 to 9 weeks after multiple doses. The maximum systemic accumulation ratio across dosing \nregimens is 3.3. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAtezolizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion. There have been no studies performed with \nother routes of administration. \n \nDistribution \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that central compartment volume of distribution is \n3.28 L and volume at steady-state is 6.91 L in the typical patient. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe metabolism of atezolizumab has not been directly studied. Antibodies are cleared principally by \ncatabolism. \n \nElimination \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the clearance of atezolizumab is 0.200 L/day and \nthe typical terminal elimination half-life is 27 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nBased on population PK and exposure-response analyses age (21-89 years), region, ethnicity, renal \nimpairment, mild hepatic impairment, level of PD-L1 expression, or ECOG performance status have \nno effect on atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. Body weight, gender, positive ADA status, albumin \nlevels and tumour burden have a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant effect on \natezolizumab pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustments are recommended. \n \nElderly \n \nNo dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in elderly patients. The effect of age on the \npharmacokinetics of atezolizumab was assessed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Age was \nnot identified as a significant covariate influencing atezolizumab pharmacokinetics based on patients \nof age range of 21-89 years (n=472), and median of 62 years of age. No clinically important difference \nwas observed in the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab among patients < 65 years (n=274), patients \nbetween 65−75 years (n=152) and patients > 75 years (n=46) (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n32 \n \n \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetic results from one early-phase, multi-centre open-label study that was conducted \nin paediatric (<18 years, n=69) and young adult patients (18-30 years, n=18), show that the clearance \nand volume of distribution of atezolizumab were comparable between paediatric patients receiving \n15 mg/kg and young adult patients receiving 1,200 mg of atezolizumab every 3 weeks when \nnormalized by body weight, with exposure trending lower in paediatric patients as body weight \ndecreased. These differences were not associated with a decrease in atezolizumab concentrations \nbelow the therapeutic target exposure. Data for children <2 years is limited thus no definitive \nconclusions can be made.  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. In the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically important differences in the clearance of \natezolizumab were found in patients with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 60 to \n89 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=208) or, moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=116) renal impairment \ncompared to patients with normal (eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=140) renal \nfunction. Only a few patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=8) (see \nsection 4.2). The effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is \nunknown. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. In the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no clinically important differences in the clearance of \natezolizumab between patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or \nbilirubin > 1.0 × to 1.5 × ULN and any AST, n= 71) and normal hepatic function (bilirubin and AST ≤ \nULN, n = 401). No data are available in patients with either moderate or severe hepatic impairment. \nHepatic impairment was defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria of hepatic dysfunction \n(see section 4.2). The effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 × to 3 × ULN \nand any AST or bilirubin > 3 × ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is \nunknown. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of \natezolizumab. \n \nMutagenicity \n \nMutagenicity studies have not been performed to establish the mutagenic potential of atezolizumab. \nHowever, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes.  \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility studies have been conducted with atezolizumab; however assessment of the cynomolgus \nmonkey male and female reproductive organs was included in the chronic toxicity study. Weekly \nadministration of atezolizumab to female monkeys at an estimated AUC approximately 6 times the \nAUC in patients receiving the recommended dose caused an irregular menstrual cycle pattern and a \nlack of newly formed corpora lutea in the ovaries which were reversible. There was no effect on the \nmale reproductive organs.  \n \n\n\n\n33 \n \n \n\nTeratogenicity  \n \nNo reproductive or teratogenicity studies in animals have been conducted with atezolizumab. Animal \nstudies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to immune-related \nrejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death. Administration of atezolizumab could \ncause foetal harm, including embryo-foetal lethality. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nUrothelial carcinoma  \n \nTecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC): \n• after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy, or \n• who are considered cisplatin ineligible, and whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 5% (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer   \n \nTecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line \ntreatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In \npatients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC, Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, \npaclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies (see section \n5.1). \n \nTecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC \nshould also have received targeted therapies before receiving Tecentriq (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n \n\nTecentriq, in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment \nof adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who do not have EGFR mutant or \nALK-positive NSCLC (see section 5.1). \n \nSmall cell lung cancer  \n \nTecentriq, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, is indicated for the first-line treatment of \nadult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTecentriq must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer. \n \nPD-L1 testing for patients with UC \n \nPatients with previously untreated UC should be selected for treatment based on the tumour expression \nof PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (see section 5.1). \n \nPosology \n \nTecentriq monotherapy \n \nThe recommended dose of Tecentriq is 1,200 mg administered intravenously every three weeks.  \n \nTecentriq in combination therapy \n \nPlease also refer to the full prescribing information for the combination products (see also section 5.1). \n \n1L non-squamous NSCLC \n \nTecentriq in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin \n \nDuring the induction phase, the recommended dose of Tecentriq is 1,200 mg administered by \nintravenous infusion, followed by bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and then carboplatin every three weeks for \nfour or six cycles. \n \nThe induction phase is followed by a maintenance phase without chemotherapy in which 1,200 mg \nTecentriq followed by bevacizumab, is administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks. \n \nTecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin \n \nDuring the induction phase, the recommended dose of Tecentriq is 1,200 mg administered by \nintravenous infusion, followed by nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin every three weeks for four or six \ncycles. For each 21-day cycle, Tecentriq, nab-paclitaxel, and carboplatin are administered on day 1. In \naddition, nab-paclitaxel is administered on days 8 and 15. \n \nThe induction phase is followed by a maintenance phase without chemotherapy in which 1,200 mg \nTecentriq is administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks.  \n \n1L ES-SCLC \n \nTecentriq in combination with carboplatin and etoposide \n \nDuring the induction phase, the recommended dose of Tecentriq is 1,200 mg administered by \nintravenous infusion followed by carboplatin, and then etoposide administered by intravenous infusion \n\n\n\n38 \n \n \n\non day 1. Etoposide is also administered by intravenous infusion on days 2 and 3. This regimen is \nadministered every three weeks for four cycles. \n \nThe induction phase is followed by a maintenance phase without chemotherapy in which 1,200 mg \nTecentriq is administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks. \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nIt is recommended that patients are treated with Tecentriq until loss of clinical benefit (see section 5.1) \nor unmanageable toxicity. \n \nFor ES-SCLC and for first-line NSCLC, in patients given Tecentriq in combination with carboplatin \nand nab-paclitaxel, it is recommended that patients are treated with Tecentriq until disease progression \nor unmanageable toxicity. Treatment beyond disease progression may be considered at the discretion \nof the physician (see section 5.1). \n \nDelayed or missed doses \n \nIf a planned dose of Tecentriq is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. The schedule \nof administration must be adjusted to maintain a 3-week interval between doses.  \n  \nDose modifications during treatment \n \nDose reductions of Tecentriq are not recommended. \n \nDose delay or discontinuation (see also sections 4.4 and 4.8) \n \nTable 1: Dose modification advice for Tecentriq \n \nImmune related adverse \nreaction \n\nSeverity Treatment modification \n\nPneumonitis \n \n\nGrade 2 Withhold Tecentriq \n \nTreatment may be resumed when the \nevent improves to Grade 0 or Grade 1 \nwithin 12 weeks, and corticosteroids \nhave been reduced to ≤ 10 mg \nprednisone or equivalent per day \n\n Grade 3 or 4 Permanently discontinue Tecentriq \nHepatitis  \n \n\nGrade 2: \n(ALT or AST > 3 to 5 x upper limit of \nnormal [ULN] \n \nor \n \nblood bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN) \n \n\nWithhold Tecentriq \n \nTreatment may be resumed when the \nevent improves to Grade 0 or Grade 1 \nwithin 12 weeks and corticosteroids \nhave been reduced to ≤ 10 mg \nprednisone or equivalent per day \n\nGrade 3 or 4: \n(ALT or AST > 5 x ULN \n \nor \n \nblood bilirubin > 3 x ULN) \n\nPermanently discontinue Tecentriq \n\n\n\n39 \n \n \n\nImmune related adverse \nreaction \n\nSeverity Treatment modification \n\nColitis \n \n\nGrade 2 or 3 Diarrhoea (increase of ≥ 4 \nstools/day over baseline) \n \nor \n \nSymptomatic Colitis \n\nWithhold Tecentriq  \n \nTreatment may be resumed when the \nevent improves to Grade 0 or Grade 1 \nwithin 12 weeks and corticosteroids \nhave been reduced to ≤ 10 mg \nprednisone or equivalent per day \n\nGrade 4 Diarrhoea or Colitis (life \nthreatening;

Currently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation \non a posology can be made. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n \n\nElderly \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment of Tecentriq is required in \npatients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  \n \nAsian patients \n \nDue to increased haematologic toxicities observed in Asian patients in IMpower150, it is \nrecommended that the starting dose of paclitaxel should be 175 mg/m2 every three weeks. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild \nor moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment are \ntoo limited to draw conclusions on this population. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required for patients with mild \nhepatic impairment. Tecentriq has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2). \n \nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2 \n \nPatients with ECOG performance status ≥ 2 were excluded from the clinical trials in NSCLC, ES-\nSCLC and 2nd line UC (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nTecentriq is for intravenous use. The infusions must not be administered as an intravenous push or \nbolus. \n \nThe initial dose of Tecentriq must be administered over 60 minutes. If the first infusion is well \ntolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. \n \nFor instructions on dilution and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to atezolizumab or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. \n \nImmune-related adverse reactions \n \nMost immune-related adverse reactions occurring during treatment with atezolizumab were reversible \nwith interruptions of atezolizumab and initiation of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. \nImmune-related adverse reactions affecting more than one body system have been observed. \nImmune-related adverse reactions with atezolizumab may occur after the last dose of atezolizumab. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n \n \n\nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, thorough evaluation to confirm aetiology or exclude \nother causes should be performed. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, atezolizumab should \nbe withheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid should \nbe tapered over ≥ 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose \nimmune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with systemic corticosteroid use, \nadministration of other systemic immunosuppressants may be considered. \n \nAtezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related adverse reaction \nthat recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-related adverse reactions, except for endocrinopathies that are \ncontrolled with replacement hormones (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nImmune-related pneumonitis  \n \nCases of pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab \n(see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and causes \nother than immune-related pneumonitis should be ruled out. \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 pneumonitis, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nprednisone or equivalent should be started. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should \nbe tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to \n≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or \nequivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 \npneumonitis. \n \nImmune-related hepatitis  \n \nCases of hepatitis, some leading to fatal outcomes have been observed in clinical trials with \natezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis. \n \nAspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin should be monitored \nprior to initiation of treatment, periodically during treatment with atezolizumab and as indicated based \non clinical evaluation. \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld if Grade 2 event (ALT or AST > 3 to 5 x ULN or \nblood bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN) persists for more than 5 to 7 days, and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of \nprednisone or equivalent should be started. If the event improves to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should \nbe tapered over ≥ 1 month.  \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and \ncorticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with \natezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 events (ALT or AST \n> 5.0 x ULN or blood bilirubin > 3 x ULN). \n \nImmune-related colitis \n \nCases of diarrhoea or colitis have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis.  \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 3 diarrhoea (increase of ≥ 4 stools/day \nover baseline) or colitis (symptomatic). For Grade 2 diarrhoea or colitis, if symptoms persist > 5 days \nor recur, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent should be started. For \nGrade 3 diarrhoea or colitis, treatment with intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, treatment with \n1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, \ncorticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the \nevent improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg \n\n\n\n43 \n \n \n\nprednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for \nGrade 4 (life threatening; urgent intervention indicated) diarrhoea or colitis. \n \nImmune-related endocrinopathies  \n \nHypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, \nincluding diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section \n4.8).  \n \nPatients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies. Thyroid function \nshould be monitored prior to and periodically during treatment with atezolizumab. Appropriate \nmanagement of patients with abnormal thyroid function tests at baseline should be considered. \n \nAsymptomatic patients with abnormal thyroid function tests can receive atezolizumab. For \nsymptomatic hypothyroidism, atezolizumab should be withheld and thyroid hormone replacement \nshould be initiated as needed. Isolated hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy and \nwithout corticosteroids. For symptomatic hyperthyroidism, atezolizumab should be withheld and an \nanti-thyroid medicinal product should be initiated as needed. Treatment with atezolizumab may be \nresumed when symptoms are controlled and thyroid function is improving. \n \nFor symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, atezolizumab should be withheld and treatment with \nintravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. \nOnce symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should follow. \nIf symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment may \nbe resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced \nto ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day and the patient is stable on replacement therapy (if \nrequired). \n \nFor Grade 2 or Grade 3 hypophysitis, atezolizumab should be withheld and treatment with intravenous \ncorticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started, and hormone \nreplacement should be initiated as needed. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nof prednisone or equivalent should follow. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroids should \nbe tapered over ≥ 1 month. Treatment may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within \n12 weeks and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day and the \npatient is stable on replacement therapy (if required). Treatment with atezolizumab should be \npermanently discontinued for Grade 4 hypophysitis. \n \nTreatment with insulin should be initiated for type 1 diabetes mellitus. For ≥ Grade 3 hyperglycaemia \n(fasting glucose > 250 mg/dL or 13.9 mmol/L), atezolizumab should be withheld. Treatment with \natezolizumab may be resumed if metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement therapy. \n \nImmune-related meningoencephalitis  \n \nMeningoencephalitis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any grade of meningitis or \nencephalitis. Treatment with intravenous corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or \nequivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, treatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone \nor equivalent should follow.  \n \nImmune-related neuropathies \n \nMyasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome, which may be life threatening, \nwere observed in patients receiving atezolizumab. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of \nmotor and sensory neuropathy.  \n\n\n\n44 \n \n \n\n \nTreatment with atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any grade of myasthenic \nsyndrome / myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids (at a \ndose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) should be considered. \n \nImmune-related pancreatitis \n \nPancreatitis, including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, has been observed in clinical \ntrials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms that are suggestive of acute pancreatitis. \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for ≥ Grade 3 serum amylase or lipase levels \nincreased (> 2 x ULN), or Grade 2 or 3 pancreatitis, and treatment with intravenous corticosteroids  \n(1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) should be started. Once symptoms improve, \ntreatment with 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should follow. Treatment with \natezolizumab may be resumed when serum amylase and lipase levels improve to ≤ Grade 1 within \n12 weeks, or symptoms of pancreatitis have resolved, and corticosteroids have been reduced to \n≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be permanently \ndiscontinued for Grade 4, or any grade of recurrent pancreatitis. \n \nImmune-related myocarditis \n \nMyocarditis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of myocarditis.  \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 myocarditis, and treatment with systemic \ncorticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. Treatment \nwith atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and \ncorticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with \natezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 myocarditis. \n \nImmune-related nephritis \n \nNephritis has been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for changes in renal function.  \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 nephritis, and treatment with systemic \ncorticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent should be started. Treatment \nwith atezolizumab may be resumed if the event improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and \ncorticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with \natezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. \n \nImmune-related myositis  \n \nCases of myositis, including fatal cases, have been observed in clinical trials with atezolizumab (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myositis.  \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 3 myositis and corticosteroid therapy \n(1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) should be initiated. If symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 1, taper \ncorticosteroids as clinically indicated. Treatment with atezolizumab may be resumed if the event \nimproves to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, and corticosteroids have been reduced to ≤ 10 mg oral \nprednisone or equivalent per day. Treatment with atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued \nfor Grade 4 or grade 3 recurrent myositis, or when unable to reduce the corticosteroid dose to the \nequivalent of ≤ 10 mg prednisone per day within 12 weeks after onset. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions have been observed with atezolizumab (see section 4.8).  \n \nThe rate of infusion should be reduced or treatment should be interrupted in patients with Grade 1 or 2 \ninfusion-related reactions. Atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients with Grade 3 \nor 4 infusion-related reactions. Patients with Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions may continue to \nreceive atezolizumab with close monitoring; premedication with antipyretic and antihistamines may be \nconsidered.  \n \nDisease-specific precautions \n \nUse of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in metastatic \nnon-squamous non-small cell lung cancer  \n \nPhysicians should carefully consider the combined risks of the four-drug regimen of atezolizumab \nbevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin before initiating treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nUse of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel in metastatic triple negative breast cancer \n \nNeutropenia and peripheral neuropathies occurring during treatment with atezolizumab and nab-\npaclitaxel may be reversible with interruptions of nab-paclitaxel. Physicians should consult the nab-\npaclitaxel summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for specific precautions and contraindications \nof this medicine. \n \nPatients excluded from clinical trials \n \nPatients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical trials: a history of autoimmune \ndisease, history of pneumonitis, active brain metastasis, HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, \nsignificant cardiovascular disease and patients with inadequate hematologic and end-organ function.  \nPatients who were administered a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to enrolment; systemic \nimmunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within \n2 weeks prior to study entry were excluded from clinical trials.  \n \nUse of atezolizumab in urothelial carcinoma for previously untreated patients who are considered \ncisplatin ineligible \n \nThe baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the IMvigor210 Cohort 1 study population were \noverall comparable to patients in the clinic who would be considered cisplatin ineligible but would be \neligible for a carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy. There are insufficient data for the \nsubgroup of patients that would be unfit for any chemotherapy; therefore atezolizumab should be used \nwith caution in these patients, after careful consideration of the potential balance of risks and benefits \non an individual basis. \n \nUse of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin  \n \nPatients with NSCLC that had clear tumour infiltration into the thoracic great vessels or clear \ncavitation of pulmonary lesions, as seen on imaging, were excluded from the pivotal clinical study \nIMpower150 after several cases of fatal pulmonary haemorrhage were observed, which is a known \nrisk factor of treatment with bevacizumab.  \n \nIn the absence of data, atezolizumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful \nevaluation of the balance of benefits and risks for the patient. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n \n \n\nUse of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in EGFR+ patients \nwith NSCLC who have progressed on erlotinib+bevacizumab \n \nIn study IMpower150, there are no data on the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with \nbevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in EGFR+ patients who have progressed previously on \nerlotinib+bevacizumab.  \n \nPatient alert card \n \nAll prescribers of Tecentriq must be familiar with the Physician Information and Management \nGuidelines. The prescriber must discuss the risks of Tecentriq therapy with the patient. The patient \nwill be provided with the patient alert card and instructed to carry the card at all times. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with atezolizumab. Since \natezolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug interactions \nare expected.  \n \nThe use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting atezolizumab should be \navoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of \natezolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used to treat \nimmune-related adverse reactions after starting atezolizumab (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for 5 months after \ntreatment with atezolizumab. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of atezolizumab in pregnant women. No developmental and \nreproductive studies were conducted with atezolizumab. Animal studies have demonstrated that \ninhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in murine pregnancy models can lead to immune-related \nrejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death (see section 5.3). These results indicate a \npotential risk, based on its mechanism of action, that administration of atezolizumab during pregnancy \ncould cause foetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth.  \n \nHuman immunoglobulins G1 (IgG1) are known to cross the placental barrier and atezolizumab is an \nIgG1; therefore, atezolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing \nfoetus.  \n \nAtezolizumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman \nrequires treatment with atezolizumab. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether atezolizumab is excreted in human milk. Atezolizumab is a monoclonal \nantibody and is expected to be present in the first milk and at low levels afterwards. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue Tecentriq therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and \nthe benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n \n \n\nFertility \n \nNo clinical data are available on the possible effects of atezolizumab on fertility. No reproductive and \ndevelopment toxicity studies have been conducted with atezolizumab; however, based on the 26-week \nrepeat dose toxicity study, atezolizumab had an effect on menstrual cycles at an estimated AUC \napproximately 6 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose and was reversible (see \nsection 5.3). There were no effects on the male reproductive organs. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTecentriq has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing fatigue \nshould be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of atezolizumab as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 3,178 patients across multiple \ntumour types. The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) were fatigue (35.9%), decreased appetite \n(25.5%), nausea (23.5%), cough (20.8%), dyspnoea (20.5%), pyrexia (20.1%), diarrhoea (19.7%), rash \n(19.5%), musculoskeletal pain (15.4%) back pain (15.3%), vomiting (15.0%), asthenia (14.5%), \narthralgia (13.9%), , pruritus (12.6%) and urinary tract infection (11.6%). \n \nThe safety of atezolizumab given in combination with other medicinal products, has been evaluated in \n3,878 patients across multiple tumour types. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were \nanaemia (40.3%), neutropenia (39.4%), nausea (37.3%), fatigue (34.4%), alopecia (29.6%), \nthrombocytopenia (28.9%), diarrhoea (28.1%), rash (27.7%), constipation (27.2%), peripheral \nneuropathy (25.7%), and decreased appetite (25.5%). \n \nFurther details on serious adverse reactions are provided in Section 4.4 Warnings & Precautions. \n  \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and categories \nof frequency in Table 2 for atezolizumab given as monotherapy or as combination therapy. Adverse \nreactions known to occur with atezolizumab or chemotherapies given alone may occur during \ntreatment with these medicinal products in combination, even if these reactions were not reported in \nclinical trials with combination therapy. The following categories of frequency have been used: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \nthe order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with atezolizumab \n \n\nAtezolizumab monotherapy Atezolizumab in combination therapy \nInfections and infestations \nVery common urinary tract infectiona lung infectionb \n\nCommon  blood alkaline phosphatase, blood creatinine \nincreasedc \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common  anaemia, thrombocytopeniad, neutropeniae, \n\nleukopeniaf \nCommon thrombocytopeniad lymphopeniag \n\nImmune system disorders \nCommon infusion-related reactionh  \n\nEndocrine disorders \nVery common  hypothyroidismi \nCommon Hypothyroidismi hyperthyroidismj \n\nUncommon hyperthyroidismj, diabetes \nmellitusk, adrenal insufficiencyl \n\n \n\nRare hypophysitism  \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \nVery common decreased appetite decreased appetite, hypomagnesaemian  \n\nCommon hypokalaemiaae, hyponatraemiaaf, \nhyperglycaemia \n\nhypokalaemiaae, hyponatraemiaaf, \n\nNervous system disorders  \nVery Common  peripheral neuropathyo , dizziness, headache \nCommon  syncope \nUncommon Guillain-Barré syndromep, \n\nmeningoencephalitisq \n \n\nRare myasthenic syndromer  \n\nEye Disorders \n\nRare uveitis  \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nRare myocarditiss  \n\nVascular disorders \nVery Common  hypertensionai \n\nCommon hypotension  \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders \nVery common cough, dyspnoea dyspnoea, cough \n\nCommon pneumonitist, hypoxiaag, nasal \ncongestion, nasopharyngitis \n\ndysphonia \n\n\n\n49 \n \n \n\nAtezolizumab monotherapy Atezolizumab in combination therapy \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common nausea, vomiting, diarrhoeau nausea, diarrhoeau, constipation, vomiting  \n\nCommon abdominal pain, colitisv, dysphagia, \noropharyngeal painw \n\nstomatitis, dysgeusia \n\nUncommon pancreatitisx  \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon AST increased, ALT increased, \n\nhepatitisy \nAST increased, ALT increased \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery Common rashz, pruritus rashz, pruritus, alopeciaah \n\nUncommon psoriasis psoriasis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common arthralgia, back pain, \n\nmusculoskeletal painaa \narthralgia, musculoskeletal painaa, back pain \n\nUncommon myositisab  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon  proteinuriaac \n\nRare nephritisad  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery Common pyrexia, fatigue, asthenia pyrexia, fatigue, asthenia \n\nCommon influenza like illness, chills  \na Includes reports of urinary tract infection, cystitis, pyelonephritis, escherichia urinary tract infection, urinary \ntract infection bacterial, kidney infection, pyelonephritis acute, urinary tract infection fungal, urinary tract \ninfection pseudomonal. \nb Includes reports of pneumonia, bronchitis, lung infection, lower respiratory tract infection, infective \nexacerbation of COPD, infectious pleural effusion, tracheobronchitis, atypical pneumonia, lung abscess, \nparacancerous pneumonia, pyopneumothorax, pleural infection.  \nc.

The median time to onset was 5.5 months (range: 3 days to 19 months). The median \nduration was 16.8 months (range: 0 day to 16.8 months). Adrenal insufficiency led to discontinuation \nof atezolizumab in 1 (<0.1%) patient. Adrenal insufficiency requiring the use of corticosteroids \noccurred in 0.3% (9/3,178) of patients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy. \n \nHypophysitis \n \nHypophysitis occurred in < 0.1% (2/3,178) of patients who received atezolizumab monotherapy. The \nmedian time to onset 7.2 months (range: 24 days to 13.7 months). One patient required the use of \ncorticosteroids and treatment with atezolizumab was discontinued. \n \nHypophysitis occurred in 0.8% (3/393) of patients who received atezolizumab with bevacizumab, \npaclitaxel, and carboplatin.

The median duration was 26 \ndays (range 6 days to 14.5+ months; + denotes a censored value).  \n \nMeningoencephalitis requiring the use of corticosteroids occurred in 0.2% (6/3,178) of patients \nreceiving atezolizumab and four patients discontinued atezolizumab.  \n\n\n\n52 \n \n \n\n \nImmune-related neuropathies \n \nGuillain-Barré syndrome and demyelinating polyneuropathy occurred in 0.2% (5/3,178) of patients \nwho received atezolizumab monotherapy. The median time to onset was 7 months (range: 18 days to \n8.1 months). The median duration was 8.0 months (range 18 days to 8.3+ months; + denotes a \ncensored value). Guillain-Barré syndrome led to discontinuation of atezolizumab in 1 patient (< 0.1%). \nGuillain-Barré syndrome requiring the use of corticosteroids occurred in < 0.1% (2/3,178) of patients \nreceiving atezolizumab monotherapy. \n \nMyasthenic syndrome  \n \nMyasthenia gravis occurred in < 0.1% (1/3,178) of patients who received atezolizumab monotherapy. \nThe time to onset was 1.2 months.  \n \nImmune-related pancreatitis \n \nPancreatitis, including amylase increased and lipase increased, occurred in 0.6% (18/3,178) of patients \nwho received atezolizumab monotherapy. The median time to onset was 5.0 months (range: 9 days to \n16.9 months). The median duration was 24 days (range 3 days to 12.0+ months; + denotes a censored \nvalue). Pancreatitis led to the discontinuation of atezolizumab in 3 (< 0.1%) patients. Pancreatitis \nrequiring the use of corticosteroids occurred in 0.1% (4/3,178) of patients receiving atezolizumab \nmonotherapy. \n \nImmune-related myocarditis  \n \nMyocarditis occurred in < 0.1% (2/8,000) of patients across all atezolizumab clinical trials in multiple \ntumour types and treatment combinations. The time to onset was 18 and 33 days. Both patients \nrequired corticosteroids and discontinued atezolizumab.  \n \nImmune-related nephritis \n \nNephritis occurred in < 0.1% (3/3,178) of patients who received atezolizumab. The median time to \nonset was 13.1 months (range: 9.0 to 17.5 months). The median duration was 2.8 months (range 15 \ndays to 9.5+ months; + denotes a censored value). Nephritis led to discontinuation of atezolizumab in \n2 (<0.1%) patients. One patient required corticosteroids and discontinued atezolizumab. \n \nImmune-related myositis \n \nMyositis occurred in 0.4% (12/3178) of patients who received atezolizumab monotherapy. The median \ntime to onset was 5.4 months (range: 0.7 to 11.0 months). The median duration was 3.5 months (range \n0.1 to 22.6+ months; + denotes a censored value). Myositis led to discontinuation of atezolizumab in 1 \n(<0.1%) patient. Seven (0.2%) patients required the use of corticosteroids.  \n \nUse of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin  \n \nIn the first-line NSCLC study (IMpower150), an overall higher frequency of adverse events was \nobserved in the four-drug regimen of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin \ncompared to atezolizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, including Grade 3 and 4 events (63.6% \ncompared to 57.5%), Grade 5 events (6.1% compared to 2.5%), adverse events of special interest to \natezolizumab (52.4% compared to 48.0%), as well as adverse events leading to withdrawal of any \nstudy treatment (33.8% compared to 13.3%). Nausea, diarrhoea, stomatitis, fatigue, pyrexia, mucosal \ninflammation, decreased appetite, weight decreased, hypertension and proteinuria were reported \nhigher (≥5% difference) in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, \npaclitaxel and carboplatin. Other clinically significant adverse events which were observed more \n\n\n\n53 \n \n \n\nfrequently in the atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm were epistaxis, \nhaemoptysis, cerebrovascular accident, including fatal events. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAcross multiple phase III studies, 13.1 % to 36.4% of patients developed treatment-emergent anti-drug \nantibodies (ADAs).  \n \nAcross pooled datasets for patients treated with atezolizumab monotherapy (N=2705) and with \ncombination therapies (N=1811), the following rates of adverse events (AEs) have been observed for \nthe ADA-positive population compared to the ADA-negative population, respectively: Grade 3-4 AEs \n49.1% vs. 44.3%,  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 42.4% vs. 37.6%, AEs leading to treatment \nwithdrawal 6.1% vs 6.7% (for monotherapy); Grade 3-4 AEs 65.3% vs. 63.6%, SAEs 42.1% vs. \n36.6%, AEs leading to treatment withdrawal 24.3% vs 19.5% (for combination therapy). However, \navailable data do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn on possible patterns of adverse drug reactions.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety of atezolizumab in children and adolescents has not been established. No new safety signals \nwere observed in a clinical study with 69 paediatric patients (<18 years) and the safety profile was \ncomparable to adults. \n \nElderly patients \n \nNo overall differences in safety were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and younger \npatients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy. In study IMpower150, age ≥ 65 was associated with an \nincreased risk of developing adverse events in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with \nbevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel. \n \nIn studies IMpower150 and IMpower133, data for patients ≥75 years of age are too limited to draw \nconclusions on this population.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no information on overdose with atezolizumab.  \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, \nand appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC32 \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n54 \n \n \n\nMechanism of action \n \nProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) may be expressed on tumour cells and/or tumour-infiltrating \nimmune cells, and can contribute to the inhibition of the antitumour immune response in the tumour \nmicroenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T-cells and antigen \npresenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.  \n \nAtezolizumab is an Fc-engineered, humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that \ndirectly binds to PD-L1 and provides a dual blockade of the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors, releasing \nPD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response, including reactivating the antitumour \nimmune response without inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Atezolizumab spares the \nPD-L2/PD-1 interaction allowing PD-L2/PD-1 mediated inhibitory signals to persist.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nTreatment with atezolizumab until loss of clinical benefit was permitted as defined by the following \ncriteria: \n• Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values [e.g., new or \n\nworsening hypercalcaemia]) indicating unequivocal progression of disease \n• No decline in ECOG performance status  \n• Absence of tumour progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that \n\ncannot be readily managed and stabilised by protocol-allowed medical interventions prior to \nrepeat dosing \n\n• Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator \n \nPatients with ES-SCLC were treated with atezolizumab until disease progression. Treatment beyond \ndisease progression was permitted at the discretion of the physician. \n \nPatients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who are ineligible for cisplatin therapy were treated \nwith atezolizumab until disease progression. \n \nUrothelial carcinoma \n \nIMvigor211 (GO29294): Randomised trial in locally advanced or metastatic UC patients previously \ntreated with chemotherapy \n \nA phase III, open-label, multi-center, international, randomised study, (IMvigor211), was conducted to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy (investigator’s choice \nof vinflunine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who \nprogressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. This study excluded patients who had \na history of autoimmune disease; active or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases; administration \nof a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to enrolment; and administration of systemic \nimmunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal product within \n2 weeks prior to enrolment. Tumour assessments were conducted every 9 weeks for the first 54 weeks, \nand every 12 weeks thereafter. Tumour specimens were evaluated prospectively for PD-L1 expression \non tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) and the results were used to define the PD-L1 expression \nsubgroups for the analyses described below.  \n \nA total of 931 patients were enrolled. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either atezolizumab or \nchemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by chemotherapy (vinflunine vs. taxane), PD-L1 \nexpression status on IC (< 5% vs. ≥ 5%), number of prognostic risk factors (0 vs. 1-3), and liver \nmetastases (yes vs. no). Prognostic risk factors included time from prior chemotherapy of < 3 months, \nECOG performance status > 0 and haemoglobin < 10 g/dL. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n \n \n\nAtezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1,200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. \nNo dose reduction of atezolizumab was allowed. Patients were treated until loss of clinical benefit as \nassessed by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity. Vinflunine was administered 320 mg/m2 by \nintravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \nPaclitaxel was administered 175 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 3 hours on day 1 of each 3-week \ncycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Docetaxel was administered 75 mg/m2 by \nintravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \nFor all treated patients, the median duration of treatment was 2.8 months for the atezolizumab arm, \n2.1 months for the vinflunine and paclitaxel arms and 1.6 months for the docetaxel arm. \n \nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the primary analysis population were well \nbalanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 67 years (range: 31 to 88), and 77.1% of \npatients were male. The majority of patients were white (72.1%), 53.9% of patients within the \nchemotherapy arm received vinflunine, 71.4% of patients had at least one poor prognostic risk factor \nand 28.8% had liver metastases at baseline. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (45.6%) or 1 \n(54.4%). Bladder was the primary tumour site for 71.1% of patients and 25.4% of patients had upper \ntract urothelial carcinoma. There were 24.2% of patients who received only prior platinum-containing \nadjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy and progressed within 12 months. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint for IMvigor211 is overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy endpoints \nevaluated per investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 are \nobjective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR). \nComparisons with respect to OS between the treatment arm and control arm within the IC2/3, IC1/2/3, \nand ITT (Intention-to-treat, i.e. all comers) populations were tested using a hierarchical fixed-sequence \nprocedure based on a stratified log-rank test at two-sided level of 5% as follows: step 1) IC2/3 \npopulation; step 2) IC1/2/3 population; step 3) all comers population. OS results for each of steps 2 \nand 3 could be formally tested for statistical significance only if the result in the preceding step was \nstatistically significant. \n \nThe median survival follow-up is 17 months. The primary analysis of study IMvigor211 did not meet \nits primary endpoint of OS. Atezolizumab did not demonstrate a statistically significant survival \nbenefit compared to chemotherapy in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic \nurothelial carcinoma. Per the pre-specified hierarchical testing order, the IC2/3 population was tested \nfirst, with an OS HR of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.21; median OS of 11.1 vs. 10.6 months for atezolizumab \nand chemotherapy respectively). The stratified log-rank p-value was 0.41 and therefore the results are \nconsidered not statistically significant in this population. As a consequence, no formal tests of \nstatistical significance could be performed for OS in the IC1/2/3 or all comer populations, and results \nof those analyses would be considered exploratory. The key results in the all comer population are \nsummarised in Table 3. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS in the all comer population is presented in \nFigure 1. \n \nAn exploratory updated survival analysis was performed with a median duration of survival follow up \nof 34 months in the ITT population. The median OS was 8.6 months (95% CI: 7.8, 9.6) in the \natezolizumab arm and 8.0 months (95% CI: 7.2, 8.6) in the chemotherapy arm with a hazard ratio of \n0.82 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.94). Consistent with the trend observed at primary analysis for 12-month OS \nrates, numerically higher 24-month and 30-month OS rates were observed for patients in the \natezolizumab arm compared with the chemotherapy arm in the ITT population.

Cohort 1 included previously \nuntreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who were ineligible or unfit for \ncisplatin-based chemotherapy or had disease progression at least 12 months after treatment with a \nplatinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Cohort 2 included patients who \nreceived at least one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic UC or \nhad disease progression within 12 months of treatment with a platinum-containing neoadjuvant or \nadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. \n \nIn Cohort 1, 119 patients were treated with atezolizumab 1,200 mg by intravenous infusion every \n3 weeks until disease progression. The median age was 73 years.

The median age was 63 years (range: 31 to 90), and 60% of patients were \nmale. The majority of patients were white (82%). Approximately 10% of patients had known EGFR \nmutation, 4% had known ALK rearrangements, 14% had liver metastasis at baseline, and most \npatients were current or previous smokers (80%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (43%) or \n1 (57%). 51% of patients’ tumours had PD-L1 expression of ≥ 1% TC or ≥ 1% IC and 49% of \npatients’ tumours had PD-L1 expression of < 1% TC and < 1% IC. \n \nAt the time of the final analysis for PFS, patients had a median follow up time of 15.3 months. The \nITT population, including patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements who should have \nbeen previously treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, demonstrated clinically meaningful PFS \nimprovement in Arm B as compared to Arm C (HR of 0.61, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.72; median PFS 8.3 vs. \n6.8 months).   \n \nAt the time of the interim OS analysis, patients had a median follow-up of 19.7 months.

Patients with EGFR mutations or \nALK rearrangements should have been previously treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. \n \nPatients were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition. \nPatients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease, administration of live, attenuated \nvaccine within 28 days prior to randomisation, administration of immunostimulatory agents within \n4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomisation, and \nactive or untreated CNS metastases. Patients who had prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune \ncheckpoint blockade therapies (anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies) were not eligible. \nHowever, patients who had prior anti-CTLA-4 treatment could be enrolled, as long as the last dose \nwas received at least 6 weeks prior to randomization, and there was no history of severe immune-\nrelated adverse effects from anti-CTLA-4 (NCI CTCAE Grades 3 and 4). Tumour assessments were \nconducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, then every 9 weeks thereafter. \nTumour specimens were evaluated for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) and tumour infiltrating \nimmune cells (IC) and the results were used to define the PD-L1 expression subgroups for the analyses \ndescribed below. \n \nPatients, including those with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, were enrolled and were \nrandomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive one of the treatment regimens described in Table 8. \nRandomisation was stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases and PD-L1 expression on TC and IC. \nPatients receiving treatment regimen B were able to crossover and receive atezolizumab monotherapy \nfollowing disease progression. \n\n\n\n65 \n \n \n\n \nTable 8: Intravenous treatment regimens (IMpower130) \n \nTreatment  \nRegimen \n\nInduction  \n(Four or six 21-day cycles) \n\nMaintenance  \n(21-day cycles) \n\nA Atezolizumab (1,200 mg)a + nab-paclitaxel \n(100 mg/m2)b,c + carboplatin (AUC 6)c  \n \n\nAtezolizumab (1,200 mg)a \n\nB Nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2)b,c + carboplatin \n(AUC 6)c  \n\nBest supportive care or pemetrexed \n\na Atezolizumab is administered until loss of clinical benefit as assessed by investigator \nb Nab-paclitaxel is administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle \nc Nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin are administered until completion of 4-6 cycles, or progressive disease or \nunacceptable toxicity whichever occurs first \n \nThe demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the study population defined as ITT-WT \n(n=679) were well balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range 18 to \n86 years). The majority of the patients were male (59%) and white (90%). Fourteen point seven \npercent of patients had liver metastases at baseline, and most patients were current or previous \nsmokers (90%). The majority of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 1 (59%) and PD-\nL1 expression <1% (approximately 52%). Among 107 Arm B patients who had a response status of \nstable disease, partial response, or complete response after induction therapy, 40 received pemetrexed \nswitch maintenance therapy.  \n \nThe primary analysis was conducted in all patients, excluding those with EGFR mutations or ALK \nrearrangements, defined as ITT-WT population (n=679). Patients had a median survival follow up \ntime of 18.6 months and showed improved OS and PFS with atezolizumab, nab-paclitaxel and \ncarboplatin as compared to the control. The key results are summarised in Table 9 and Kaplan-Meier \ncurves for OS and PFS are presented in Figures 6 and 8, respectively. The exploratory results of OS \nand PFS by PD-L1 expression are summarised in Figures 7 and 9, respectively. Patients with liver \nmetastases did not show improved PFS or OS with atezolizumab, nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, \ncompared to nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin (HR of 0.93, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.47 for PFS and HR of 1.04, \n95% CI: 0.63, 1.72 for OS, respectively). \n \nFifty-nine percent of patients in the nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin arm received any cancer \nimmunotherapy after disease progression, which includes atezolizumab as crossover treatment (41% \nof all patients), compared to 7.3% of patients in the atezolizumab, nab paclitaxel and carboplatin arm. \n \nIn an exploratory analysis with longer follow up (median: 24.1 months), the median OS for both arms \nwas unchanged relative to the primary analysis, with HR = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.01). \n \n\n\n\n66 \n \n \n\nTable 9: Summary of efficacy from IMpower130 in the primary analysis (ITT-WT population)  \n \nEfficacy endpoints Arm A  \n\nAtezolizumab + \nnab-paclitaxel + \n\ncarboplatin \n\nArm B \nNab-paclitaxel + \n\ncarboplatin \n\nCo-primary endpoints   \nOS n=451 n=228 \nNo. of deaths (%) 226 (50.1%) 131 (57.5%) \nMedian time to events (months) 18.6 13.9 \n95% CI (16.0, 21.2) (12.0, 18.7) \nStratified hazard ratio‡ (95% CI) 0.79 (0.64, 0.98) \np-value 0.033 \n12-month OS (%) 63 56 \nInvestigator-assessed PFS (RECIST v1.1)  n=451 n=228 \nNo. of events (%) 347 (76.9%) 198 (86.8%) \nMedian duration of PFS (months) 7.0 5.5 \n95% CI (6.2, 7.3) (4.4, 5.9) \nStratified hazard ratio‡ (95% CI) 0.64 (0.54, 0.77) \np-value   < 0.0001 \n12-month PFS (%) 29% 14% \n\n  Other endpoints   \nInvestigator-assessed ORR (RECIST v1.1)^ n=447 n=226 \nNo. of confirmed responders (%) 220 (49.2%) 72 (31.9%) \n95% CI (44.5, 54.0) (25.8, 38.4) \nNo. of complete response (%) 11 (2.5%) 3 (1.3%) \nNo. of partial response (%) 209 (46.8%) 69 (30.5%) \n\nInvestigator-assessed confirmed DOR (RECIST 1.1)^ n=220 n=72 \nMedian in months 8.4  6.1 \n95% CI (6.9, 11.8) (5.5, 7.9) \n\n‡ Stratified by sex and PD-L1 expression on TC and IC \n^ Confirmed ORR and DoR are exploratory endpoints  \nPFS=progression-free survival; RECIST=Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1.; CI=confidence \ninterval; ORR=objective response rate; DOR=duration of response; OS=overall survival \n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n \n\nFigure 6: Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (IMpower130) \n \n\n \n \nFigure 7: Forest plot of overall survival by PD-L1 expression (IMpower130) \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n68 \n \n \n\nFigure 8: Kaplan-Meier curves for progression free survival (IMpower130) \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 9: Forest plot of progression free survival by PD-L1 expression (IMpower130) \n \n\n \n \nSecond-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer \n \nOAK (GO28915): Randomised phase III trial in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients \npreviously treated with chemotherapy \n \nA phase III, open-label, multi-center, international, randomised study, OAK, was conducted to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. \nThis study excluded patients who had a history of autoimmune disease, active or \ncorticosteroid-dependent brain metastases, administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days \nprior to enrolment, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic \nimmunosuppressive medicinal product within 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Tumour assessments were \nconducted every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter. Tumour specimens were \nevaluated prospectively for PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) and tumour-infiltrating immune \ncells (IC). \n\n\n\n69 \n \n \n\n \nA total of 1,225 patients were enrolled and per the analysis plan the first 850 randomised patients were \nincluded in the primary efficacy analysis. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression status on \nIC, by the number of prior chemotherapy regimens, and by histology. Patients were randomised (1:1) \nto receive either atezolizumab or docetaxel. \n \nAtezolizumab was administered as a fixed dose of 1,200 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. \nNo dose reduction was allowed. Patients were treated until loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the \ninvestigator. Docetaxel was administered 75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week \ncycle until disease progression. For all treated patients, the median duration of treatment was \n2.1 months for the docetaxel arm and 3.4 months for the atezolizumab arm.  \n \nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the primary analysis population were well \nbalanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range: 33 to 85), and 61% of \npatients were male. The majority of patients were white (70%). Approximately three-quarters of \npatients had non-squamous histology (74%), 10% had known EGFR mutation, 0.2% had known ALK \nrearrangements, 10% had CNS metastases at baseline, and most patients were current or previous \nsmokers (82%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (37%) or 1 (63%). Seventy-five percent of \npatients received only one prior platinum-based therapeutic regimen. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was OS. The key results of this study with a median survival follow-up \nof 21 months are summarised in Table 10. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS in the ITT population are \npresented in Figure 10. Figure 11 summarises the results of OS in the ITT and PD-L1 subgroups, \ndemonstrating OS benefit with atezolizumab in all subgroups, including those with PD-L1 \nexpression < 1% in TC and IC.  \n \n\n\n\n70 \n \n \n\nTable 10: Summary of efficacy in the primary analysis population (all comers)* (OAK) \n \n\nEfficacy endpoint \nAtezolizumab \n\n(n = 425) \nDocetaxel \n(n = 425) \n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint \nOS  \n   No. of deaths (%) 271 (64%) 298 (70%) \n   Median time to events (months)  13.8 9.6 \n   95% CI (11.8, 15.7) (8.6, 11.2) \n\n   Stratifiedǂ hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.73 (0.62, 0.87) \n\n   p-value** 0.0003 \n12-month OS (%)*** 218 (55%) 151 (41%) \n18-month OS (%)*** 157 (40%) 98 (27%) \n\nSecondary endpoints \nInvestigator-assessed PFS (RECIST v1.1) \n   No. of events (%) 380 (89%) 375 (88%) \n   Median duration of PFS (months) 2.8 4.0 \n   95% CI (2.6, 3.0) (3.3, 4.2) \n   Stratified hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.95 (0.82, 1.10) \nInvestigator-assessed ORR (RECIST v1.1) \n   No. of responders (%) 58 (14%) 57 (13%) \n   95% CI (10.5, 17.3) (10.3, 17.0) \nInvestigator-assessed DOR (RECIST v1.1) n = 58 n = 57 \n   Median in months 16.3 6.2 \n   95% CI (10.0, NE) (4.9, 7.6) \nCI = confidence interval; DOR = duration of response; NE = not estimable; ORR = objective response rate; \nOS = overall survival; PFS = progression-free survival; RECIST = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \nTumours v1.1. \n* The primary analysis population consists of the first 850 randomised patients \nǂ Stratified by PD-L1 expression in tumour infiltrating immune cells, the number of prior chemotherapy \nregimens, and histology \n** Based on the stratified log-rank test \n*** Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates \n \n\n\n\n71 \n \n \n\nFigure 10: Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival in the primary analysis population (all \ncomers) (OAK) \n \n\n \n \nFigure 11: Forest plot of overall survival by PD-L1 expression in the primary analysis \npopulation (OAK) \n \n\n \n \n\naStratified HR for ITT and TC or IC ≥ 1%.

However, patients with EGFR mutations did not show improved OS with atezolizumab \ncompared to docetaxel (HR of 1.24, 95% CI: 0.71, 2.18; median OS of 10.5 vs. 16.2 months for \natezolizumab and docetaxel, respectively).  \n \nProlonged time to deterioration of patient-reported pain in chest as measured by the EORTC \nQLQ-LC13 was observed with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel (HR of 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49, 1.05; \nmedian not reached in either arm). The time to deterioration in other lung cancer symptoms (i.e. cough, \ndyspnoea, and arm/shoulder pain) as measured by the EORTC QLQ-LC13 was similar between \natezolizumab and docetaxel. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the open-label \ndesign of the study. \n \nPOPLAR (GO28753): Randomised phase II trial in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients \npreviously treated with chemotherapy \n \nA phase II, multi-centre, international, randomised, open-label, controlled study, POPLAR, was \nconducted in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or following \na platinum-containing regimen, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The primary efficacy outcome was \noverall survival. A total of 287 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either atezolizumab (1,200 mg \nby intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until loss of clinical benefit) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 by \nintravenous infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle until disease progression). Randomisation was \nstratified by PD-L1 expression status on IC, by the number of prior chemotherapy regimens and by \nhistology. An updated analysis with a total of 200 deaths observed and a median survival follow-up of \n22 months showed a median OS of 12.6 months in patients treated with atezolizumab, vs. 9.7 months \nin patients treated with docetaxel (HR of 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.92). ORR was 15.3% vs. 14.7% and \nmedian DOR was 18.6 months vs. 7.2 months for atezolizumab vs. docetaxel, respectively.  \n \nSmall cell lung cancer \n \nIMpower133 (GO30081): Randomised phase I/III trial in patients with chemotherapy-naïve extensive-\nstage SCLC, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide \n \nA Phase I/III, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, IMpower133, was \nconducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin and \netoposide in patients with chemotherapy-naïve extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). \n \nPatients were excluded if they had active or untreated CNS metastases; history of autoimmune disease; \nadministration of live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomisation; administration of \nsystemic immunosuppressive medications within 1 week prior to randomisation. Tumour assessments \nwere conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks \nthereafter. Patients who met established criteria and who agreed to be treated beyond disease \nprogression had tumour assessments conducted every 6 weeks until treatment discontinuation. \n \nA total of 403 patients were enrolled and randomised (1:1) to receive one of the treatment regimens \ndescribed in Table 11.  Randomisation was stratified by sex, ECOG performance status, and presence \nof brain metastases.  \n \n\n\n\n73 \n \n \n\nTable 11: Intravenous treatment regimens (IMpower133) \n \n\nTreatment \nregimen \n\nInduction \n(Four 21-Day Cycles) \n\nMaintenance \n(21-Day Cycles) \n\nA atezolizumab (1,200 mg)\na + carboplatin (AUC 5)b + \n\netoposide (100 mg/m2)b,c atezolizumab (1,200 mg)\n a \n\nB placebo + carboplatin (AUC 5)\nb + etoposide (100 \n\nmg/m2)b,c placebo \na Atezolizumab was administered until loss of clinical benefit as assessed by investigator \nb Carboplatin and etoposide were administered until completion of 4 cycles, or progressive disease or \nunacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first \nc Etoposide was administered on day 1, 2 and 3 of each cycle \n \nThe demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were well balanced \nbetween the treatment arms. The median age was 64 years (range: 26 to 90 years) with 10% of patients \n≥75 years of age. The majority of patients were male (65%), white (80%), and 9% had brain \nmetastases and most patients were current or previous smokers (97%). Baseline ECOG performance \nstatus was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%). \n \nAt the time of the primary analysis, patients had a median survival follow up time of 13.9 months. A \nstatistically significant improvement in OS was observed with atezolizumab in combination with \ncarboplatin and etoposide compared to the control arm (HR of 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.91; median OS of \n12.3 months vs. 10.3 months). In the exploratory OS final analysis with longer follow up (median: \n22.9 months), the median OS for both arms was unchanged relative to the primary OS interim analysis. \nThe PFS, ORR and DOR results from the primary analysis as well as the exploratory OS final analysis \nresults are summarized in Table 12.

In study IMpower150, age ≥ 65 was associated with a \ndiminished effect of atezolizumab in patients receiving atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin \nand paclitaxel.  \n \n\n\n\n76 \n \n \n\nIn studies IMpower150 and IMpower133, data for patients ≥75 years of age are too limited to draw \nconclusions on this population.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAn early phase, multi-centre open-label study was conducted in paediatric (<18, n=69) and young \nadult patients (18-30 years, n=18) with relapsed or progressive solid tumours as well as with \nHodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of \natezolizumab. Patients were treated with 15 mg/kg atezolizumab IV every 3 weeks (see section 5.2).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nExposure to atezolizumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg \nincluding the fixed dose 1,200 mg administered every 3 weeks. A population analysis that included \n472 patients described atezolizumab pharmacokinetics for the dose range: 1 to 20 mg/kg with a linear \ntwo-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination. A population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis suggests that steady-state is obtained after 6 to 9 weeks (2 to 3 cycles) of repeated dosing. The \nsystemic accumulation in area under the curve, maximum concentration and trough concentration was \n1.91, 1.46 and 2.75-fold, respectively. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAtezolizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion. There have been no studies performed with \nother routes of administration. \n \nDistribution \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that central compartment volume of distribution is \n3.28 L and volume at steady-state is 6.91 L in the typical patient. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe metabolism of atezolizumab has not been directly studied. Antibodies are cleared principally by \ncatabolism. \n \nElimination \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the clearance of atezolizumab is 0.200 L/day and \nthe typical terminal elimination half-life is 27 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nBased on population PK and exposure-response analyses age (21-89 years), region, ethnicity, renal \nimpairment, mild hepatic impairment, level of PD-L1 expression, or ECOG performance status have \nno effect on atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. Body weight, gender, positive ADA status, albumin \nlevels and tumour burden have a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant effect on \natezolizumab pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustments are recommended. \n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n \n\nElderly \n \nNo dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in elderly patients. The effect of age on the \npharmacokinetics of atezolizumab was assessed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Age was \nnot identified as a significant covariate influencing atezolizumab pharmacokinetics based on patients \nof age range of 21-89 years (n=472), and median of 62 years of age. No clinically important difference \nwas observed in the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab among patients < 65 years (n=274), patients \nbetween 65−75 years (n=152) and patients > 75 years (n=46) (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetic results from one early-phase, multi-centre open-label study that was conducted \nin paediatric (<18 years, n=69) and young adult patients (18-30 years, n=18), show that the clearance \nand volume of distribution of atezolizumab were comparable between paediatric patients receiving \n15 mg/kg and young adult patients receiving 1,200 mg of atezolizumab every 3 weeks when \nnormalized by body weight, with exposure trending lower in paediatric patients as body weight \ndecreased. These differences were not associated with a decrease in atezolizumab concentrations \nbelow the therapeutic target exposure. Data for children <2 years is limited thus no definitive \nconclusions can be made. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. In the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically important differences in the clearance of \natezolizumab were found in patients with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 60 to \n89 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=208) or, moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=116) renal impairment \ncompared to patients with normal (eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=140) renal \nfunction. Only a few patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=8) (see \nsection 4.2). The effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is \nunknown. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. In the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no clinically important differences in the clearance of \natezolizumab between patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or \nbilirubin > 1.0 × to 1.5 × ULN and any AST, n= 71) and normal hepatic function (bilirubin and AST ≤ \nULN, n = 401). No data are available in patients with either moderate or severe hepatic impairment. \nHepatic impairment was defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria of hepatic dysfunction \n(see section 4.2). The effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 × to 3 × ULN \nand any AST or bilirubin > 3 × ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is \nunknown. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of \natezolizumab. \n \nMutagenicity \n \nMutagenicity studies have not been performed to establish the mutagenic potential of atezolizumab. \nHowever, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes.  \n \n\n\n\n78 \n \n \n\nFertility \n \nNo fertility studies have been conducted with atezolizumab; however assessment of the cynomolgus \nmonkey male and female reproductive organs was included in the chronic toxicity study. Weekly \nadministration of atezolizumab to female monkeys at an estimated AUC approximately 6 times the \nAUC in patients receiving the recommended dose caused an irregular menstrual cycle pattern and a \nlack of newly formed corpora lutea in the ovaries which were reversible. There was no effect on the \nmale reproductive organs.  \n \nTeratogenicity  \n \nNo reproductive or teratogenicity studies in animals have been conducted with atezolizumab. Animal \nstudies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to immune-related \nrejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death. Administration of atezolizumab could \ncause foetal harm, including embryo-foetal lethality. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n\n\n94 \n \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nTecentriq 840 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \natezolizumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tecentriq is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Tecentriq \n3. How Tecentriq is given  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Tecentriq \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tecentriq is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Tecentriq is  \n \nTecentriq is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance atezolizumab.  \n• It belongs to a group of medicines called monoclonal antibodies.  \n• A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein designed to recognise and attach to a specific target \n\nin the body. \n• This antibody can help your immune system fight your cancer. \n \nWhat Tecentriq is used for  \n \nTecentriq is used in adults to treat: \n• A kind of bladder cancer, called urothelial carcinoma \n• A kind of lung cancer, called non-small cell lung cancer \n• A kind of breast cancer, called triple negative breast cancer. \n \nPatients get Tecentriq when their cancer has spread to other parts of the body or come back after \nprevious treatment. \n \nTecentriq may be given in combination with other anticancer medicines. It is important that you also \nread the package leaflets for the other anticancer medicines you may be receiving. If you have any \nquestions about these medicines, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n \n \n\nHow Tecentriq works \n \nTecentriq works by attaching to a specific protein in your body called programmed death-ligand 1 \n(PD-L1). This protein suppresses the body’s immune (defense) system, thereby protecting cancer cells \nfrom being attacked by the immune cells. By attaching to the protein, Tecentriq helps your immune \nsystem to fight your cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Tecentriq  \n \nYou must not be given Tecentriq if: \n \n• you are allergic to atezolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tecentriq. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tecentriq if you: \n• have an auto-immune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells) \n• have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain  \n• have any history of inflammation of your lungs (called pneumonitis)  \n• have or have had chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C \n\n(HCV) \n• have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome \n\n(AIDS) \n• have had serious side effects because of other antibody therapies that help your immune system \n\nto fight cancer \n• have been given medicines to stimulate your immune system   \n• have been given medicines to suppress your immune system \n• have been given a live, attenuated vaccine \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are \ngiven Tecentriq. \n \nTecentriq may cause some side effects that you must tell your doctor about straight away. They may \nhappen weeks or months after your last dose. Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the \nsymptoms below: \n• inflammation of the lung (pneumonitis): symptoms may include new or worsening cough, \n\nshortness of breath, and chest pain \n• inflammation of the liver (hepatitis): symptoms may include yellowing of skin or eyes, nausea, \n\nvomiting, bleeding or bruising, dark urine, and stomach pain \n• inflammation of the intestines (colitis): symptoms may include diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft \n\nstools), blood in stools, and stomach pain \n• inflammation of the thyroid, adrenal glands and the pituitary gland (hypothyroidism, \n\nhyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis): symptoms may include tiredness, \nweight loss, weight gain, change in mood, hair loss, constipation, dizziness, headaches, \nincreased thirst, increased urination and changes in vision. \n\n• type 1 diabetes, including acid in the blood produced from diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis): \nsymptoms may include feeling more hungry or thirsty than usual, need to urinate more often, \nweight loss, and feeling tired \n\n• inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or inflammation of the membrane around the spinal \ncord and brain (meningitis): symptoms may include neck stiffness, headache, fever, chills, \nvomiting, eye sensitivity to light, confusion and sleepiness  \n\n\n\n96 \n \n \n\n• inflammation or problems of the nerves (neuropathy): symptoms may include muscle weakness \nand numbness, tingling in hands and feet \n\n• inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis): symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea and \nvomiting \n\n• inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis): symptoms may include shortness of breath, \ndecreased exercise tolerance, feeling tired, chest pain, swelling of the ankles or legs, irregular \nheartbeat, and fainting \n\n• inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis); symptoms may include changes in urine output and \ncolor, pain in pelvis, and swelling of the body and may lead to failure of the kidneys \n\n• severe reactions associated with infusion (events occurring during the infusion or within one \nday of the infusion): may include fever, chills, shortness of breath and flushing. \n\n \nIf you notice any of the symptoms above, tell your doctor straight away. \n \nDo not try to treat yourself with other medicines. Your doctor may: \n• Give you other medicines to prevent complications and reduce symptoms. \n• Delay giving your next dose of Tecentriq. \n• Stop your treatment with Tecentriq. \n \nTests and checks \n \nBefore your treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have blood tests \nduring your treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThis medicine should not be given to children or adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because \nthe safety and efficacy of Tecentriq have not been established in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Tecentriq \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThis includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. \n \nPregnancy and contraception \n \n• Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to become \n\npregnant. \n• You will not be given Tecentriq if you are pregnant unless your doctor considers it necessary. \n\nThis is because the effect of Tecentriq in pregnant women is not known - it is possible that it \ncould harm your unborn baby. \n\n• If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception; \n- while you are being treated with Tecentriq and  \n- for 5 months after the last dose. \n\n• If you become pregnant while you are being treated with Tecentriq tell your doctor. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known if Tecentriq gets into breast milk. Ask your doctor if you should stop breast-feeding or \nif you should stop treatment with Tecentriq. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTecentriq has minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. If you feel tired, do not drive \nor use machines until you feel better. \n\n\n\n97 \n \n \n\n \n \n3. How Tecentriq is given \n \nYou will be given Tecentriq by a doctor experienced in cancer treatment in a hospital or clinic.  \n \nHow much Tecentriq is given \n \nThe recommended dose is either: \n• 840 milligrams (mg) every two weeks, or \n• 1,680 milligrams (mg) every four weeks. \n \nHow Tecentriq is given \n \nTecentriq is given as a drip into a vein (an intravenous infusion).  \n \nYour first infusion will be given over 60 minutes.  \n• Your doctor will monitor you carefully during the first infusion.  \n• If you do not have an infusion reaction during the first infusion, the next infusions will be given \n\nto you over a period of 30 minutes.  \n \nHow long treatment lasts \n \nYour doctor will keep giving you Tecentriq until you no longer benefit from it. However, it may be \nstopped if the side effects become too much of a problem. \n \nIf you miss a dose of Tecentriq \n \nIf you miss an appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it \nis very important to keep having the infusions.  \n \nIf you stop receiving Tecentriq \n \nDo not stop treatment with Tecentriq unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because \nstopping treatment may stop the effect of the medicine. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the side effects below or if they get worse. They \nmay happen weeks or months after your last dose.

Once the infusion is \nprepared it should be administered immediately. \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulates and discolouration prior to \nadministration. If particulates or discoloration are observed, the solution should not be used.  \n \nNo incompatibilities have been observed between Tecentriq and intravenous bags with \nproduct-contacting surfaces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyolefin (PO), polyethylene (PE), or \npolypropylene (PP). In addition, no incompatibilities have been observed with in-line filter membranes \ncomposed of polyethersulfone or polysulfone, and infusion sets and other infusion aids composed of \nPVC, PE, polybutadiene, or polyetherurethane. The use of in-line filter membranes is optional. \n \nDiluted solution \n \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 24 hours at ≤ 30 °C and for up \nto 30 days at 2°C to 8°C from the time of preparation.  \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the prepared solution for infusion should be used immediately. \nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \nuser and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C or 8 hours at ambient temperature \n(≤ 25 °C), unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nTecentriq is for intravenous use. The infusions must not be administered as an intravenous push or \nbolus. \n \nThe initial dose of Tecentriq must be administered over 60 minutes. If the first infusion is well \ntolerated all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. \n \nDo not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line. \n \nDisposal \n \nThe release of Tecentriq in the environment should be minimised. Any unused medicinal product or \nwaste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\n104 \n \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nTecentriq 1,200 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \natezolizumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tecentriq is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Tecentriq \n3. How Tecentriq is given  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Tecentriq \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tecentriq is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Tecentriq is  \n \nTecentriq is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance atezolizumab.  \n• It belongs to a group of medicines called monoclonal antibodies.  \n• A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein designed to recognise and attach to a specific target \n\nin the body. \n• This antibody can help your immune system fight your cancer.  \n \nWhat Tecentriq is used for  \n \nTecentriq is used in adults to treat: \n• A kind of bladder cancer, called urothelial carcinoma \n• A kind of lung cancer, called non-small cell lung cancer \n• A kind of lung cancer, called small cell lung cancer \n \nPatients get Tecentriq when their cancer has spread to other parts of the body or come back after \nprevious treatment. \n \nTecentriq may be given in combination with other anticancer medicines. It is important that you also \nread the package leaflets for the other anticancer medicines you may be receiving. If you have any \nquestions about these medicines, ask your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n105 \n \n \n\nHow Tecentriq works \n \nTecentriq works by attaching to a specific protein in your body called programmed death-ligand 1 \n(PD-L1). This protein suppresses the body’s immune (defense) system, thereby protecting cancer cells \nfrom being attacked by the immune cells. By attaching to the protein, Tecentriq helps your immune \nsystem to fight your cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Tecentriq  \n \nYou must not be given Tecentriq if: \n \n• you are allergic to atezolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tecentriq. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tecentriq if you: \n• have an auto-immune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells) \n• have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain  \n• have any history of inflammation of your lungs (called pneumonitis)  \n• have or have had chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C \n\n(HCV) \n• have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome \n\n(AIDS) \n• have had serious side effects because of other antibody therapies that help your immune system \n\nto fight cancer \n• have been given medicines to stimulate your immune system   \n• have been given medicines to suppress your immune system \n• have been given a live, attenuated vaccine \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are \ngiven Tecentriq. \n \nTecentriq may cause some side effects that you must tell your doctor about straight away. They may \nhappen weeks or months after your last dose. Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the \nsymptoms below: \n• inflammation of the lung (pneumonitis): symptoms may include new or worsening cough, \n\nshortness of breath, and chest pain \n• inflammation of the liver (hepatitis): symptoms may include yellowing of skin or eyes, nausea, \n\nvomiting, bleeding or bruising, dark urine, and stomach pain \n• inflammation of the intestines (colitis): symptoms may include diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft \n\nstools), blood in stools, and stomach pain \n• inflammation of the thyroid, adrenal glands and the pituitary gland (hypothyroidism, \n\nhyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis): symptoms may include tiredness, \nweight loss, weight gain, change in mood, hair loss, constipation, dizziness, headaches, \nincreased thirst, increased urination and changes in vision. \n\n• type 1 diabetes, including acid in the blood produced from diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis): \nsymptoms may include feeling more hungry or thirsty than usual, need to urinate more often, \nweight loss, and feeling tired \n\n• inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or inflammation of the membrane around the spinal \ncord and brain (meningitis): symptoms may include neck stiffness, headache, fever, chills, \nvomiting, eye sensitivity to light, confusion and sleepiness  \n\n\n\n106 \n \n \n\n• inflammation or problems of the nerves (neuropathy): symptoms may include muscle weakness \nand numbness, tingling in hands and feet \n\n• inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis): symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea and \nvomiting \n\n• inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis): symptoms may include shortness of breath, \ndecreased exercise tolerance, feeling tired, chest pain, swelling of the ankles or legs, irregular \nheartbeat, and fainting \n\n• inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis); symptoms may include changes in urine output and \ncolor, pain in pelvis, and swelling of the body and may lead to failure of the kidneys \n\n• severe reactions associated with infusion (events occurring during the infusion or within one \nday of the infusion): may include fever, chills, shortness of breath and flushing. \n\n \nIf you notice any of the symptoms above, tell your doctor straight away. \n \nDo not try to treat yourself with other medicines. Your doctor may: \n• Give you other medicines to prevent complications and reduce symptoms. \n• Delay giving your next dose of Tecentriq. \n• Stop your treatment with Tecentriq. \n \nTests and checks \n \nBefore your treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have blood tests \nduring your treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThis medicine should not be given to children or adolescents below 18 years of age. This is because \nthe safety and efficacy of Tecentriq have not been established in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Tecentriq \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThis includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. \n \nPregnancy and contraception \n \n• Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to become \n\npregnant. \n• You will not be given Tecentriq if you are pregnant unless your doctor considers it necessary. \n\nThis is because the effect of Tecentriq in pregnant women is not known - it is possible that it \ncould harm your unborn baby. \n\n• If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception; \n- while you are being treated with Tecentriq and  \n- for 5 months after the last dose. \n\n• If you become pregnant while you are being treated with Tecentriq tell your doctor. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known if Tecentriq gets into breast milk. Ask your doctor if you should stop breast-feeding or \nif you should stop treatment with Tecentriq. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nTecentriq has minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. If you feel tired, do not drive \nor use machines until you feel better. \n\n\n\n107 \n \n \n\n \n \n3. How Tecentriq is given \n \nYou will be given Tecentriq by a doctor experienced in cancer treatment in a hospital or clinic.  \n \nHow much Tecentriq is given \n \nThe recommended dose is 1,200 milligrams (mg) every three weeks. \n \nHow Tecentriq is given \n \nTecentriq is given as a drip into a vein (an intravenous infusion).  \n \nYour first infusion will be given over 60 minutes.  \n• Your doctor will monitor you carefully during the first infusion.  \n• If you do not have an infusion reaction during the first infusion, the next infusions will be given \n\nto you over a period of 30 minutes.  \n \nHow long treatment lasts \n \nYour doctor will keep giving you Tecentriq until you no longer benefit from it. However, it may be \nstopped if the side effects become too much of a problem. \n \nIf you miss a dose of Tecentriq \n \nIf you miss an appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it \nis very important to keep having the infusions.  \n \nIf you stop receiving Tecentriq \n \nDo not stop treatment with Tecentriq unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because \nstopping treatment may stop the effect of the medicine. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the side effects below or if they get worse.

After dilution, the final concentration of the \ndiluted solution should be between 3.2 and 16.8 mg/mL. The bag should be gently inverted to mix the \nsolution in order to avoid foaming. Once the infusion is prepared it should be administered \nimmediately. \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulates and discolouration prior to \nadministration. If particulates or discoloration are observed, the solution should not be used.  \n \nNo incompatibilities have been observed between Tecentriq and intravenous bags with \nproduct-contacting surfaces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyolefin (PO), polyethylene (PE), or \npolypropylene (PP). In addition, no incompatibilities have been observed with in-line filter membranes \ncomposed of polyethersulfone or polysulfone, and infusion sets and other infusion aids composed of \nPVC, PE, polybutadiene, or polyetherurethane. The use of in-line filter membranes is optional. \n \nDiluted solution \n \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 24 hours at ≤ 30 °C and for up \nto 30 days at 2 °C to 8 °C from the time of preparation.  \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the prepared solution for infusion should be used immediately. \nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \nuser and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C or 8 hours at ambient temperature \n(≤ 25 °C), unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nTecentriq is for intravenous use. The infusions must not be administered as an intravenous push or \nbolus. \n \nThe initial dose of Tecentriq must be administered over 60 minutes. If the first infusion is well \ntolerated all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. \n \nDo not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line. \n \nDisposal \n \nThe release of Tecentriq in the environment should be minimised. Any unused medicinal product or \nwaste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
