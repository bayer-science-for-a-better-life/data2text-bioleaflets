QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach tablet contains 50 mg of vildagliptin. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect: Each tablet contains 47.82 mg lactose (anhydrous). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nTablet. \n\n \n\nWhite to light yellowish, round (8 mm diameter), flat-faced, bevelled-edge tablet. One side is \n\ndebossed with \u201cNVR\u201d, and the other side with \u201cFB\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nVildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults: \n\n \n\nAs monotherapy \n\n- in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is \n\ninappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. \n\n \n\nAs dual oral therapy in combination with \n\n- metformin, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of \n\nmonotherapy with metformin, \n\n- a sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose \n\nof a sulphonylurea and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or \n\nintolerance, \n\n- a thiazolidinedione, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control and for whom the use of a \n\nthiazolidinedione is appropriate. \n\n \n\nAs triple oral therapy in combination with \n\n- a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal \nproducts do not provide adequate glycaemic control. \n\n \nVildagliptin is also indicated for use in combination with insulin (with or without metformin) when \n\ndiet and exercise plus a stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nWhen used as monotherapy, in combination with metformin, in combination with thiazolidinedione, in \n\ncombination with metformin and a sulphonylurea, or in combination with insulin (with or without \n\nmetformin), the recommended daily dose of vildagliptin is 100 mg, administered as one dose of 50 mg \n\nin the morning and one dose of 50 mg in the evening. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nWhen used in dual combination with a sulphonylurea, the recommended dose of vildagliptin is 50 mg \n\nonce daily administered in the morning. In this patient population, vildagliptin 100 mg daily was no \n\nmore effective than vildagliptin 50 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nWhen used in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be considered \n\nto reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nDoses higher than 100 mg are not recommended. \n\n \n\nIf a dose of Jalra is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose should \n\nnot be taken on the same day. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of vildagliptin as triple oral therapy in combination with metformin and a \n\nthiazolidinedione have not been established. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on special populations \n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \n\nNo dose adjustments are necessary in elderly patients (see also sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n\n\u2265 50 ml/min). In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or with end-stage renal disease \n\n(ESRD), the recommended dose of Jalra is 50 mg once daily (see also sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nJalra should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment, including patients with pre-treatment \n\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3x the upper limit of normal \n\n(ULN) (see also sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nJalra is not recommended for use in children and adolescents (< 18 years). The safety and efficacy of \n\nJalra in children and adolescents (< 18 years) have not been established. No data are available (see \n\nalso section 5.1). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use \n\nJalra can be administered with or without a meal (see also section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nJalra is not a substitute for insulin in insulin-requiring patients. Jalra should not be used in patients \n\nwith type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience in patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. Therefore Jalra should be used \n\nwith caution in these patients (see also sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nJalra should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment, including patients with pre-treatment \n\nALT or AST > 3x ULN (see also sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nLiver enzyme monitoring \n\n \n\nRare cases of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatitis) have been reported. In these cases, the patients \n\nwere generally asymptomatic without clinical sequelae and liver function test results returned to \n\nnormal after discontinuation of treatment. Liver function tests should be performed prior to the \n\ninitiation of treatment with Jalra in order to know the patient\u2019s baseline value. Liver function should \n\nbe monitored during treatment with Jalra at three-month intervals during the first year and periodically \n\nthereafter. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored with a second \n\nliver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver function \n\ntests until the abnormality(ies) return(s) to normal. Should an increase in AST or ALT of 3x ULN or \n\ngreater persist, withdrawal of Jalra therapy is recommended. \n\n \n\nPatients who develop jaundice or other signs suggestive of liver dysfunction should discontinue Jalra. \n\n \n\nFollowing withdrawal of treatment with Jalra and LFT normalisation, treatment with Jalra should not \n\nbe reinitiated. \n\n \n\nCardiac failure \n\n \n\nA clinical trial of vildagliptin in patients with New York Heart Association NYHA functional \n\nclass I-III showed that treatment with vildagliptin was not associated with a change in left-ventricular \n\nfunction or worsening of pre-existing congestive heart failure (CHF) versus placebo. Clinical \n\nexperience in patients with NYHA functional class III treated with vildagliptin is still limited and \n\nresults are inconclusive (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThere is no experience of vildagliptin use in clinical trials in patients with NYHA functional class IV \n\nand therefore use is not recommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nSkin disorders \n\n \n\nSkin lesions, including blistering and ulceration have been reported in extremities of monkeys in non-\n\nclinical toxicology studies (see section 5.3). Although skin lesions were not observed at an increased \n\nincidence in clinical trials, there was limited experience in patients with diabetic skin complications. \n\nFurthermore, there have been post-marketing reports of bullous and exfoliative skin lesions. \n\nTherefore, in keeping with routine care of the diabetic patient, monitoring for skin disorders, such as \n\nblistering or ulceration, is recommended. \n\n \n\nAcute pancreatitis \n\n \n\nUse of vildagliptin has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients should be \n\ninformed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis. \n\n \n\nIf pancreatitis is suspected, vildagliptin should be discontinued if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, \n\nvildagliptin should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with history of acute \n\npancreatitis. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\n \n\nSulphonylureas are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Patients receiving vildagliptin in combination \n\nwith a sulphonylurea may be at risk for hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of sulphonylurea may \n\nbe considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nVildagliptin has a low potential for interactions with co-administered medicinal products. Since \n\nvildagliptin is not a cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme substrate and does not inhibit or induce CYP \n\n450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with active substances that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers \n\nof these enzymes. \n\n \n\nCombination with pioglitazone, metformin and glyburide \n\n \n\nResults from studies conducted with these oral antidiabetics have shown no clinically relevant \n\npharmacokinetic interactions. \n\n \n\nDigoxin (Pgp substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) \n\n \n\nClinical studies performed with healthy subjects have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic \n\ninteractions. However, this has not been established in the target population. \n\n \n\nCombination with amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan or simvastatin \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted with amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan \n\nand simvastatin. In these studies, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed \n\nafter co-administration with vildagliptin. \n\n \n\nCombination with ACE-inhibitors \n\n \n\nThere may be an increased risk of angioedema in patients concomitantly taking ACE-inhibitors.(see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nAs with other oral antidiabetic medicinal products the hypoglycaemic effect of vildagliptin may be \n\nreduced by certain active substances, including thiazides, corticosteroids, thyroid products and \n\nsympathomimetics. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of vildagliptin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nDue to lack of human data, Jalra should not be used during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether vildagliptin is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of \n\nvildagliptin in milk. Jalra should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for Jalra (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients who \n\nexperience dizziness as an adverse reaction should avoid driving vehicles or using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nSafety data were obtained from a total of 3,784 patients exposed to vildagliptin at a daily dose of \n\n50 mg (once daily) or 100 mg (50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily) in controlled trials of at least \n\n12 weeks duration. Of these patients, 2,264 patients received vildagliptin as monotherapy and \n\n1,520 patients received vildagliptin in combination with another medicinal product. 2,682 patients \n\nwere treated with vildagliptin 100 mg daily (either 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily) and \n\n1,102 patients were treated with vildagliptin 50 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nThe majority of adverse reactions in these trials were mild and transient, not requiring treatment \n\ndiscontinuations. No association was found between adverse reactions and age, ethnicity, duration of \n\nexposure or daily dose. \n\n \n\nRare cases of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatitis) have been reported. In these cases, the patients \n\nwere generally asymptomatic without clinical sequelae and liver function returned to normal after \n\ndiscontinuation of treatment. In data from controlled monotherapy and add-on therapy trials of up to \n\n24 weeks in duration, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations \uf0b3 3x ULN (classified as present on at \n\nleast 2 consecutive measurements or at the final on-treatment visit) was 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.2% for \n\nvildagliptin 50 mg once daily, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily and all comparators, respectively. These \n\nelevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, non-progressive in nature and not \n\nassociated with cholestasis or jaundice. \n\n \n\nRare cases of angioedema have been reported on vildagliptin at a similar rate to controls. A greater \n\nproportion of cases were reported when vildagliptin was administered in combination with an \n\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-Inhibitor). The majority of events were mild in \n\nseverity and resolved with ongoing vildagliptin treatment. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions reported in patients who received Jalra in double-blind studies as monotherapy and \n\nadd-on therapies are listed below for each indication by system organ class and absolute frequency. \n\nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n\n<1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCombination with metformin \n\n \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported in patients who received Jalra 100 mg daily in \n\ncombination with metformin in double-blind studies (N=208) \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\n Common Hypoglycaemia \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common Tremor \n\n Common Headache \n\n Common Dizziness \n\n Uncommon Fatigue \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common Nausea \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nIn controlled clinical trials with the combination of vildagliptin 100 mg daily + metformin, no \n\nwithdrawal due to adverse reactions was reported in either the vildagliptin 100 mg daily + metformin \n\nor the placebo + metformin treatment groups. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was common in patients receiving vildagliptin \n\n100 mg daily in combination with metformin (1%) and uncommon in patients receiving placebo + \n\nmetformin (0.4%).

It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nInformation regarding overdose with vildagliptin is limited. \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nInformation on the likely symptoms of overdose was taken from a rising dose tolerability study in \n\nhealthy subjects given Jalra for 10 days. At 400 mg, there were three cases of muscle pain, and \n\nindividual cases of mild and transient paraesthesia, fever, oedema and a transient increase in lipase \n\nlevels. At 600 mg, one subject experienced oedema of the feet and hands, and increases in creatine \n\nphosphokinase (CPK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin \n\nlevels. Three other subjects experienced oedema of the feet, with paraesthesia in two cases. All \n\nsymptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved without treatment after discontinuation of the study \n\nmedicinal product. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nIn the event of an overdose, supportive management is recommended. Vildagliptin cannot be removed \n\nby haemodialysis. However, the major hydrolysis metabolite (LAY 151) can be removed by \n\nhaemodialysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, ATC \n\ncode: A10BH02 \n\n \n\nVildagliptin, a member of the islet enhancer class, is a potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitor. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nThe administration of vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity, \n\nresulting in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 \n\n(glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nBy increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, vildagliptin enhances the sensitivity \n\nof beta cells to glucose, resulting in improved glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Treatment with \n\nvildagliptin 50-100 mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly improved markers of beta \n\ncell function including HOMA-\uf062 (Homeostasis Model Assessment\u2013\uf062), proinsulin to insulin ratio and \n\nmeasures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test. In non-diabetic \n\n(normal glycaemic) individuals, vildagliptin does not stimulate insulin secretion or reduce glucose \n\nlevels. \n\n \n\nBy increasing endogenous GLP-1 levels, vildagliptin also enhances the sensitivity of alpha cells to \n\nglucose, resulting in more glucose-appropriate glucagon secretion. \n\n \n\nThe enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin \n\nhormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to \n\nreduced glycaemia. \n\n \n\nThe known effect of increased GLP-1 levels delaying gastric emptying is not observed with \n\nvildagliptin treatment. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nMore than 15,000 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in double-blind placebo- or active-\n\ncontrolled clinical trials of up to more than 2 years\u2019 treatment duration. In these studies, vildagliptin \n\nwas administered to more than 9,000 patients at daily doses of 50 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily or \n\n100 mg once daily. More than 5,000 male and more than 4,000 female patients received vildagliptin \n\n50 mg once daily or 100 mg daily. More than 1,900 patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg once daily or \n\n100 mg daily were \u2265 65 years. In these trials, vildagliptin was administered as monotherapy in drug-\n\nna\u00efve patients with type 2 diabetes or in combination in patients not adequately controlled by other \n\nantidiabetic medicinal products. \n\n \n\nOverall, vildagliptin improved glycaemic control when given as monotherapy or when used in \n\ncombination with metformin, a sulphonylurea, and a thiazolidinedione, as measured by clinically \n\nrelevant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at study endpoint (see Table 8). \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, the magnitude of HbA1c reductions with vildagliptin was greater in patients with \n\nhigher baseline HbA1c. \n\n \n\nIn a 52-week double-blind controlled trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) reduced baseline HbA1c \n\nby -1% compared to -1.6% for metformin (titrated to 2 g/day) statistical non-inferiority was not \n\nachieved. Patients treated with vildagliptin reported significantly lower incidences of gastrointestinal \n\nadverse reactions versus those treated with metformin. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nIn a 24-week double-blind controlled trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to \n\nrosiglitazone (8 mg once daily). Mean reductions were -1.20% with vildagliptin and -1.48% with \n\nrosiglitazone in patients with mean baseline HbA1c of 8.7%. Patients receiving rosiglitazone \n\nexperienced a mean increase in weight (+1.6 kg) while those receiving vildagliptin experienced no \n\nweight gain (-0.3 kg). The incidence of peripheral oedema was lower in the vildagliptin group than in \n\nthe rosiglitazone group (2.1% vs. 4.1% respectively). \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial of 2 years\u2019 duration, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to gliclazide (up \n\nto 320 mg/day). After two years, mean reduction in HbA1c was -0.5% for vildagliptin and -0.6% for \n\ngliclazide, from a mean baseline HBA1c of 8.6%. Statistical non-inferiority was not achieved. \n\nVildagliptin was associated with fewer hypoglycaemic events (0.7%) than gliclazide (1.7%). \n\n \n\nIn a 24-week trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to pioglitazone (30 mg once daily) \n\nin patients inadequately controlled with metformin (mean daily dose: 2020 mg). Mean reductions from \n\nbaseline HbA1c of 8.4% were -0.9% with vildagliptin added to metformin and -1.0% with pioglitazone \n\nadded to metformin. A mean weight gain of +1.9 kg was observed in patients receiving pioglitazone \n\nadded to metformin compared to +0.3 kg in those receiving vildagliptin added to metformin. \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial of 2 years\u2019 duration, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to glimepiride \n\n(up to 6 mg/day \u2013 mean dose at 2 years: 4.6 mg) in patients treated with metformin (mean daily dose: \n\n1894 mg). After 1 year mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.4% with vildagliptin added to metformin \n\nand -0.5% with glimepiride added to metformin, from a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.3%. Body weight \n\nchange with vildagliptin was -0.2 kg vs +1.6 kg with glimepiride. The incidence of hypoglycaemia \n\nwas significantly lower in the vildagliptin group (1.7%) than in the glimepiride group (16.2%). At \n\nstudy endpoint (2 years), the HbA1c was similar to baseline values in both treatment groups and the \n\nbody weight changes and hypoglycaemia differences were maintained. \n\n \n\nIn a 52-week trial, vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was compared to gliclazide (mean daily dose: \n\n229.5 mg) in patients inadequately controlled with metformin (metformin dose at baseline \n\n1928 mg/day). After 1 year, mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.81% with vildagliptin added to \n\nmetformin (mean baseline HbA1c 8.4%) and -0.85% with gliclazide added to metformin (mean \n\nbaseline HbA1c 8.5%); statistical non-inferiority was achieved (95% CI -0.11 \u2013 0.20). Body weight \n\nchange with vildagliptin was +0.1 kg compared to a weight gain of +1.4 kg with gliclazide. \n\n \n\nIn a 24-week trial the efficacy of the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin and metformin (gradually \n\ntitrated to a dose of 50 mg/500 mg twice daily or 50 mg/1000 mg twice daily) as initial therapy in \n\ndrug-na\u00efve patients was evaluated. Vildagliptin/metformin 50 mg/1000 mg twice daily reduced HbA1c \n\nby -1.82%, vildagliptin/metformin 50 mg/500 mg twice daily by -1.61%, metformin 1000 mg twice \n\ndaily by -1.36% and vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily by -1.09% from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.6%. \n\nThe decrease in HbA1c observed in patients with a baseline \u226510.0% was greater. \n\n \n\nA 24-week, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate \n\nthe treatment effect of vildagliptin 50 mg once daily compared to placebo in 515 patients with type 2 \n\ndiabetes and moderate renal impairment (N=294) or severe renal impairment (N=221). 68.8% and \n\n80.5% of the patients with moderate and severe renal impairment respectively were treated with \n\ninsulin (mean daily dose of 56 units and 51.6 units respectively) at baseline. In patients with moderate \n\nrenal impairment vildagliptin significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo (difference \n\nof -0.53%) from a mean baseline of 7.9%. In patients with severe renal impairment, vildagliptin \n\nsignificantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo (difference of -0.56%) from a mean baseline of \n\n7.7%. \n\n \n\nA 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 318 patients to \n\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with metformin \n\n(\u22651500 mg daily) and glimepiride (\u22654 mg daily). Vildagliptin in combination with metformin and \n\nglimepiride significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo.The placebo-adjusted mean \n\nreduction from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.8% was -0.76%. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nA 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 449 patients to \n\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with a stable dose \n\nof basal or premixed insulin (mean daily dose 41 units), with concomitant use of metformin (N=276) \n\nor without concomitant metformin (N=173). Vildagliptin in combination with insulin significantly \n\ndecreased HbA1c compared with placebo. In the overall population, the placebo-adjusted mean \n\nreduction from a mean baseline HbA1c 8.8% was -0.72%. In the subgroups treated with insulin with or \n\nwithout concomitant metformin the placebo-adjusted mean reduction in HbA1c was -0.63% \n\nand -0.84%, respectively. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the overall population was 8.4% and \n\n7.2% in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Patients receiving vildagliptin experienced \n\nno weight gain (+0.2 kg) while those receiving placebo experienced weight reduction (-0.7 kg). \n\n \n\nIn another 24-week study in patients with more advanced type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on \n\ninsulin (short and longer acting, average insulin dose 80 IU/day), the mean reduction in HbA1c when \n\nvildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was added to insulin was statistically significantly greater than with \n\nplacebo plus insulin (0.5% vs. 0.2%). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the vildagliptin \n\ngroup than in the placebo group (22.9% vs. 29.6%). \n\n \n\nA 52-week multi-centre, randomised, double-blind trial was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes \n\nand congestive heart failure (NYHA functional class I-III) to evaluate the effect of vildagliptin 50 mg \n\ntwice daily (N=128) compared to placebo (N=126) on left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). \n\nVildagliptin was not associated with a change in left-ventricular function or worsening of pre-existing \n\nCHF. Adjudicated cardiovascular events were balanced overall. There were more cardiac events in \n\nvildagliptin treated patients with NYHA class III heart failure compared to placebo. However, there \n\nwere imbalances in baseline cardiovascular risk favouring placebo and the number of events was low, \n\nprecluding firm conclusions. Vildagliptin significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo \n\n(difference of 0.6%) from a mean baseline of 7.8% at week 16. In the subgroup with NYHA class III, \n\nthe decrease in HbA1c compared to placebo was lower (difference 0.3%) but this conclusion is limited \n\nby the small number of patients (n=44). The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the overall population was \n\n4.7% and 5.6% in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular risk \n\nA meta-analysis of independently and prospectively adjudicated cardiovascular events from 37 phase \n\nIII and IV monotherapy and combination therapy clinical studies of up to more than 2 years duration \n\n(mean exposure 50 weeks for vildagliptin and 49 weeks for comparators) was performed and showed \n\nthat vildagliptin treatment was not associated with  an increase in cardiovascular risk versus \n\ncomparators. The composite endpoint of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) \n\nincluding acute myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death was similar for vildagliptin \n\nversus combined active and placebo comparators [Mantel\u2013Haenszel risk ratio (M-H RR) 0.82 (95% CI \n\n0.61-1.11)]. A MACE occurred in 83 out of 9,599 (0.86%) vildagliptin-treated patients and in 85 out \n\nof 7,102 (1.20%) comparator-treated patients. Assessment of each individual MACE component \n\nshowed no increased risk (similar M-H RR). Confirmed heart failure (HF) events defined as HF \n\nrequiring hospitalisation or new onset of HF were reported in 41 (0.43%) vildagliptin-treated patients \n\nand 32 (0.45%) comparator-treated patients with M-H RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.68-1.70). \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nTable 8 Key efficacy results of vildagliptin in placebo-controlled monotherapy trials and in \n\nadd-on combination therapy trials (primary efficacy ITT population) \n\n \n\nMonotherapy placebo \n\ncontrolled studies \n\nMean \n\nbaseline \n\nHbA1c (%) \n\nMean change \n\nfrom baseline in \n\nHbA1c (%) at \n\nweek 24 \n\nPlacebo-corrected mean \n\nchange in HbA1c (%) at \n\nweek 24 (95% CI) \n\nStudy 2301: Vildagliptin 50 mg \n\ntwice daily (N=90) \n\n8.6 -0.8 -0.5* (-0.8, -0.1) \n\nStudy 2384: Vildagliptin 50 mg \n\ntwice daily (N=79) \n\n8.4 -0.7 -0.7* (-1.1, -0.4) \n\n  * p< 0.05 for comparison versus placebo \n\nAdd-on / Combination studies    \n\nVildagliptin 50 mg twice daily + \n\nmetformin (N=143) \n\n8.4 -0.9 -1.1* (-1.4, -0.8) \n\nVildagliptin 50 mg daily + \n\nglimepiride (N=132) \n\n8.5 -0.6 -0.6* (-0.9, -0.4) \n\nVildagliptin 50 mg twice daily + \n\npioglitazone (N=136) \n\n8.7 -1.0 -0.7* (-0.9, -0.4) \n\nVildagliptin 50 mg twice daily + \n\nmetformin + glimepiride (N=152) \n\n8.8 -1.0 -0.8* (-1.0, -0.5) \n\n  * p< 0.05 for comparison versus placebo + \n\ncomparator \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nvildagliptin in all subsets of the paediatric population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration in the fasting state, vildagliptin is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma \n\nconcentrations observed at 1.7 hours. Food slightly delays the time to peak plasma concentration to \n\n2.5 hours, but does not alter the overall exposure (AUC). Administration of vildagliptin with food \n\nresulted in a decreased Cmax (19%). However, the magnitude of change is not clinically significant, so \n\nthat Jalra can be given with or without food. The absolute bioavailability is 85%. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe plasma protein binding of vildagliptin is low (9.3%) and vildagliptin distributes equally between \n\nplasma and red blood cells. The mean volume of distribution of vildagliptin at steady-state after \n\nintravenous administration (Vss) is 71 litres, suggesting extravascular distribution. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nMetabolism is the major elimination pathway for vildagliptin in humans, accounting for 69% of the \n\ndose. The major metabolite (LAY 151) is pharmacologically inactive and is the hydrolysis product of \n\nthe cyano moiety, accounting for 57% of the dose, followed by the glucuronide (BQS867) and the \n\namide hydrolysis products (4% of dose). In vitro data in human kidney microsomes suggest that the \n\nkidney may be one of the major organs contributing to the hydrolysis of vildagliptin to its major \n\ninactive metabolite, LAY151. DPP-4 contributes partially to the hydrolysis of vildagliptin based on an \n\nin vivo study using DPP-4 deficient rats. Vildagliptin is not metabolised by CYP 450 enzymes to any \n\nquantifiable extent. Accordingly, the metabolic clearance of vildagliptin is not anticipated to be \n\naffected by co-medications that are CYP 450 inhibitors and/or inducers. In vitro studies demonstrated \n\n\n\n15 \n\nthat vildagliptin does not inhibit/induce CYP 450 enzymes. Therefore, vildagliptin is not likely to \n\naffect metabolic clearance of co-medications metabolised by CYP 1A2, CYP 2C8, CYP 2C9, CYP \n\n2C19, CYP 2D6, CYP 2E1 or CYP 3A4/5. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration of [14C] vildagliptin, approximately 85% of the dose was excreted into \n\nthe urine and 15% of the dose is recovered in the faeces. Renal excretion of the unchanged vildagliptin \n\naccounted for 23% of the dose after oral administration. After intravenous administration to healthy \n\nsubjects, the total plasma and renal clearances of vildagliptin are 41 and 13 l/h, respectively. The mean \n\nelimination half-life after intravenous administration is approximately 2 hours. The elimination half-\n\nlife after oral administration is approximately 3 hours. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe Cmax for vildagliptin and the area under the plasma concentrations versus time curves (AUC) \n\nincreased in an approximately dose proportional manner over the therapeutic dose range. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in specific groups of patients \n\n \n\nGender \n\nNo clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin were observed between male \n\nand female healthy subjects within a wide range of age and body mass index (BMI). DPP-4 inhibition \n\nby vildagliptin is not affected by gender. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIn healthy elderly subjects (\u2265 70 years), the overall exposure of vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) was \n\nincreased by 32%, with an 18% increase in peak plasma concentration as compared to young healthy \n\nsubjects (18-40 years). These changes are, however, not considered to be clinically relevant. DPP-4 \n\ninhibition by vildagliptin is not affected by age. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe effect of impaired hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin was studied in patients \n\nwith mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment based on the Child-Pugh scores (ranging from 6 \n\nfor mild to 12 for severe) in comparison with healthy subjects. The exposure to vildagliptin after a \n\nsingle dose in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was decreased (20% and 8%, \n\nrespectively), while the exposure to vildagliptin for patients with severe impairment was increased by \n\n22%. The maximum change (increase or decrease) in the exposure to vildagliptin is ~30%, which is \n\nnot considered to be clinically relevant. There was no correlation between the severity of the hepatic \n\ndisease and changes in the exposure to vildagliptin. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA multiple-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the lower \n\ntherapeutic dose of vildagliptin (50 mg once daily) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal \n\nimpairment defined by creatinine clearance (mild: 50 to <80 ml/min, moderate: 30 to <50 ml/min and \n\nsevere: <30 ml/min) compared to normal healthy control subjects. \n\n \n\nVildagliptin AUC increased on average 1.4, 1.7 and 2-fold in patients with mild, moderate and severe \n\nrenal impairment, respectively, compared to normal healthy subjects. AUC of the metabolites \n\nLAY151 and BQS867 increased on average about 1.5, 3 and 7-fold in patients with mild, moderate \n\nand severe renal impairment, respectively. Limited data from patients with end stage renal disease \n\n(ESRD) indicate that vildagliptin exposure is similar to that in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\nLAY151 concentrations were approximately 2-3-fold higher than in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment. \n\n \n\nVildagliptin was removed by haemodialysis to a limited extent (3% over a 3-4 hour haemodialysis \n\nsession starting 4 hours post dose). \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nEthnic group \n\nLimited data suggest that race does not have any major influence on vildagliptin pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIntra-cardiac impulse conduction delays were observed in dogs with a no-effect dose of 15 mg/kg (7-\n\nfold human exposure based on Cmax). \n\n \n\nAccumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages in the lung was observed in rats and mice. The no-\n\neffect dose in rats was 25 mg/kg (5-fold human exposure based on AUC) and in mice 750 mg/kg (142-\n\nfold human exposure). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal symptoms, particularly soft faeces, mucoid faeces, diarrhoea and, at higher doses, \n\nfaecal blood were observed in dogs. A no-effect level was not established. \n\n \n\nVildagliptin was not mutagenic in conventional in vitro and in vivo tests for genotoxicity. \n\n \n\nA fertility and early embryonic development study in rats revealed no evidence of impaired fertility, \n\nreproductive performance or early embryonic development due to vildagliptin. Embryo-foetal toxicity \n\nwas evaluated in rats and rabbits. An increased incidence of wavy ribs was observed in rats in \n\nassociation with reduced maternal body weight parameters, with a no-effect dose of 75 mg/kg (10-fold \n\nhuman exposure). In rabbits, decreased foetal weight and skeletal variations indicative of \n\ndevelopmental delays were noted only in the presence of severe maternal toxicity, with a no-effect \n\ndose of 50 mg/kg (9-fold human exposure). A pre- and postnatal development study was performed in \n\nrats. Findings were only observed in association with maternal toxicity at \u2265 150 mg/kg and included a \n\ntransient decrease in body weight and reduced motor activity in the F1 generation. \n\n \n\nA two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral doses up to 900 mg/kg (approximately \n\n200 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose). No increases in tumour incidence \n\nattributable to vildagliptin were observed. Another two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in \n\nmice at oral doses up to 1,000 mg/kg. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas and \n\nhaemangiosarcomas was observed with a no-effect dose of 500 mg/kg (59-fold human exposure) and \n\n100 mg/kg (16-fold human exposure), respectively. The increased incidence of these tumours in mice \n\nis considered not to represent a significant risk to humans based on the lack of genotoxicity of \n\nvildagliptin and its principal metabolite, the occurrence of tumours only in one species and the high \n\nsystemic exposure ratios at which tumours were observed. \n\n \n\nIn a 13-week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, skin lesions have been recorded at doses \n\n\u2265 5 mg/kg/day. These were consistently located on the extremities (hands, feet, ears and tail). At \n\n5 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to human AUC exposure at the 100 mg dose), only blisters \n\nwere observed. They were reversible despite continued treatment and were not associated with \n\nhistopathological abnormalities. Flaking skin, peeling skin, scabs and tail sores with correlating \n\nhistopathological changes were noted at doses \u2265 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times human AUC \n\nexposure at the 100 mg dose). Necrotic lesions of the tail were observed at \u2265 80 mg/kg/day. Skin \n\nlesions were not reversible in the monkeys treated at 160 mg/kg/day during a 4-week recovery period.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nJalra 50 mg tablets \n\nvildagliptin \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Jalra is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Jalra \n\n3. How to take Jalra \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Jalra \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Jalra is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThe active substance of Jalra, vildagliptin, belongs to a group of medicines called \u201coral antidiabetics\u201d. \n\n \n\nJalra is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. It is used when diabetes cannot be controlled \n\nby diet and exercise alone. It helps to control the level of sugar in the blood. Your doctor will \n\nprescribe Jalra either alone or together with certain other antidiabetic medicines which you will \n\nalready be taking, if these have not proved sufficiently effective to control diabetes. \n\n \n\nType 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body \n\nmakes does not work as well as it should. It can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. \n\n \n\nInsulin is a substance which helps to lower the level of sugar in the blood, especially after meals. \n\nGlucagon is a substance which triggers the production of sugar by the liver, causing the blood sugar \n\nlevel to rise. The pancreas makes both of these substances. \n\n \n\nHow Jalra works \n\nJalra works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. This helps to control the \n\nblood sugar level. This medicine has been shown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent \n\ncomplications from your diabetes. Even though you are now starting a medicine for your diabetes, it is \n\nimportant that you continue to follow the diet and/or exercise which has been recommended for you. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Jalra \n\n \n\nDo not take Jalra: \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to vildagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). If you think you may be allergic to vildagliptin or any of the other ingredients of \n\nJalra, do not take this medicine and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n32 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Jalra. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have type 1 diabetes (i.e. your body does not produce insulin) or if you have a condition \ncalled diabetic ketoacidosis. \n\n\uf0b7 if you are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as a sulphonylurea (your doctor may want to \nreduce your dose of the sulphonylurea when you take it together with Jalra in order to avoid low \n\nblood glucose [hypoglycaemia]). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have moderate or severe kidney disease (you will need to take a lower dose of Jalra). \n\n\uf0b7 if you are on dialysis. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have liver disease. \n\n\uf0b7 if you suffer from heart failure. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas. \n \n\nIf you have previously taken vildagliptin but had to stop taking it because of liver disease, you should \n\nnot take this medicine. \n\n \n\nDiabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the \n\nrecommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse. You are also \n\nadvised to pay particular attention to new onset of blisters or ulcers while taking Jalra. Should these \n\noccur, you should promptly consult your doctor. \n\n \n\nA test to determine your liver function will be performed before the start of Jalra treatment, at three-\n\nmonth intervals for the first year and periodically thereafter. This is so that signs of increased liver \n\nenzymes can be detected as early as possible. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe use of Jalra in children and adolescents up to 18 years of age is not recommended. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Jalra \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n \n\nYour doctor may wish to alter your dose of Jalra if you are taking other medicines such as: \n\n- thiazides or other diuretics (also called water tablets) \n\n- corticosteroids(generally used to treat inflammation) \n\n- thyroid medicines \n\n- certain medicines affecting the nervous system. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nYou should not use Jalra during pregnancy. It is not known if Jalra passes into breast milk. You should \n\nnot use Jalra if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIf you feel dizzy while taking Jalra, do not drive or use machines. \n\n \n\nJalra contains lactose \n\nJalra contains lactose (milk sugar).

antidiabetics\". jalra is used to treat adult patients with type 2 diabetes. it is used when diabetes cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone. it helps to control the level of sugar in the blood. your doctor will prescribe jalra either alone or together with certain other antidiabetic medicines which you will already be taking, if these have not proved sufficiently effective to control diabetes. type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that the body makes does not work as well as it should. it can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. insulin is a substance which helps to lower the level of sugar in the blood, especially after meals. glucagon is a substance which triggers the production of sugar by the liver, causing the blood sugar level to rise. the pancreas makes both of these substances. how jalra works jalra works by making the pancreas produce more insulin and less glucagon. this helps to control the blood sugar level. this medicine has been shown to reduce blood sugar, which may help to prevent complications from your diabetes. even though you are now starting a medicine for your diabetes, it is important that you continue to follow the diet and/or exercise which has been recommended for you.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "jalra", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 0,
