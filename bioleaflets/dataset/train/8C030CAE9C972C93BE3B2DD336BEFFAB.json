NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTESAVEL 25 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate, equivalent to 25 mg sitagliptin.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nRound, pink film-coated tablet with \u201c221\u201d on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFor adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, TESAVEL is indicated to improve glycaemic control:\n\nas monotherapy:\n\n\uf0b7 in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is \ninappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.\n\nas dual oral therapy in combination with:\n\n\uf0b7 metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic \ncontrol.\n\n\uf0b7 a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone \ndo not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to \ncontraindications or intolerance.\n\n\uf0b7 a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\uf067) agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) \nwhen use of a PPAR\uf067 agonist is appropriate and when diet and exercise plus the PPAR\uf067 agonist \nalone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\nas triple oral therapy in combination with:\n\n\uf0b7 a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal \nproducts do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\n\uf0b7 a PPAR\uf067 agonist and metformin when use of a PPAR\uf067 agonist is appropriate and when diet and \nexercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic \ncontrol.\n\nTESAVEL is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise \nplus stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe dose is 100 mg sitagliptin once daily. When used in combination with metformin and/or a PPAR\uf067\nagonist, the dose of metformin and/or PPAR\uf067 agonist should be maintained, and TESAVEL \nadministered concomitantly.\n\nWhen TESAVEL is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the \nsulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nIf a dose of TESAVEL is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose \nshould not be taken on the same day.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nWhen considering the use of sitagliptin in combination with another anti-diabetic medicinal product, \nits conditions for use in patients with renal impairment should be checked.\n\nFor patients with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] \uf0b3 60 to < 90 mL/min), no \ndose adjustment is required.\n\nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR \uf0b3 45 to < 60 mL/min), no dosage adjustment is \nrequired.\n\nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR \uf0b3 30 to < 45 mL/min), the dose of TESAVEL is \n50 mg once daily.\n\nFor patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \u2265 15 to <30 mL/min) or with end-stage renal disease \n(ESRD) (GFR < 15 mL/min), including those requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose \nof TESAVEL is 25 mg once daily. Treatment may be administered without regard to the timing of \ndialysis.\n\nBecause there is a dosage adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is \nrecommended prior to initiation of TESAVEL and periodically thereafter.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. TESAVEL\nhas not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and care should be exercised (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nHowever, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic impairment is not \nexpected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age.\n\nPaediatric population\nSitagliptin should not be used in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age because of insufficient \nefficacy. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. Sitagliptin has not been \nstudied in paediatric patients under 10 years of age.\n\nMethod of administration\nTESAVEL can be taken with or without food.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nTESAVEL should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients \nshould be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal \npain. Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed after discontinuation of sitagliptin (with or without \nsupportive treatment), but very rare cases of necrotising or haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death\nhave been reported. If pancreatitis is suspected, TESAVEL and other potentially suspect medicinal \nproducts should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, TESAVEL should not be \nrestarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n\nHypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products\nIn clinical trials of TESAVEL as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with medicinal \nproducts not known to cause hypoglycaemia (i.e. metformin and/or a PPAR\uf067 agonist), rates of \nhypoglycaemia reported with sitagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo. \nHypoglycaemia has been observed when sitagliptin was used in combination with insulin or a \nsulphonylurea. Therefore, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, a lower dose of sulphonylurea or \ninsulin may be considered (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nSitagliptin is renally excreted. To achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in \npatients with normal renal function, lower dosages are recommended in patients with GFR \n< 45 mL/min, as well as in ESRD patients requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nWhen considering the use of sitagliptin in combination with another anti-diabetic medicinal product, \nits conditions for use in patients with renal impairment should be checked.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nPost-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin have \nbeen reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions \nincluding Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after \ninitiation of treatment, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is \nsuspected, TESAVEL should be discontinued. Other potential causes for the event should be \nassessed, and alternative treatment for diabetes initiated.\n\nBullous pemphigoid\nThere have been post-marketing reports of bullous pemphigoid in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors \nincluding sitagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, TESAVEL should be discontinued.\n\nSodium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on sitagliptin\nClinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by \nco-administered medicinal products is low.\n\nIn vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin \nis CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. In patients with normal renal function, metabolism,\nincluding via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin. Metabolism may play a \nmore significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or \nend-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e. \nketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) could alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in \npatients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the setting \nof renal impairment has not been assessed in a clinical study.\n\nIn vitro transport studies showed that sitagliptin is a substrate for p-glycoprotein and organic anion \ntransporter-3 (OAT3). OAT3 mediated transport of sitagliptin was inhibited in vitro by probenecid, \nalthough the risk of clinically meaningful interactions is considered to be low. Concomitant \nadministration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo.\n\nMetformin: Co-administration of multiple twice-daily doses of 1,000 mg metformin with 50 mg \nsitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes.\n\nCiclosporin: A study was conducted to assess the effect of ciclosporin, a potent inhibitor of \np-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Co-administration of a single 100 mg oral dose \nof sitagliptin and a single 600 mg oral dose of ciclosporin increased the AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin \nby approximately 29 % and 68 %, respectively. These changes in sitagliptin pharmacokinetics were \nnot considered to be clinically meaningful. The renal clearance of sitagliptin was not meaningfully \naltered. Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p-glycoprotein\ninhibitors.\n\nEffects of sitagliptin on other medicinal products\nDigoxin: Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations. Following administration of \n0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of sitagliptin daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of \ndigoxin was increased on average by 11 %, and the plasma Cmax on average by 18 %. No dose \nadjustment of digoxin is recommended. However, patients at risk of digoxin toxicity should be \nmonitored for this when sitagliptin and digoxin are administered concomitantly.\n\nIn vitro data suggest that sitagliptin does not inhibit nor induce CYP450 isoenzymes. In clinical \nstudies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, \nsimvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low \npropensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic \ncationic transporter (OCT). Sitagliptin may be a mild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein in vivo.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of sitagliptin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nDue to lack of human data, TESAVEL should not be used during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether sitagliptin is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of sitagliptin in breast milk. TESAVEL should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nFertility\nAnimal data do not suggest an effect of treatment with sitagliptin on male and female fertility. Human \ndata are lacking.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTESAVEL has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when \ndriving or using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and somnolence have been \nreported.\n\nIn addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when TESAVEL is used in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nSerious adverse reactions including pancreatitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. \nHypoglycaemia has been reported in combination with sulphonylurea (4.7 %-13.8 %) and insulin \n(9.6 %) (see section 4.4). \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions are listed below (Table 1) by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).\n\nTable 1.

These included \nhypoglycaemia (frequency very common with the combination of sulphonylurea and metformin), \ninfluenza (common with insulin (with or without metformin)), nausea and vomiting (common with \nmetformin), flatulence (common with metformin or pioglitazone), constipation (common with the \ncombination of sulphonylurea and metformin), peripheral oedema (common with pioglitazone or the \ncombination of pioglitazone and metformin), somnolence and diarrhoea (uncommon with metformin), \nand dry mouth (uncommon with insulin (with or without metformin)).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn clinical trials with sitagliptin in paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 to17 years, \nthe profile of adverse reactions was comparable to that observed in adults.\n\nTECOS Cardiovascular Safety Study\nThe Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS) included 7,332 patients \ntreated with sitagliptin, 100 mg daily (or 50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was \u2265 30 and \n< 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 7,339 patients treated with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. \nBoth treatments were added to usual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. \n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nThe overall incidence of serious adverse events in patients receiving sitagliptin was similar to that in \npatients receiving placebo. \n\nIn the intention-to-treat population, among patients who were using insulin and/or a sulfonylurea at \nbaseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.7 % in sitagliptin-treated patients and 2.5 % in \nplacebo-treated patients; among patients who were not using insulin and/or a sulfonylurea at baseline, \nthe incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 1.0 % in sitagliptin-treated patients and 0.7 % in \nplacebo-treated patients. The incidence of adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis events was 0.3 % in \nsitagliptin-treated patients and 0.2 % in placebo-treated patients. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDuring controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were \nadministered. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in \none study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical \nstudies. In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions \nobserved with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg \nper day for periods of up to 28 days.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining \nan electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required.\n\nSitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5 % of the dose was removed \nover a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session. Prolonged haemodialysis may be considered if clinically \nappropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, \nATC code: A10BH01.\n\nMechanism of action\nTESAVEL is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 \n(DPP-4) inhibitors. The improvement in glycaemic control observed with this medicinal product may \nbe mediated by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including \nglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are \nreleased by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. The \nincretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose \nhomeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase \ninsulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving \ncyclic AMP. Treatment with GLP-1 or with DPP-4 inhibitors in animal models of type 2 diabetes has \nbeen demonstrated to improve beta cell responsiveness to glucose and stimulate insulin biosynthesis \nand release. With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake is enhanced. In addition, GLP-1 lowers \nglucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Decreased glucagon concentrations, along with higher \ninsulin levels, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, resulting in a decrease in blood glucose \nlevels. The effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent such that when blood glucose \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nconcentrations are low, stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon secretion by GLP-1 \nare not observed. For both GLP-1 and GIP, stimulation of insulin release is enhanced as glucose rises \nabove normal concentrations. Further, GLP-1 does not impair the normal glucagon response to \nhypoglycaemia. The activity of GLP-1 and GIP is limited by the DPP-4 enzyme, which rapidly \nhydrolyzes the incretin hormones to produce inactive products. Sitagliptin prevents the hydrolysis of \nincretin hormones by DPP-4, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the active forms of GLP-1 \nand GIP. By enhancing active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases \nglucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. In patients with type 2 diabetes with hyperglycaemia, \nthese changes in insulin and glucagon levels lead to lower haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lower fasting \nand postprandial glucose concentrations. The glucose-dependent mechanism of sitagliptin is distinct \nfrom the mechanism of sulphonylureas, which increase insulin secretion even when glucose levels are \nlow and can lead to hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and in normal subjects. Sitagliptin \nis a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 and does not inhibit the closely-related \nenzymes DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations.\n\nIn a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, \nwhereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. \nCo-administration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. \nSitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nOverall, sitagliptin improved glycaemic control when used as monotherapy or in combination \ntreatment in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (see Table 2).\n\nTwo studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin monotherapy. Treatment \nwith sitagliptin at 100 mg once daily as monotherapy provided significant improvements in HbA1c, \nfasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (2-hour PPG), compared to placebo in \ntwo studies, one of 18- and one of 24-weeks duration. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell \nfunction, including HOMA-\u03b2 (Homeostasis Model Assessment-\u03b2), proinsulin to insulin ratio, and \nmeasures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test were observed. \nThe observed incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with sitagliptin was similar to placebo. \nBody weight did not increase from baseline with sitagliptin therapy in either study, compared to a \nsmall reduction in patients given placebo.\n\nSitagliptin 100 mg once daily provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared \nwith placebo in two 24-week studies of sitagliptin as add-on therapy, one in combination with \nmetformin and one in combination with pioglitazone. Change from baseline in body weight was \nsimilar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to placebo. In these studies there was a similar \nincidence of hypoglycaemia reported for patients treated with sitagliptin or placebo.\n\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin\n(100 mg once daily) added to glimepiride alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin. The \naddition of sitagliptin to either glimepiride alone or to glimepiride and metformin provided significant \nimprovements in glycaemic parameters. Patients treated with sitagliptin had a modest increase in body \nweight compared to those given placebo.\n\nA 26-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin \n(100 mg once daily) added to the combination of pioglitazone and metformin. The addition of \nsitagliptin to pioglitazone and metformin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters. \nChange from baseline in body weight was similar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to \nplacebo. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was also similar in patients treated with sitagliptin or \nplacebo.\n\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin\n(100 mg once daily) added to insulin (at a stable dose for at least 10 weeks) with or without \nmetformin (at least 1,500 mg). In patients taking pre-mixed insulin, the mean daily dose was \n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\n70.9 U/day. In patients taking non-pre-mixed (intermediate/long-acting) insulin, the mean daily dose \nwas 44.3 U/day. The addition of sitagliptin to insulin provided significant improvements in glycaemic \nparameters. There was no meaningful change from baseline in body weight in either group.\n\nIn a 24-week placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy, sitagliptin 50 mg twice daily in \ncombination with metformin (500 mg or 1,000 mg twice daily) provided significant improvements in \nglycaemic parameters compared with either monotherapy. The decrease in body weight with the \ncombination of sitagliptin and metformin was similar to that observed with metformin alone or \nplacebo; there was no change from baseline for patients on sitagliptin alone. The incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.\n\nTable 2.

Treatment by stratum (metformin and insulin use) interactions were not \nsignificant (p > 0.10).\n\nA 24-week active (metformin)-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of \nsitagliptin 100 mg once daily (N=528) compared to metformin (N=522) in patients with inadequate \nglycaemic control on diet and exercise and who were not on anti-hyperglycaemic therapy (off therapy \nfor at least 4 months). The mean dose of metformin was approximately 1,900 mg per day. The \nreduction in HbA1c from mean baseline values of 7.2 % was -0.43 % for sitagliptin and -0.57 % for \nmetformin (Per Protocol Analysis). The overall incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions\nconsidered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin was 2.7 % compared with 12.6 % in \npatients treated with metformin. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was not significantly different \nbetween the treatment groups (sitagliptin, 1.3 %; metformin, 1.9 %). Body weight decreased from \nbaseline in both groups (sitagliptin, -0.6 kg; metformin -1.9 kg).\n\nIn a study comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or \nglipizide (a sulphonylurea) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, \nsitagliptin was similar to glipizide in reducing HbA1c. The mean glipizide dose used in the comparator \ngroup was 10 mg per day with approximately 40 % of patients requiring a glipizide dose of \n\uf0a3 5 mg/day throughout the study. However, more patients in the sitagliptin group discontinued due to \nlack of efficacy than in the glipizide group. Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant \nmean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients \nadministered glipizide (-1.5 vs. +1.1 kg). In this study, the proinsulin to insulin ratio, a marker of \nefficiency of insulin synthesis and release, improved with sitagliptin and deteriorated with glipizide \ntreatment. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9 %) was significantly lower \nthan that in the glipizide group (32.0 %).\n\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study involving 660 patients was designed to evaluate the \ninsulin-sparing efficacy and safety of sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) added to insulin glargine with or \nwithout metformin (at least 1,500 mg) during intensification of insulin therapy. Baseline HbA1c was \n8.74 % and baseline insulin dose was 37 IU/day. Patients were instructed to titrate their insulin \nglargine dose based on fingerstick fasting glucose values. At Week 24, the increase in daily insulin \ndose was 19 IU/day in patients treated with sitagliptin and 24 IU/day in patients treated with placebo. \nThe reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without metformin) \nwas -1.31 % compared to -0.87 % in patients treated with placebo and insulin (with or without \nmetformin), a difference of -0.45 % [95 % CI: -0.60, -0.29]. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was \n25.2 % in patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without metformin) and 36.8 % in \npatients treated with placebo and insulin (with or without metformin). The difference was mainly due \nto a higher percentage of patients in the placebo group experiencing 3 or more episodes of \nhypoglycaemia (9.4 vs. 19.1 %). There was no difference in the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia.\n\nA study comparing sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once daily to glipizide at 2.5 to 20 mg/day was \nconducted in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. This study involved 423 patients with\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nchronic renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min). After 54 weeks, the \nmean reduction from baseline in HbA1c was -0.76 % with sitagliptin and -0.64 % with glipizide (Per-\nProtocol Analysis). In this study, the efficacy and safety profile of sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once \ndaily was generally similar to that observed in other monotherapy studies in patients with normal \nrenal function. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (6.2 %) was significantly \nlower than that in the glipizide group (17.0 %). There was also a significant difference between \ngroups with respect to change from baseline body weight (sitagliptin -0.6 kg; glipizide +1.2 kg).\n\nAnother study comparing sitagliptin at 25 mg once daily to glipizide at 2.5 to 20 mg/day was \nconducted in 129 patients with ESRD who were on dialysis. After 54 weeks, the mean reduction from \nbaseline in HbA1c was -0.72 % with sitagliptin and -0.87 % with glipizide. In this study, the efficacy \nand safety profile of sitagliptin at 25 mg once daily was generally similar to that observed in other \nmonotherapy studies in patients with normal renal function. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was not \nsignificantly different between the treatment groups (sitagliptin, 6.3 %; glipizide, 10.8 %).\n\nIn another study involving 91 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 50 mL/min), the safety and tolerability of treatment with sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once \ndaily were generally similar to placebo. In addition, after 12 weeks, the mean reductions in HbA1c\n(sitagliptin -0.59 %; placebo -0.18 %) and FPG (sitagliptin -25.5 mg/dL; placebo -3.0 mg/dL) were \ngenerally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies in patients with normal renal \nfunction (see section 5.2).\n\nThe TECOS was a randomised study in 14,671 patients in the intention-to-treat population with an \nHbA1c of \u2265 6.5 to 8.0 % with established CV disease who received sitagliptin (7,332) 100 mg daily (or \n50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was \u2265 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2) or placebo (7,339) added to \nusual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. Patients with an eGFR \n< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were not to be enrolled in the study. The study population included \n2,004 patients \u2265 75 years of age and 3,324 patients with renal impairment \n(eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).\n\nOver the course of the study, the overall estimated mean (SD) difference in HbA1c between the \nsitagliptin and placebo groups was 0.29 % (0.01), 95 % CI (-0.32, -0.27); p < 0.001. \n\nThe primary cardiovascular endpoint was a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, \nnonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina. Secondary \ncardiovascular endpoints included the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial \ninfarction, or nonfatal stroke; first occurrence of the individual components of the primary composite; \nall-cause mortality; and hospital admissions for congestive heart failure.\n\nAfter a median follow up of 3 years, sitagliptin, when added to usual care, did not increase the risk of \nmajor adverse cardiovascular events or the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure compared to usual \ncare without sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (Table 3).\n\nTable 3.

For composite endpoints, the p-values correspond to a test of non-inferiority \nseeking to show that the hazard ratio is less than 1.3. For all other endpoints, the p-values correspond to a test of differences \nin hazard rates.\n\n\u2021 The analysis of hospitalisation for heart failure was adjusted for a history of heart failure at baseline.\n\nPaediatric population\nA 54-week, double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin \n100 mg once daily in paediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes who were not on \nanti-hyperglycaemic therapy for at least 12 weeks (with HbA1c 6.5% to 10%) or were on a stable \ndose of insulin for at least 12 weeks (with HbA1c 7% to 10%). Patients were randomised to sitagliptin \n100 mg once daily or placebo for 20 weeks.\n\nMean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%. Treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg did not provide significant \nimprovement in HbA1c at 20 weeks. The reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin \n(N=95) was 0.0% compared to 0.2% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.2%\n(95% CI: -0.7, 0.3). See section 4.2.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, \nwith peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose, mean plasma AUC \nof sitagliptin was 8.52 \uf06dM\u2022hr, Cmax was 950 nM. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is \napproximately 87 %. Since co-administration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics, TESAVEL may be administered with or without food.\n\nPlasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner. Dose-proportionality was not \nestablished for Cmax and C24hr (Cmax increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner and C24hr\nincreased in a less than dose-proportional manner).\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nDistribution\nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of \nsitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 litres. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound \nto plasma proteins is low (38 %).\n\nBiotransformation\nSitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway. \nApproximately 79 % of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine.\n\nFollowing a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16 % of the radioactivity was excreted as \nmetabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to \ncontribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the \nprimary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution \nfrom CYP2C8.\n\nIn vitro data showed that sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, \n1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.\n\nElimination\nFollowing administration of an oral [14C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100 % of \nthe administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (13 %) or urine (87 %) within one week of \ndosing. The apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately \n12.4 hours. Sitagliptin accumulates only minimally with multiple doses. The renal clearance was \napproximately 350 mL/min.\n\nElimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. \nSitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in \nthe renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not \nbeen established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in \nmediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, ciclosporin, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did \nnot reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin is not a substrate for OCT2 or OAT1 or \nPEPT1/2 transporters. In vitro, sitagliptin did not inhibit OAT3 (IC50=160 \uf06dM) or p-glycoprotein (up \nto 250 \uf06dM) mediated transport at therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations. In a clinical study \nsitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations indicating that sitagliptin may be a \nmild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein.\n\nCharacteristics in patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with \ntype 2 diabetes.\n\nRenal impairment\nA single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a reduced dose of \nsitagliptin (50 mg) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to normal \nhealthy control subjects. The study included patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal \nimpairment, as well as patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. In addition, the effects of renal \nimpairment on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate, or \nsevere renal impairment (including ESRD) were assessed using population pharmacokinetic analyses.\n\nCompared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased by \napproximately 1.2-fold and 1.6-fold in patients with mild renal impairment (GFR \u2265 60 to \n< 90 mL/min) and patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min), respectively. \nBecause increases of this magnitude are not clinically relevant, dosage adjustment in these patients is \nnot necessary.\n\nPlasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased approximately 2-fold in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment (GFR \u2265 30 to < 45 mL/min), and approximately 4-fold in patients with severe renal \n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nimpairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), including in patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. Sitagliptin was \nmodestly removed by haemodialysis (13.5 % over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session starting\n4 hours postdose). To achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in patients with \nnormal renal function, lower dosages are recommended in patients with GFR < 45 mL/min (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment for TESAVEL is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh score \uf0a3 9). There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh score > 9). However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, \nsevere hepatic impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the \npharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and \nPhase II data. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19 % higher plasma concentrations \nof sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin (single dose of 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg) were investigated in \npaediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. In this population, the dose-adjusted\nAUC of sitagliptin in plasma was approximately 18 % lower compared to adult patients with type 2 \ndiabetes for a 100 mg dose. This is not considered to be a clinically meaningful difference compared \nto adult patients based on the flat PK/PD relationship between the dose of 50 mg and 100 mg. No \nstudies with sitagliptin have been performed in paediatric patients with age <10 years.\n\nOther patient characteristics\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, race, or body mass index (BMI). These \ncharacteristics had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a \ncomposite analysis of Phase I pharmacokinetic data and on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of \nPhase I and Phase II data.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRenal and liver toxicity were observed in rodents at systemic exposure values 58 times the human \nexposure level, while the no-effect level was found at 19 times the human exposure level. Incisor teeth\nabnormalities were observed in rats at exposure levels 67 times the clinical exposure level; the \nno-effect level for this finding was 58-fold based on the 14-week rat study. The relevance of these \nfindings for humans is unknown. Transient treatment-related physical signs, some of which suggest \nneural toxicity, such as open-mouth breathing, salivation, white foamy emesis, ataxia, trembling, \ndecreased activity, and/or hunched posture were observed in dogs at exposure levels approximately \n23 times the clinical exposure level. In addition, very slight to slight skeletal muscle degeneration was \nalso observed histologically at doses resulting in systemic exposure levels of approximately 23 times \nthe human exposure level. A no-effect level for these findings was found at an exposure 6-fold the \nclinical exposure level.\n\nSitagliptin has not been demonstrated to be genotoxic in preclinical studies. Sitagliptin was not \ncarcinogenic in mice. In rats, there was an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas at \nsystemic exposure levels 58 times the human exposure level. Since hepatotoxicity has been shown to \ncorrelate with induction of hepatic neoplasia in rats, this increased incidence of hepatic tumours in \nrats was likely secondary to chronic hepatic toxicity at this high dose. Because of the high safety \nmargin (19-fold at this no-effect level), these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the \nsituation in humans.\n\nNo adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin prior to and \nthroughout mating.\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nIn a pre-/postnatal development study performed in rats sitagliptin showed no adverse effects.\n\nReproductive toxicity studies showed a slight treatment-related increased incidence of foetal rib \nmalformations (absent, hypoplastic and wavy ribs) in the offspring of rats at systemic exposure levels \nmore than 29 times the human exposure levels. Maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits at more than \n29 times the human exposure levels. Because of the high safety margins, these findings do not suggest\na relevant risk for human reproduction. Sitagliptin is secreted in considerable amounts into the milk of \nlactating rats (milk/plasma ratio: 4:1).\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFor adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, TESAVEL is indicated to improve glycaemic control:\n\nas monotherapy:\n\n\uf0b7 in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is \ninappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.\n\nas dual oral therapy in combination with:\n\n\uf0b7 metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic \ncontrol.\n\n\uf0b7 a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone\ndo not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to \ncontraindications or intolerance.\n\n\uf0b7 a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\uf067) agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) \nwhen use of a PPAR\uf067 agonist is appropriate and when diet and exercise plus the PPAR\uf067 agonist \nalone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\nas triple oral therapy in combination with:\n\n\uf0b7 a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal \nproducts do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\n\uf0b7 a PPAR\uf067 agonist and metformin when use of a PPAR\uf067 agonist is appropriate and when diet and \nexercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic \ncontrol.\n\nTESAVEL is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise \nplus stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe dose is 100 mg sitagliptin once daily. When used in combination with metformin and/or a PPAR\uf067\nagonist, the dose of metformin and/or PPAR\uf067 agonist should be maintained, and TESAVEL \nadministered concomitantly.\n\nWhen TESAVEL is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the \nsulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nIf a dose of TESAVEL is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose \nshould not be taken on the same day.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nWhen considering the use of sitagliptin in combination with another anti-diabetic medicinal product, \nits conditions for use in patients with renal impairment should be checked.\n\nFor patients with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] \uf0b3 60 to < 90 mL/min), no \ndose adjustment is required.\n\nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR \uf0b3 45 to < 60 mL/min), no dosage adjustment is \nrequired.\n\nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR \uf0b3 30 to < 45 mL/min), the dose of TESAVEL is\n50 mg once daily.\n\nFor patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \u2265 15 to <30 mL/min) or with end-stage renal disease \n(ESRD) (GFR < 15 mL/min), including those requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose \nof TESAVEL is 25 mg once daily. Treatment may be administered without regard to the timing of \ndialysis.\n\nBecause there is a dosage adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is \nrecommended prior to initiation of TESAVEL and periodically thereafter.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. TESAVEL\nhas not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and care should be exercised (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nHowever, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic impairment is not \nexpected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age.\n\nPaediatric population\nSitagliptin should not be used in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age because of insufficient \nefficacy. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. Sitagliptin has not been \nstudied in paediatric patients under 10 years of age.\n\nMethod of administration\nTESAVEL can be taken with or without food.\n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nTESAVEL should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients \nshould be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal \npain. Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed after discontinuation of sitagliptin (with or without \nsupportive treatment), but very rare cases of necrotising or haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death \nhave been reported. If pancreatitis is suspected, TESAVEL and other potentially suspect medicinal \nproducts should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, TESAVEL should not be \nrestarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n\nHypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products\nIn clinical trials of TESAVEL as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with medicinal \nproducts not known to cause hypoglycaemia (i.e. metformin and/or a PPAR\uf067 agonist), rates of \nhypoglycaemia reported with sitagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo. \nHypoglycaemia has been observed when sitagliptin was used in combination with insulin or a \nsulphonylurea. Therefore, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, a lower dose of sulphonylurea or \ninsulin may be considered (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nSitagliptin is renally excreted. To achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in \npatients with normal renal function, lower dosages are recommended in patients with GFR \n< 45 mL/min, as well as in ESRD patients requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nWhen considering the use of sitagliptin in combination with another anti-diabetic medicinal product, \nits conditions for use in patients with renal impairment should be checked.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nPost-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin have \nbeen reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions \nincluding Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after \ninitiation of treatment, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is \nsuspected, TESAVEL should be discontinued. Other potential causes for the event should be \nassessed, and alternative treatment for diabetes initiated.\n\nBullous pemphigoid\nThere have been post-marketing reports of bullous pemphigoid in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors \nincluding sitagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, TESAVEL should be discontinued.\n\nSodium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on sitagliptin\nClinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by co-\nadministered medicinal products is low.\n\nIn vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin \nis CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, \nincluding via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin. Metabolism may play a \nmore significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or \nend-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e. \nketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) could alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in \npatients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the setting \nof renal impairment has not been assessed in a clinical study.\n\nIn vitro transport studies showed that sitagliptin is a substrate for p-glycoprotein and organic anion \ntransporter-3 (OAT3). OAT3 mediated transport of sitagliptin was inhibited in vitro by probenecid, \nalthough the risk of clinically meaningful interactions is considered to be low. Concomitant \nadministration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo.\n\nMetformin: Co-administration of multiple twice-daily doses of 1,000 mg metformin with 50 mg \nsitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes.\n\nCiclosporin: A study was conducted to assess the effect of ciclosporin, a potent inhibitor of \np-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Co-administration of a single 100 mg oral dose \nof sitagliptin and a single 600 mg oral dose of ciclosporin increased the AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin\nby approximately 29 % and 68 %, respectively. These changes in sitagliptin pharmacokinetics were \nnot considered to be clinically meaningful. The renal clearance of sitagliptin was not meaningfully \naltered. Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p-glycoprotein\ninhibitors.\n\nEffects of sitagliptin on other medicinal products\nDigoxin: Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations. Following administration of \n0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of sitagliptin daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of \ndigoxin was increased on average by 11 %, and the plasma Cmax on average by 18 %. No dose \nadjustment of digoxin is recommended. However, patients at risk of digoxin toxicity should be \nmonitored for this when sitagliptin and digoxin are administered concomitantly.\n\nIn vitro data suggest that sitagliptin does not inhibit nor induce CYP450 isoenzymes. In clinical \nstudies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, \nsimvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low \npropensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic \ncationic transporter (OCT). Sitagliptin may be a mild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein in vivo.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of sitagliptin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nDue to lack of human data, TESAVEL should not be used during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether sitagliptin is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of sitagliptin in breast milk. TESAVEL should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nFertility\nAnimal data do not suggest an effect of treatment with sitagliptin on male and female fertility. Human \ndata are lacking.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTESAVEL has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when \ndriving or using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and somnolence have been \nreported.\n\nIn addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when TESAVEL is used in \ncombination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nSerious adverse reactions including pancreatitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. \nHypoglycaemia has been reported in combination with sulphonylurea (4.7 %-13.8 %) and insulin \n(9.6 %) (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions are listed below (Table 1) by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).\n\nTable 1.

These included \nhypoglycaemia (frequency very common with the combination of sulphonylurea and metformin), \ninfluenza (common with insulin (with or without metformin)), nausea and vomiting (common with \nmetformin), flatulence (common with metformin or pioglitazone), constipation (common with the \ncombination of sulphonylurea and metformin), peripheral oedema (common with pioglitazone or the \ncombination of pioglitazone and metformin), somnolence and diarrhoea (uncommon with metformin), \nand dry mouth (uncommon with insulin (with or without metformin)).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn clinical trials with sitagliptin in paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 to17 years, \nthe profile of adverse reactions was comparable to that observed in adults.\n\nTECOS Cardiovascular Safety Study\nThe Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS) included 7,332 patients \ntreated with sitagliptin, 100 mg daily (or 50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was \u2265 30 and \n< 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 7,339 patients treated with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. \nBoth treatments were added to usual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. \n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nThe overall incidence of serious adverse events in patients receiving sitagliptin was similar to that in \npatients receiving placebo. \n\nIn the intention-to-treat population, among patients who were using insulin and/or a sulfonylurea at \nbaseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.7 % in sitagliptin-treated patients and 2.5 % in \nplacebo-treated patients; among patients who were not using insulin and/or a sulfonylurea at baseline, \nthe incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 1.0 % in sitagliptin-treated patients and 0.7 % in \nplacebo-treated patients. The incidence of adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis events was 0.3 % in \nsitagliptin-treated patients and 0.2 % in placebo-treated patients. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDuring controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were \nadministered. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in \none study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical \nstudies. In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions \nobserved with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg \nper day for periods of up to 28 days.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining \nan electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required.\n\nSitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5 % of the dose was removed \nover a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session. Prolonged haemodialysis may be considered if clinically \nappropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, \nATC code: A10BH01.\n\nMechanism of action\nTESAVEL is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 \n(DPP-4) inhibitors. The improvement in glycaemic control observed with this medicinal product may \nbe mediated by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including \nglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are \nreleased by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. The \nincretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose \nhomeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase \ninsulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving \ncyclic AMP. Treatment with GLP-1 or with DPP-4 inhibitors in animal models of type 2 diabetes has \nbeen demonstrated to improve beta cell responsiveness to glucose and stimulate insulin biosynthesis \nand release. With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake is enhanced. In addition, GLP-1 lowers \nglucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Decreased glucagon concentrations, along with higher \ninsulin levels, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, resulting in a decrease in blood glucose \nlevels. The effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent such that when blood glucose \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25\n\nconcentrations are low, stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon secretion by GLP-1 \nare not observed. For both GLP-1 and GIP, stimulation of insulin release is enhanced as glucose rises \nabove normal concentrations. Further, GLP-1 does not impair the normal glucagon response to \nhypoglycaemia. The activity of GLP-1 and GIP is limited by the DPP-4 enzyme, which rapidly \nhydrolyzes the incretin hormones to produce inactive products. Sitagliptin prevents the hydrolysis of \nincretin hormones by DPP-4, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the active forms of GLP-1 \nand GIP. By enhancing active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases \nglucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. In patients with type 2 diabetes with hyperglycaemia, \nthese changes in insulin and glucagon levels lead to lower haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lower fasting \nand postprandial glucose concentrations. The glucose-dependent mechanism of sitagliptin is distinct \nfrom the mechanism of sulphonylureas, which increase insulin secretion even when glucose levels are \nlow and can lead to hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and in normal subjects. Sitagliptin \nis a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 and does not inhibit the closely-related \nenzymes DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations.\n\nIn a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, \nwhereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents.\nCo-administration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. \nSitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nOverall, sitagliptin improved glycaemic control when used as monotherapy or in combination \ntreatment in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (see Table 2).\n\nTwo studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin monotherapy. Treatment \nwith sitagliptin at 100 mg once daily as monotherapy provided significant improvements in HbA1c, \nfasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (2-hour PPG), compared to placebo in \ntwo studies, one of 18- and one of 24-weeks duration. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell \nfunction, including HOMA-\u03b2 (Homeostasis Model Assessment-\u03b2), proinsulin to insulin ratio, and \nmeasures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test were observed. \nThe observed incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with sitagliptin was similar to placebo. \nBody weight did not increase from baseline with sitagliptin therapy in either study, compared to a \nsmall reduction in patients given placebo.\n\nSitagliptin 100 mg once daily provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared \nwith placebo in two 24-week studies of sitagliptin as add-on therapy, one in combination with \nmetformin and one in combination with pioglitazone. Change from baseline in body weight was \nsimilar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to placebo. In these studies there was a similar \nincidence of hypoglycaemia reported for patients treated with sitagliptin or placebo.\n\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin\n(100 mg once daily) added to glimepiride alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin. The \naddition of sitagliptin to either glimepiride alone or to glimepiride and metformin provided significant \nimprovements in glycaemic parameters. Patients treated with sitagliptin had a modest increase in body \nweight compared to those given placebo.\n\nA 26-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin \n(100 mg once daily) added to the combination of pioglitazone and metformin. The addition of \nsitagliptin to pioglitazone and metformin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters. \nChange from baseline in body weight was similar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to \nplacebo. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was also similar in patients treated with sitagliptin or \nplacebo.\n\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin\n(100 mg once daily) added to insulin (at a stable dose for at least 10 weeks) with or without \nmetformin (at least 1,500 mg). In patients taking pre-mixed insulin, the mean daily dose was \n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\n70.9 U/day. In patients taking non-pre-mixed (intermediate/long-acting) insulin, the mean daily dose \nwas 44.3 U/day. The addition of sitagliptin to insulin provided significant improvements in glycaemic \nparameters. There was no meaningful change from baseline in body weight in either group.\n\nIn a 24-week placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy, sitagliptin 50 mg twice daily in \ncombination with metformin (500 mg or 1,000 mg twice daily) provided significant improvements in \nglycaemic parameters compared with either monotherapy. The decrease in body weight with the \ncombination of sitagliptin and metformin was similar to that observed with metformin alone or \nplacebo; there was no change from baseline for patients on sitagliptin alone. The incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.\n\nTable 2.

Treatment by stratum (metformin and insulin use) interactions were not \nsignificant (p > 0.10).\n\nA 24-week active (metformin)-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of \nsitagliptin 100 mg once daily (N=528) compared to metformin (N=522) in patients with inadequate \nglycaemic control on diet and exercise and who were not on anti-hyperglycaemic therapy (off therapy \nfor at least 4 months). The mean dose of metformin was approximately 1,900 mg per day. The \nreduction in HbA1c from mean baseline values of 7.2 % was -0.43 % for sitagliptin and -0.57 % for \nmetformin (Per Protocol Analysis). The overall incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions\nconsidered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin was 2.7 % compared with 12.6 % in \npatients treated with metformin. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was not significantly different \nbetween the treatment groups (sitagliptin, 1.3 %; metformin, 1.9 %). Body weight decreased from \nbaseline in both groups (sitagliptin, -0.6 kg; metformin -1.9 kg).\n\nIn a study comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or \nglipizide (a sulphonylurea) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, \nsitagliptin was similar to glipizide in reducing HbA1c. The mean glipizide dose used in the comparator \ngroup was 10 mg per day with approximately 40 % of patients requiring a glipizide dose of \n\uf0a3 5 mg/day throughout the study. However, more patients in the sitagliptin group discontinued due to \nlack of efficacy than in the glipizide group. Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant \nmean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients \nadministered glipizide (-1.5 vs. +1.1 kg). In this study, the proinsulin to insulin ratio, a marker of \nefficiency of insulin synthesis and release, improved with sitagliptin and deteriorated with glipizide \ntreatment. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9 %) was significantly lower \nthan that in the glipizide group (32.0 %).\n\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study involving 660 patients was designed to evaluate the \ninsulin-sparing efficacy and safety of sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) added to insulin glargine with or \nwithout metformin (at least 1,500 mg) during intensification of insulin therapy. Baseline HbA1c was \n8.74 % and baseline insulin dose was 37 IU/day. Patients were instructed to titrate their insulin \nglargine dose based on fingerstick fasting glucose values. At Week 24, the increase in daily insulin \ndose was 19 IU/day in patients treated with sitagliptin and 24 IU/day in patients treated with placebo. \nThe reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without metformin) \nwas -1.31 % compared to -0.87 % in patients treated with placebo and insulin (with or without \nmetformin), a difference of -0.45 % [95 % CI: -0.60, -0.29]. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was \n25.2 % in patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without metformin) and 36.8 % in \npatients treated with placebo and insulin (with or without metformin). The difference was mainly due \nto a higher percentage of patients in the placebo group experiencing 3 or more episodes of \nhypoglycaemia (9.4 vs. 19.1 %). There was no difference in the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia.\n\nA study comparing sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once daily to glipizide at 2.5 to 20 mg/day was \nconducted in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. This study involved 423 patients with\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nchronic renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min). After 54 weeks, the \nmean reduction from baseline in HbA1c was -0.76 % with sitagliptin and -0.64 % with glipizide\n(Per-Protocol Analysis). In this study, the efficacy and safety profile of sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once \ndaily was generally similar to that observed in other monotherapy studies in patients with normal \nrenal function. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (6.2 %) was significantly \nlower than that in the glipizide group (17.0 %). There was also a significant difference between \ngroups with respect to change from baseline body weight (sitagliptin -0.6 kg; glipizide +1.2 kg).\n\nAnother study comparing sitagliptin at 25 mg once daily to glipizide at 2.5 to 20 mg/day was \nconducted in 129 patients with ESRD who were on dialysis. After 54 weeks, the mean reduction from \nbaseline in HbA1c was -0.72 % with sitagliptin and -0.87 % with glipizide. In this study, the efficacy \nand safety profile of sitagliptin at 25 mg once daily was generally similar to that observed in other \nmonotherapy studies in patients with normal renal function. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was not \nsignificantly different between the treatment groups (sitagliptin, 6.3 %; glipizide, 10.8 %).\n\nIn another study involving 91 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 50 mL/min), the safety and tolerability of treatment with sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once \ndaily were generally similar to placebo. In addition, after 12 weeks, the mean reductions in HbA1c\n(sitagliptin -0.59 %; placebo -0.18 %) and FPG (sitagliptin -25.5 mg/dL; placebo -3.0 mg/dL) were \ngenerally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies in patients with normal renal \nfunction (see section 5.2).\n\nThe TECOS was a randomised study in 14,671 patients in the intention-to-treat population with an \nHbA1c of \u2265 6.5 to 8.0 % with established CV disease who received sitagliptin (7,332) 100 mg daily (or \n50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was \u2265 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2) or placebo (7,339) added to \nusual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. Patients with an eGFR \n< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were not to be enrolled in the study. The study population included \n2,004 patients \u2265 75 years of age and 3,324 patients with renal impairment \n(eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).\n\nOver the course of the study, the overall estimated mean (SD) difference in HbA1c between the \nsitagliptin and placebo groups was 0.29 % (0.01), 95 % CI (-0.32, -0.27); p < 0.001. \n\nThe primary cardiovascular endpoint was a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, \nnonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina. Secondary \ncardiovascular endpoints included the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial \ninfarction, or nonfatal stroke; first occurrence of the individual components of the primary composite; \nall-cause mortality; and hospital admissions for congestive heart failure.\n\nAfter a median follow up of 3 years, sitagliptin, when added to usual care, did not increase the risk of \nmajor adverse cardiovascular events or the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure compared to usual \ncare without sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (Table 3).\n\nTable 3.

For all other endpoints, the p-values correspond to a test of differences \nin hazard rates.\n\n\u2021 The analysis of hospitalisation for heart failure was adjusted for a history of heart failure at baseline.\n\nPaediatric population\nA 54-week, double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin \n100 mg once daily in paediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes who were not on \nanti-hyperglycaemic therapy for at least 12 weeks (with HbA1c 6.5% to 10%) or were on a stable \ndose of insulin for at least 12 weeks (with HbA1c 7% to 10%). Patients were randomised to sitagliptin \n100 mg once daily or placebo for 20 weeks.\n\nMean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%. Treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg did not provide significant \nimprovement in HbA1c at 20 weeks. The reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin \n(N=95) was 0.0% compared to 0.2% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.2%\n(95% CI: -0.7, 0.3). See section 4.2.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, \nwith peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose, mean plasma AUC\nof sitagliptin was 8.52 \uf06dM\u2022hr, Cmax was 950 nM. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is \napproximately 87 %. Since co-administration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics, TESAVEL may be administered with or without food.\n\nPlasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner. Dose-proportionality was not \nestablished for Cmax and C24hr (Cmax increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner and C24hr\nincreased in a less than dose-proportional manner).\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nDistribution\nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of \nsitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 litres. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound \nto plasma proteins is low (38 %).\n\nBiotransformation\nSitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway. \nApproximately 79 % of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine.\n\nFollowing a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16 % of the radioactivity was excreted as \nmetabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to \ncontribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the \nprimary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution \nfrom CYP2C8.\n\nIn vitro data showed that sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, \n1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.\n\nElimination\nFollowing administration of an oral [14C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100 % of \nthe administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (13 %) or urine (87 %) within one week of \ndosing. The apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately \n12.4 hours. Sitagliptin accumulates only minimally with multiple doses. The renal clearance was \napproximately 350 mL/min.\n\nElimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. \nSitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in \nthe renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not \nbeen established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in \nmediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, ciclosporin, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did \nnot reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin is not a substrate for OCT2 or OAT1 or \nPEPT1/2 transporters. In vitro, sitagliptin did not inhibit OAT3 (IC50=160 \uf06dM) or p-glycoprotein (up \nto 250 \uf06dM) mediated transport at therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations. In a clinical study \nsitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations indicating that sitagliptin may be a \nmild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein.\n\nCharacteristics in patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with \ntype 2 diabetes.\n\nRenal impairment\nA single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a reduced dose of \nsitagliptin (50 mg) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to normal \nhealthy control subjects. The study included patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal \nimpairment, as well as patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. In addition, the effects of renal \nimpairment on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate, or \nsevere renal impairment (including ESRD) were assessed using population pharmacokinetic analyses.\n\nCompared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased by \napproximately 1.2-fold and 1.6-fold in patients with mild renal impairment (GFR \u2265 60 to \n< 90 mL/min) and patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min), respectively. \nBecause increases of this magnitude are not clinically relevant, dosage adjustment in these patients is \nnot necessary.\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\nPlasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased approximately 2-fold in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment (GFR \u2265 30 to < 45 mL/min), and approximately 4-fold in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), including in patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. Sitagliptin was \nmodestly removed by haemodialysis (13.5 % over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session starting\n4 hours postdose). To achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in patients with \nnormal renal function, lower dosages are recommended in patients with GFR < 45 mL/min (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment for TESAVEL is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh score \uf0a3 9). There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh score > 9). However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, \nsevere hepatic impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the \npharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and \nPhase II data. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19 % higher plasma concentrations \nof sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin (single dose of 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg) were investigated in \npaediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. In this population, the dose-adjusted\nAUC of sitagliptin in plasma was approximately 18 % lower compared to adult patients with type 2 \ndiabetes for a 100 mg dose. This is not considered to be a clinically meaningful difference compared \nto adult patients based on the flat PK/PD relationship between the dose of 50 mg and 100 mg. No \nstudies with sitagliptin have been performed in paediatric patients with age <10 years.\n\nOther patient characteristics\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, race, or body mass index (BMI). These \ncharacteristics had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a \ncomposite analysis of Phase I pharmacokinetic data and on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of \nPhase I and Phase II data.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRenal and liver toxicity were observed in rodents at systemic exposure values 58 times the human \nexposure level, while the no-effect level was found at 19 times the human exposure level. Incisor teeth\nabnormalities were observed in rats at exposure levels 67 times the clinical exposure level; the \nno-effect level for this finding was 58-fold based on the 14-week rat study. The relevance of these \nfindings for humans is unknown. Transient treatment-related physical signs, some of which suggest \nneural toxicity, such as open-mouth breathing, salivation, white foamy emesis, ataxia, trembling, \ndecreased activity, and/or hunched posture were observed in dogs at exposure levels approximately \n23 times the clinical exposure level. In addition, very slight to slight skeletal muscle degeneration was \nalso observed histologically at doses resulting in systemic exposure levels of approximately 23 times \nthe human exposure level. A no-effect level for these findings was found at an exposure 6-fold the \nclinical exposure level.\n\nSitagliptin has not been demonstrated to be genotoxic in preclinical studies. Sitagliptin was not \ncarcinogenic in mice. In rats, there was an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas at \nsystemic exposure levels 58 times the human exposure level. Since hepatotoxicity has been shown to \ncorrelate with induction of hepatic neoplasia in rats, this increased incidence of hepatic tumours in \nrats was likely secondary to chronic hepatic toxicity at this high dose. Because of the high safety \nmargin (19-fold at this no-effect level), these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the \nsituation in humans.\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\nNo adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin prior to and \nthroughout mating.\n\nIn a pre-/postnatal development study performed in rats sitagliptin showed no adverse effects.\n\nReproductive toxicity studies showed a slight treatment-related increased incidence of foetal rib \nmalformations (absent, hypoplastic and wavy ribs) in the offspring of rats at systemic exposure levels \nmore than 29 times the human exposure levels. Maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits at more than \n29 times the human exposure levels. Because of the high safety margins, these findings do not suggest \na relevant risk for human reproduction. Sitagliptin is secreted in considerable amounts into the milk of \nlactating rats (milk/plasma ratio: 4:1).\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFor adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, TESAVEL is indicated to improve glycaemic control:\n\nas monotherapy:\n\n\uf0b7 in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is \ninappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.\n\nas dual oral therapy in combination with:\n\n\uf0b7 metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic \ncontrol.\n\n\uf0b7 a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone\ndo not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to \ncontraindications or intolerance.\n\n\uf0b7 a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\uf067) agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) \nwhen use of a PPAR\uf067 agonist is appropriate and when diet and exercise plus the PPAR\uf067 agonist \nalone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\nas triple oral therapy in combination with:\n\n\uf0b7 a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal \nproducts do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\n\uf0b7 a PPAR\uf067 agonist and metformin when use of a PPAR\uf067 agonist is appropriate and when diet and \nexercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic \ncontrol.\n\nTESAVEL is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise \nplus stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe dose is 100 mg sitagliptin once daily. When used in combination with metformin and/or a PPAR\uf067\nagonist, the dose of metformin and/or PPAR\uf067 agonist should be maintained, and TESAVEL \nadministered concomitantly.\n\nWhen TESAVEL is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the \nsulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\nIf a dose of TESAVEL is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose \nshould not be taken on the same day.\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nWhen considering the use of sitagliptin in combination with another anti-diabetic medicinal product, \nits conditions for use in patients with renal impairment should be checked.\n\nFor patients with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] \uf0b3 60 to < 90 ml/min), no \ndose adjustment is required.\n\nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR \uf0b3 45 to < 60 mL/min), no dosage adjustment is \nrequired.\n\nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR \uf0b3 30 to < 45 mL/min), the dose of TESAVEL is\n50 mg once daily.\n\nFor patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \u2265 15 to <30 mL/min) or with end-stage renal disease \n(ESRD) (GFR < 15 mL/min), including those requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose \nof TESAVEL is 25 mg once daily. Treatment may be administered without regard to the timing of \ndialysis.\n\nBecause there is a dosage adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is \nrecommended prior to initiation of TESAVEL and periodically thereafter.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. TESAVEL\nhas not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and care should be exercised (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nHowever, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic impairment is not \nexpected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age. \n\nPaediatric population\nSitagliptin should not be used in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age because of insufficient \nefficacy. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. Sitagliptin has not been \nstudied in paediatric patients under 10 years of age.\n\nMethod of administration\nTESAVEL can be taken with or without food.\n\n \n\n\n\n36\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nTESAVEL should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients \nshould be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal \npain. Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed after discontinuation of sitagliptin (with or without \nsupportive treatment), but very rare cases of necrotising or haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death \nhave been reported. If pancreatitis is suspected, TESAVEL and other potentially suspect medicinal \nproducts should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, TESAVEL should not be \nrestarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n\nHypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products\nIn clinical trials of TESAVEL as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with medicinal \nproducts not known to cause hypoglycaemia (i.e. metformin and/or a PPAR\uf067 agonist), rates of \nhypoglycaemia reported with sitagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo. \nHypoglycaemia has been observed when sitagliptin was used in combination with insulin or a\nsulphonylurea. Therefore, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, a lower dose of sulphonylurea or \ninsulin may be considered (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nSitagliptin is renally excreted. To achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in \npatients with normal renal function, lower dosages are recommended in patients with GFR \n< 45 mL/min, as well as in ESRD patients requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nWhen considering the use of sitagliptin in combination with another anti-diabetic medicinal product, \nits conditions for use in patients with renal impairment should be checked.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nPost-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin have \nbeen reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions \nincluding Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after \ninitiation of treatment, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is \nsuspected, TESAVEL should be discontinued. Other potential causes for the event should be \nassessed, and alternative treatment for diabetes initiated.\n\nBullous pemphigoid\nThere have been post-marketing reports of bullous pemphigoid in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors \nincluding sitagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, TESAVEL should be discontinued.\n\nSodium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n \n\n\n\n37\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on sitagliptin\nClinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by \nco-administered medicinal products is low.\n\nIn vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin \nis CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, \nincluding via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin. Metabolism may play a \nmore significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or \nend-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e. \nketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) could alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in \npatients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the setting \nof renal impairment has not been assessed in a clinical study.\n\nIn vitro transport studies showed that sitagliptin is a substrate for p-glycoprotein and organic anion \ntransporter-3 (OAT3). OAT3 mediated transport of sitagliptin was inhibited in vitro by probenecid, \nalthough the risk of clinically meaningful interactions is considered to be low. Concomitant \nadministration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo.\n\nMetformin: Co-administration of multiple twice-daily doses of 1,000 mg metformin with 50 mg \nsitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes.\n\nCiclosporin: A study was conducted to assess the effect of ciclosporin, a potent inhibitor of \np-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Co-administration of a single 100 mg oral dose \nof sitagliptin and a single 600 mg oral dose of ciclosporin increased the AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin \nby approximately 29 % and 68 %, respectively. These changes in sitagliptin pharmacokinetics were \nnot considered to be clinically meaningful. The renal clearance of sitagliptin was not meaningfully \naltered. Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p-glycoprotein\ninhibitors.\n\nEffects of sitagliptin on other medicinal products\nDigoxin: Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations. Following administration of \n0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of sitagliptin daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of \ndigoxin was increased on average by 11 %, and the plasma Cmax on average by 18 %. No dose \nadjustment of digoxin is recommended. However, patients at risk of digoxin toxicity should be \nmonitored for this when sitagliptin and digoxin are administered concomitantly.\n\nIn vitro data suggest that sitagliptin does not inhibit nor induce CYP450 isoenzymes. In clinical \nstudies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, \nsimvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low \npropensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic \ncationic transporter (OCT). Sitagliptin may be a mild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein in vivo.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of sitagliptin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nDue to lack of human data, TESAVEL should not be used during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether sitagliptin is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of sitagliptin in breast milk. TESAVEL should not be used during breast-feeding.\n\n \n\n\n\n38\n\nFertility\nAnimal data do not suggest an effect of treatment with sitagliptin on male and female fertility. Human \ndata are lacking.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTESAVEL has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when \ndriving or using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and somnolence have been \nreported.\n\nIn addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when TESAVEL is used in\ncombination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nSerious adverse reactions including pancreatitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. \nHypoglycaemia has been reported in combination with sulphonylurea (4.7 %-13.8 %) and insulin \n(9.6 %) (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions are listed below (Table 1) by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).\n\nTable 1.

These included \nhypoglycaemia (frequency very common with the combination of sulphonylurea and metformin), \ninfluenza (common with insulin (with or without metformin)), nausea and vomiting (common with \nmetformin), flatulence (common with metformin or pioglitazone), constipation (common with the \ncombination of sulphonylurea and metformin), peripheral oedema (common with pioglitazone or the \ncombination of pioglitazone and metformin), somnolence and diarrhoea (uncommon with metformin), \nand dry mouth (uncommon with insulin (with or without metformin)).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn clinical trials with sitagliptin in paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 to17 years, \nthe profile of adverse reactions was comparable to that observed in adults.\n\nTECOS Cardiovascular Safety Study\nThe Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS) included 7,332 patients \ntreated with sitagliptin, 100 mg daily (or 50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was \u2265 30 and \n< 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 7,339 patients treated with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. \nBoth treatments were added to usual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. \n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nThe overall incidence of serious adverse events in patients receiving sitagliptin was similar to that in \npatients receiving placebo. \n\nIn the intention-to-treat population, among patients who were using insulin and/or a sulfonylurea at \nbaseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.7 % in sitagliptin-treated patients and 2.5 % in \nplacebo-treated patients; among patients who were not using insulin and/or a sulfonylurea at baseline, \nthe incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 1.0 % in sitagliptin-treated patients and 0.7 % in \nplacebo-treated patients. The incidence of adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis events was 0.3 % in \nsitagliptin-treated patients and 0.2 % in placebo-treated patients. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDuring controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were \nadministered. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in \none study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical \nstudies. In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions \nobserved with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg \nper day for periods of up to 28 days.\n\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining \nan electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required.\n\nSitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5 % of the dose was removed \nover a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session. Prolonged haemodialysis may be considered if clinically \nappropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, \nATC code: A10BH01.\n\nMechanism of action\nTESAVEL is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 \n(DPP-4) inhibitors. The improvement in glycaemic control observed with this medicinal product may \nbe mediated by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including \nglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are \nreleased by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. The \nincretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose \nhomeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase \ninsulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving \ncyclic AMP. Treatment with GLP-1 or with DPP-4 inhibitors in animal models of type 2 diabetes has \nbeen demonstrated to improve beta cell responsiveness to glucose and stimulate insulin biosynthesis \nand release. With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake is enhanced. In addition, GLP-1 lowers \nglucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Decreased glucagon concentrations, along with higher \ninsulin levels, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, resulting in a decrease in blood glucose \nlevels. The effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent such that when blood glucose \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n41\n\nconcentrations are low, stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon secretion by GLP-1 \nare not observed. For both GLP-1 and GIP, stimulation of insulin release is enhanced as glucose rises \nabove normal concentrations. Further, GLP-1 does not impair the normal glucagon response to \nhypoglycaemia. The activity of GLP-1 and GIP is limited by the DPP-4 enzyme, which rapidly \nhydrolyzes the incretin hormones to produce inactive products. Sitagliptin prevents the hydrolysis of \nincretin hormones by DPP-4, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the active forms of GLP-1 \nand GIP. By enhancing active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases \nglucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. In patients with type 2 diabetes with hyperglycaemia, \nthese changes in insulin and glucagon levels lead to lower haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lower fasting \nand postprandial glucose concentrations. The glucose-dependent mechanism of sitagliptin is distinct \nfrom the mechanism of sulphonylureas, which increase insulin secretion even when glucose levels are \nlow and can lead to hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and in normal subjects. Sitagliptin \nis a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 and does not inhibit the closely-related \nenzymes DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations.\n\nIn a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, \nwhereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. \nCo-administration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. \nSitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nOverall, sitagliptin improved glycaemic control when used as monotherapy or in combination \ntreatment in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (see Table 2).\n\nTwo studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin monotherapy. Treatment \nwith sitagliptin at 100 mg once daily as monotherapy provided significant improvements in HbA1c, \nfasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (2-hour PPG), compared to placebo in \ntwo studies, one of 18- and one of 24-weeks duration. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell \nfunction, including HOMA-\u03b2 (Homeostasis Model Assessment-\u03b2), proinsulin to insulin ratio, and \nmeasures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test were observed. \nThe observed incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with sitagliptin was similar to placebo. \nBody weight did not increase from baseline with sitagliptin therapy in either study, compared to a \nsmall reduction in patients given placebo.\n\nSitagliptin 100 mg once daily provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared\nwith placebo in two 24-week studies of sitagliptin as add-on therapy, one in combination with \nmetformin and one in combination with pioglitazone. Change from baseline in body weight was \nsimilar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to placebo. In these studies there was a similar \nincidence of hypoglycaemia reported for patients treated with sitagliptin or placebo.\n\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin\n(100 mg once daily) added to glimepiride alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin. The \naddition of sitagliptin to either glimepiride alone or to glimepiride and metformin provided significant \nimprovements in glycaemic parameters. Patients treated with sitagliptin had a modest increase in body \nweight compared to those given placebo.\n\nA 26-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin \n(100 mg once daily) added to the combination of pioglitazone and metformin. The addition of \nsitagliptin to pioglitazone and metformin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters. \nChange from baseline in body weight was similar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to \nplacebo. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was also similar in patients treated with sitagliptin or \nplacebo.\n\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin\n(100 mg once daily) added to insulin (at a stable dose for at least 10 weeks) with or without \nmetformin (at least 1,500 mg). In patients taking pre-mixed insulin, the mean daily dose was \n\n \n\n\n\n42\n\n70.9 U/day. In patients taking non-pre-mixed (intermediate/long-acting) insulin, the mean daily dose \nwas 44.3 U/day. The addition of sitagliptin to insulin provided significant improvements in glycaemic \nparameters. There was no meaningful change from baseline in body weight in either group.\n\nIn a 24-week placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy, sitagliptin 50 mg twice daily in \ncombination with metformin (500 mg or 1,000 mg twice daily) provided significant improvements in \nglycaemic parameters compared with either monotherapy. The decrease in body weight with the \ncombination of sitagliptin and metformin was similar to that observed with metformin alone or \nplacebo; there was no change from baseline for patients on sitagliptin alone. The incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.\n\nTable 2.

Treatment by stratum (metformin and insulin use) interactions were not \nsignificant (p > 0.10).\n\nA 24-week active (metformin)-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of \nsitagliptin 100 mg once daily (N=528) compared to metformin (N=522) in patients with inadequate \nglycaemic control on diet and exercise and who were not on anti-hyperglycaemic therapy (off therapy \nfor at least 4 months). The mean dose of metformin was approximately 1,900 mg per day. The \nreduction in HbA1c from mean baseline values of 7.2 % was -0.43 % for sitagliptin and -0.57 % for \nmetformin (Per Protocol Analysis). The overall incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions\nconsidered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin was 2.7 % compared with 12.6 % in \npatients treated with metformin. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was not significantly different \nbetween the treatment groups (sitagliptin, 1.3 %; metformin, 1.9 %). Body weight decreased from \nbaseline in both groups (sitagliptin, -0.6 kg; metformin -1.9 kg).\n\nIn a study comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or \nglipizide (a sulphonylurea) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, \nsitagliptin was similar to glipizide in reducing HbA1c. The mean glipizide dose used in the comparator \ngroup was 10 mg per day with approximately 40 % of patients requiring a glipizide dose of \n\uf0a3 5 mg/day throughout the study. However, more patients in the sitagliptin group discontinued due to \nlack of efficacy than in the glipizide group. Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant \nmean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients \nadministered glipizide (-1.5 vs. +1.1 kg). In this study, the proinsulin to insulin ratio, a marker of \nefficiency of insulin synthesis and release, improved with sitagliptin and deteriorated with glipizide \ntreatment. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9 %) was significantly lower \nthan that in the glipizide group (32.0 %).\n\nA 24-week placebo-controlled study involving 660 patients was designed to evaluate the \ninsulin-sparing efficacy and safety of sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) added to insulin glargine with or \nwithout metformin (at least 1,500 mg) during intensification of insulin therapy. Baseline HbA1c was \n8.74 % and baseline insulin dose was 37 IU/day. Patients were instructed to titrate their insulin \nglargine dose based on fingerstick fasting glucose values. At Week 24, the increase in daily insulin \ndose was 19 IU/day in patients treated with sitagliptin and 24 IU/day in patients treated with placebo. \nThe reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without metformin) \nwas -1.31 % compared to -0.87 % in patients treated with placebo and insulin (with or without \nmetformin), a difference of -0.45 % [95 % CI: -0.60, -0.29]. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was \n25.2 % in patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without metformin) and 36.8 % in \npatients treated with placebo and insulin (with or without metformin). The difference was mainly due \nto a higher percentage of patients in the placebo group experiencing 3 or more episodes of \nhypoglycaemia (9.4 vs. 19.1 %). There was no difference in the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia.\n\nA study comparing sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once daily to glipizide at 2.5 to 20 mg/day was \nconducted in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. This study involved 423 patients with\n\n \n\n\n\n44\n\nchronic renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min). After 54 weeks, the \nmean reduction from baseline in HbA1c was -0.76 % with sitagliptin and -0.64 % with glipizide (Per-\nProtocol Analysis). In this study, the efficacy and safety profile of sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once \ndaily was generally similar to that observed in other monotherapy studies in patients with normal \nrenal function. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (6.2 %) was significantly \nlower than that in the glipizide group (17.0 %). There was also a significant difference between \ngroups with respect to change from baseline body weight (sitagliptin -0.6 kg; glipizide +1.2 kg).\n\nAnother study comparing sitagliptin at 25 mg once daily to glipizide at 2.5 to 20 mg/day was \nconducted in 129 patients with ESRD who were on dialysis. After 54 weeks, the mean reduction from \nbaseline in HbA1c was -0.72 % with sitagliptin and -0.87 % with glipizide. In this study, the efficacy \nand safety profile of sitagliptin at 25 mg once daily was generally similar to that observed in other \nmonotherapy studies in patients with normal renal function. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was not \nsignificantly different between the treatment groups (sitagliptin, 6.3 %; glipizide, 10.8 %).\n\nIn another study involving 91 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 50 mL/min), the safety and tolerability of treatment with sitagliptin at 25 or 50 mg once \ndaily were generally similar to placebo. In addition, after 12 weeks, the mean reductions in HbA1c\n(sitagliptin -0.59 %; placebo -0.18 %) and FPG (sitagliptin -25.5 mg/dL; placebo -3.0 mg/dL) were \ngenerally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies in patients with normal renal \nfunction (see section 5.2).\n\nThe TECOS was a randomised in 14,671 patients in the intention-to-treat population with an HbA1c of \n\u2265 6.5 to 8.0 % with established CV disease who received sitagliptin (7,332) 100 mg daily (or 50 mg \ndaily if the baseline eGFR was \u2265 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2) or placebo (7,339) added to usual care \ntargeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. Patients with an eGFR \n< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were not to be enrolled in the study. The study population included \n2,004 patients \u2265 75 years of age and 3,324 patients with renal impairment \n(eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).\n\nOver the course of the study, the overall estimated mean (SD) difference in HbA1c between the \nsitagliptin and placebo groups was 0.29 % (0.01), 95 % CI (-0.32, -0.27); p < 0.001. \n\nThe primary cardiovascular endpoint was a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, \nnonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina. Secondary \ncardiovascular endpoints included the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial \ninfarction, or nonfatal stroke; first occurrence of the individual components of the primary composite; \nall-cause mortality; and hospital admissions for congestive heart failure.\n\nAfter a median follow up of 3 years, sitagliptin, when added to usual care, did not increase the risk of \nmajor adverse cardiovascular events or the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure compared to usual \ncare without sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (Table 3).\n\nTable 3.

Patients were randomised to sitagliptin \n100 mg once daily or placebo for 20 weeks.\n\nMean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%. Treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg did not provide significant \nimprovement in HbA1c at 20 weeks. The reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin \n(N=95) was 0.0% compared to 0.2% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.2%\n(95% CI: -0.7, 0.3). See section 4.2.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, \nwith peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose, mean plasma AUC \nof sitagliptin was 8.52 \uf06dM\u2022hr, Cmax was 950 nM. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is \napproximately 87 %. Since co-administration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics, TESAVEL may be administered with or without food.\n\nPlasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner. Dose-proportionality was not \nestablished for Cmax and C24hr (Cmax increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner and C24hr\nincreased in a less than dose-proportional manner).\n\n \n\n\n\n46\n\nDistribution\nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of \nsitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 litres. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound \nto plasma proteins is low (38 %).\n\nBiotransformation\nSitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway. \nApproximately 79 % of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine.\n\nFollowing a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16 % of the radioactivity was excreted as \nmetabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to \ncontribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the \nprimary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution \nfrom CYP2C8.\n\nIn vitro data showed that sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, \n1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.\n\nElimination\nFollowing administration of an oral [14C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100 % of \nthe administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (13 %) or urine (87 %) within one week of \ndosing. The apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately \n12.4 hours. Sitagliptin accumulates only minimally with multiple doses. The renal clearance was \napproximately 350 mL/min.\n\nElimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion.\nSitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in \nthe renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not \nbeen established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in \nmediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, ciclosporin, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did \nnot reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin is not a substrate for OCT2 or OAT1 or \nPEPT1/2 transporters. In vitro, sitagliptin did not inhibit OAT3 (IC50=160 \uf06dM) or p-glycoprotein (up \nto 250 \uf06dM) mediated transport at therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations. In a clinical study \nsitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations indicating that sitagliptin may be a \nmild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein.\n\nCharacteristics in patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with \ntype 2 diabetes.\n\nRenal impairment\nA single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a reduced dose of \nsitagliptin (50 mg) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to normal \nhealthy control subjects. The study included patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal \nimpairment, as well as patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. In addition, the effects of renal \nimpairment on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate, or \nsevere renal impairment (including ESRD) were assessed using population pharmacokinetic analyses.\n\nCompared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased by \napproximately 1.2-fold and 1.6-fold in patients with mild renal impairment (GFR \u2265 60 to \n< 90 mL/min) and patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR \u2265 45 to < 60 mL/min), respectively. \nBecause increases of this magnitude are not clinically relevant, dosage adjustment in these patients is \nnot necessary.\n\nPlasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased approximately 2-fold in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment (GFR \u2265 30 to < 45 mL/min), and approximately 4-fold in patients with severe renal \n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nimpairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), including in patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. Sitagliptin was \nmodestly removed by haemodialysis (13.5 % over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session starting\n4 hours postdose). To achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in patients with \nnormal renal function, lower dosages are recommended in patients with GFR < 45 mL/min (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment for TESAVEL is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh score \uf0a3 9). There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh score > 9). However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, \nsevere hepatic impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the \npharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and \nPhase II data. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19 % higher plasma concentrations \nof sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin (single dose of 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg) were investigated in \npaediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. In this population, the dose-adjusted\nAUC of sitagliptin in plasma was approximately 18 % lower compared to adult patients with type 2 \ndiabetes for a 100 mg dose. This is not considered to be a clinically meaningful difference compared \nto adult patients based on the flat PK/PD relationship between the dose of 50 mg and 100 mg. No \nstudies with sitagliptin have been performed in paediatric patients with age <10 years.\n\nOther patient characteristics\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, race, or body mass index (BMI). These \ncharacteristics had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a \ncomposite analysis of Phase I pharmacokinetic data and on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of \nPhase I and Phase II data.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRenal and liver toxicity were observed in rodents at systemic exposure values 58 times the human \nexposure level, while the no-effect level was found at 19 times the human exposure level. Incisor teeth\nabnormalities were observed in rats at exposure levels 67 times the clinical exposure level; the \nno-effect level for this finding was 58-fold based on the 14-week rat study. The relevance of these \nfindings for humans is unknown. Transient treatment-related physical signs, some of which suggest \nneural toxicity, such as open-mouth breathing, salivation, white foamy emesis, ataxia, trembling, \ndecreased activity, and/or hunched posture were observed in dogs at exposure levels approximately \n23 times the clinical exposure level. In addition, very slight to slight skeletal muscle degeneration was \nalso observed histologically at doses resulting in systemic exposure levels of approximately 23 times \nthe human exposure level. A no-effect level for these findings was found at an exposure 6-fold the \nclinical exposure level.\n\nSitagliptin has not been demonstrated to be genotoxic in preclinical studies. Sitagliptin was not \ncarcinogenic in mice. In rats, there was an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas at \nsystemic exposure levels 58 times the human exposure level. Since hepatotoxicity has been shown to \ncorrelate with induction of hepatic neoplasia in rats, this increased incidence of hepatic tumours in \nrats was likely secondary to chronic hepatic toxicity at this high dose. Because of the high safety \nmargin (19-fold at this no-effect level), these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the \nsituation in humans.\n\nNo adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin prior to and \nthroughout mating.\n\n \n\n\n\n48\n\nIn a pre-/postnatal development study performed in rats sitagliptin showed no adverse effects.\n\nReproductive toxicity studies showed a slight treatment-related increased incidence of foetal rib \nmalformations (absent, hypoplastic and wavy ribs) in the offspring of rats at systemic exposure levels\nmore than 29 times the human exposure levels. Maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits at more than \n29 times the human exposure levels. Because of the high safety margins, these findings do not suggest \na relevant risk for human reproduction. Sitagliptin is secreted in considerable amounts into the milk of \nlactating rats (milk/plasma ratio: 4:1).\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n \n\n\n\n64\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient\n\nTESAVEL 25 mg film-coated tablets\nsitagliptin\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What TESAVEL is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take TESAVEL\n3. How to take TESAVEL\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store TESAVEL\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What TESAVEL is and what it is used for\n\nTESAVEL contains the active substance sitagliptin which is a member of a class of medicines called \nDPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) that lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nThis medicine helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal and decreases the amount \nof sugar made by the body.\n\nYour doctor has prescribed this medicine to help lower your blood sugar, which is too high because of \nyour type 2 diabetes. This medicine can be used alone or in combination with certain other medicines \n(insulin, metformin, sulphonylureas, or glitazones) that lower blood sugar, which you may already be \ntaking for your diabetes together with a food and exercise plan.\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that \nyour body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. \nWhen this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems \nlike heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take TESAVEL\n\nDo not take TESAVEL\n- if you are allergic to sitagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nCases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving \nTESAVEL (see section 4).\n\n \n\n\n\n65\n\nIf you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. \nYour doctor may ask you to stop TESAVEL.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have had:\n- a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis)\n- gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of fat) in your blood. \n\nThese medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis (see section 4).\n- type 1 diabetes\n- diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid weight loss, \n\nnausea or vomiting)\n- any past or present kidney problems\n- an allergic reaction to TESAVEL (see section 4)\n\nThis medicine is unlikely to cause low blood sugar because it does not work when your blood sugar is \nlow. However, when this medicine is used in combination with a sulphonylurea medicine or with\ninsulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your \nsulphonylurea or insulin medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nChildren and adolescents below 18 years should not use this medicine. It is not effective in children \nand adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years. It is not known if this medicine is safe and\neffective when used in children younger than 10 years.\n\nOther medicines and TESAVEL\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat irregular heart beat \nand other heart problems). The level of digoxin in your blood may need to be checked if taking with \nTESAVEL.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nYou should not take this medicine during pregnancy.\n\nIt is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. You should not take this medicine if you are \nbreast-feeding or plan to breast-feed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \ndizziness and drowsiness have been reported, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nTaking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause \nhypoglycaemia, which may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work without safe \nfoothold.\n\nTESAVEL contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3. How to take TESAVEL\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\n \n\n\n\n66\n\nThe usual recommended dose is:\n\uf02d one 100 mg film-coated tablet \n\uf02d once a day\n\uf02d by mouth\n\nIf you have kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe lower doses (such as 25 mg or 50 mg).\n\nYou can take this medicine with or without food and drink.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe this medicine alone or with certain other medicines that lower blood sugar.\n\nDiet and exercise can help your body use its blood sugar better. It is important to stay on the diet and \nexercise recommended by your doctor while taking TESAVEL.\n\nIf you take more TESAVEL than you should\nIf you take more than the prescribed dosage of this medicine, contact your doctor immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take TESAVEL\nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until it is time for your \nnext dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule.

What you need to know before you take TESAVEL\n3. How to take TESAVEL\n4. Possible side effects\n5 How to store TESAVEL\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What TESAVEL is and what it is used for\n\nTESAVEL contains the active substance sitagliptin which is a member of a class of medicines called \nDPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) that lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nThis medicine helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal and decreases the amount \nof sugar made by the body.\n\nYour doctor has prescribed this medicine to help lower your blood sugar, which is too high because of \nyour type 2 diabetes. This medicine can be used alone or in combination with certain other medicines \n(insulin, metformin, sulphonylureas, or glitazones) that lower blood sugar, which you may already be \ntaking for your diabetes together with a food and exercise plan.\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that \nyour body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. \nWhen this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems \nlike heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take TESAVEL\n\nDo not take TESAVEL\n- if you are allergic to sitagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nCases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving \nTESAVEL (see section 4).\n\n \n\n\n\n71\n\nIf you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. \nYour doctor may ask you to stop TESAVEL.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have had:\n- a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis)\n- gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of fat) in your blood. \n\nThese medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis (see section 4).\n- type 1 diabetes\n- diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid weight loss, \n\nnausea or vomiting)\n- any past or present kidney problems\n- an allergic reaction to TESAVEL (see section 4)\n\nThis medicine is unlikely to cause low blood sugar because it does not work when your blood sugar is \nlow. However, when this medicine is used in combination with a sulphonylurea medicine or with \ninsulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your \nsulphonylurea or insulin medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nChildren and adolescents below 18 years should not use this medicine. It is not effective in children \nand adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years. It is not known if this medicine is safe and\neffective when used in children younger than 10 years.\n\nOther medicines and TESAVEL\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat irregular heart beat \nand other heart problems). The level of digoxin in your blood may need to be checked if taking with \nTESAVEL.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\nYou should not use this medicine during pregnancy.\n\nIt is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. You should not take this medicine if you are \nbreast-feeding or plan to breast-feed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \ndizziness and drowsiness have been reported, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nTaking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause \nhypoglycaemia, which may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work without safe \nfoothold.\n\nTESAVEL contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3. How to take TESAVEL\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\n \n\n\n\n72\n\nThe usual recommended dose is:\n\uf02d one 100 mg film-coated tablet \n\uf02d once a day\n\uf02d by mouth\n\nIf you have kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe lower doses (such as 25 mg or 50 mg).\n\nYou can take this medicine with or without food and drink.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe this medicine alone or with certain other medicines that lower blood sugar.\n\nDiet and exercise can help your body use its blood sugar better. It is important to stay on the diet and\nexercise recommended by your doctor while taking TESAVEL.\n\nIf you take more TESAVEL than you should\nIf you take more than the prescribed dosage of this medicine, contact your doctor immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take TESAVEL\nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until it is time for your \nnext dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose of\nthis medicine.\n\nIf you stop taking TESAVEL\nContinue to take this medicine as long as your doctor prescribes it so you can continue to help control \nyour blood sugar. You should not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor first. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

What you need to know before you take TESAVEL\n3. How to take TESAVEL\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store TESAVEL\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What TESAVEL is and what it is used for\n\nTESAVEL contains the active substance sitagliptin which is a member of a class of medicines called \nDPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) that lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nThis medicine helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal and decreases the amount \nof sugar made by the body.\n\nYour doctor has prescribed this medicine to help lower your blood sugar, which is too high because of \nyour type 2 diabetes. This medicine can be used alone or in combination with certain other medicines \n(insulin, metformin, sulphonylureas, or glitazones) that lower blood sugar, which you may already be \ntaking for your diabetes together with a food and exercise plan.\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that \nyour body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. \nWhen this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems \nlike heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take TESAVEL\n\nDo not take TESAVEL\n- if you are allergic to sitagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nCases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving \nTESAVEL (see section 4).\n\n \n\n\n\n77\n\nIf you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. \nYour doctor may ask you to stop TESAVEL.\n\nTell your doctor if you have or have had:\n- a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis)\n- gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of fat) in your blood. \n\nThese medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis (see section 4).\n- type 1 diabetes\n- diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid weight loss, \n\nnausea or vomiting)\n- any past or present kidney problems\n- an allergic reaction to TESAVEL (see section 4)\n\nThis medicine is unlikely to cause low blood sugar because it does not work when your blood sugar is \nlow. However, when this medicine is used in combination with a sulphonylurea medicine or with\ninsulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your \nsulphonylurea or insulin medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nChildren and adolescents below 18 years should not use this medicine. It is not effective in children \nand adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years. It is not known if this medicine is safe and\neffective when used in children younger than 10 years.\n\nOther medicines and TESAVEL\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat irregular heart beat \nand other heart problems). The level of digoxin in your blood may need to be checked if taking with \nTESAVEL.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\nYou should not take this medicine during pregnancy.\n\nIt is not known if this medicine passes into breast milk. You should not take this medicine if you are \nbreast-feeding or plan to breast-feed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \ndizziness and drowsiness have been reported, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nTaking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause \nhypoglycaemia, which may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work without safe\nfoothold.\n\nTESAVEL contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3. How to take TESAVEL\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\n \n\n\n\n78\n\nThe usual recommended dose is:\n\uf02d one 100 mg film-coated tablet \n\uf02d once a day\n\uf02d by mouth\n\nIf you have kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe lower doses (such as 25 mg or 50 mg).\n\nYou can take this medicine with or without food and drink.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe this medicine alone or with certain other medicines that lower blood sugar.\n\nDiet and exercise can help your body use its blood sugar better. It is important to stay on the diet and\nexercise recommended by your doctor while taking TESAVEL.\n\nIf you take more TESAVEL than you should\nIf you take more than the prescribed dosage of this medicine, contact your doctor immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take TESAVEL\nIf you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until it is time for your \nnext dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose of \nthis medicine.\n\nIf you stop taking TESAVEL\nContinue to take this medicine as long as your doctor prescribes it so you can continue to help control \nyour blood sugar. You should not stop taking this medicine without talking to your doctor first. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nSTOP taking TESAVEL and contact a doctor immediately if you notice any of the following serious\nside effects:\n\uf0b7 Severe and persistent pain in the abdomen (stomach area) which might reach through to your \n\nback with or without nausea and vomiting, as these could be signs of an inflamed pancreas \n(pancreatitis).\n\nIf you have a serious allergic reaction (frequency not known), including rash, hives, blisters on the \nskin/peeling skin and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in \nbreathing or swallowing, stop taking this medicine and call your doctor right away.
