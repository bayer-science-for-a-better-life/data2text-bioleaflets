PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOrodispersible tablet \n \nYellow, round, freeze dried, rapid-dispersing preparation to be placed in the mouth or alternatively to \nbe dispersed in water or other suitable beverage for administration. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAdults \nOlanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. \n \nOlanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in \npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. \n \nOlanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode. \n \nIn patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment, olanzapine is indicated for the \nprevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAdults \n \nSchizophrenia: The recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg/day. \n \nManic episode: The starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in \ncombination therapy (see section 5.1). \n \nPreventing recurrence in bipolar disorder: The recommended starting dose is 10 mg/day. For patients \nwho have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode, continue therapy for preventing \nrecurrence at the same dose. If a new manic, mixed, or depressive episode occurs, olanzapine \ntreatment should be continued (with dose optimisation as needed), with supplementary therapy to treat \nmood symptoms, as clinically indicated. \n \nDuring treatment for schizophrenia, manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder, daily \ndosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5-\n20 mg/day. An increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after \nappropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours. \nOlanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food. Gradual \ntapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine. \n \nZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth, where it will rapidly \ndisperse in saliva, so it can be easily swallowed. Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the \nmouth is difficult. Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening \nthe blister. Alternatively, it may be dispersed in a full glass of water or other suitable beverage (orange \njuice, apple juice, milk or coffee) immediately before administration.  \n \nOlanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets, with a similar rate and \nextent of absorption. It has the same dosage and frequency of administration as olanzapine coated \ntablets. Olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nA lower starting dose (5 mg/day) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and \nover when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \nA lower starting dose (5 mg) should be considered for such patients. In cases of moderate hepatic \ninsufficiency (cirrhosis, Child-Pugh Class A or B), the starting dose should be 5 mg and only \nincreased with caution. \n \nSmokers \nThe starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers. The \nmetabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking. Clinical monitoring is recommended and an \nincrease of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nWhen more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism (female gender, \ngeriatric age, non-smoking status), consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose. Dose \nescalation, when indicated, should be conservative in such patients. \n \nIn cases where dose increments of 2.5 mg are considered necessary, ZYPREXA coated tablets should \nbe used. \n \n(See sections 4.5 and 5.2.) \n \nPaediatric population \nOlanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a \nlack of data on safety and efficacy. A greater magnitude of weight gain, lipid and prolactin alterations \nhas been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients (see \nsections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.   \nPatients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days \nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored during this period. \n \nDementia-related psychosis and/or behavioural disturbances \nOlanzapine is not recommended for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis and/or behavioural \ndisturbances because of an increase in mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular accident. In placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trials (6-12 weeks duration) of elderly patients (mean age 78 years) with dementia-\nrelated psychosis and/or disturbed behaviours, there was a 2-fold increase in the incidence of death in \nolanzapine-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo (3.5% vs. 1.5 %, respectively). \nThe higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose (mean daily dose 4.4 mg) or \nduration of treatment. Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality \ninclude age > 65 years, dysphagia, sedation, malnutrition and dehydration, pulmonary conditions (e.g., \npneumonia, with or without aspiration), or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. However, the \nincidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of \nthese risk factors. \n \nIn the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e.g., stroke, transient ischemic \nattack), including fatalities, were reported. There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated \nwith olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo (1.3 % vs. 0.4 %, respectively). All \nolanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing \nrisk factors. Age > 75 years and vascular/mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for \nCVAE in association with olanzapine treatment. The efficacy of olanzapine was not established in \nthese trials. \n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nParkinson's disease \nThe use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with \nParkinson's disease is not recommended. In clinical trials, worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology \nand hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo (see section \n4.8), and olanzapine was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. In \nthese trials, patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-\nParkinsonian medicinal products (dopamine agonist) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian \nmedicinal products and dosages throughout the study. Olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg/day and \ntitrated to a maximum of 15 mg/day based on investigator judgement. \n \nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)  \nNMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal products. Rare \ncases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine. Clinical manifestations \nof NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability \n(irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional \nsigns may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal \nfailure. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained \nhigh fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicines, including \nolanzapine must be discontinued. \n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes \nHyperglycaemia and/or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with \nketoacidosis or coma has been reported uncommonly, including some fatal cases (see section 4.8). In \nsome cases, a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor. \nAppropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines, e.g. \nmeasuring of blood glucose at baseline, 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and annually \nthereafter.  Patients treated with any antipsychotic medicines, including ZYPREXA VELOTAB, \nshould be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, \npolyphagia, and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus \nshould be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Weight should be monitored \nregularly, e.g. at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and quarterly \nthereafter. \n \nLipid alterations \nUndesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trials (see section 4.8). Lipid alterations should be managed as clinically \nappropriate, particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development \nof lipids disorders. Patients treated with any antipsychotic medicines, including ZYPREXA \nVELOTAB, should be monitored regularly for lipids in accordance with utilised antipsychotic \nguidelines, e.g. at baseline, 12 weeks after starting olanzapine treatment and every 5 years thereafter. \n \nAnticholinergic activity  \nWhile olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro, experience during the clinical trials \nrevealed a low incidence of related events. However, as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients \nwith concomitant illness is limited, caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic \nhypertrophy, or paralytic ileus and related conditions. \n \nHepatic function \nTransient, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic aminotransferases, ALT, AST have been seen \ncommonly, especially in early treatment. Caution should be exercised and follow-up organised in \npatients with elevated ALT and/or AST, in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment, in \npatients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve, and in patients \nwho are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines. In cases where hepatitis (including \nhepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed liver injury) has been diagnosed, olanzapine treatment should be \ndiscontinued. \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nNeutropenia \nCaution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/or neutrophil counts for any reason, in \npatients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced \nbone marrow depression/toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant \nillness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with \nmyeloproliferative disease. Neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate \nare used concomitantly (see section 4.8).  \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nAcute symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea, or vomiting have been reported \nrarely ( \u2265 0.01 % and <  0.1 %) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly.  \n \nQT interval \nIn clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] \n\u2265 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were \nuncommon (0.1 % to 1 %) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in \nassociated cardiac events compared to placebo. However, caution should be exercised when \nolanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, in \npatients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia \nor hypomagnesaemia. \n \nThromboembolism \nTemporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has been reported \nuncommonly (\u2265 0.1% and < 1%). A causal relationship between the occurrence of venous \nthromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established. However, since patients \nwith schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible \nrisk factors of VTE e.g. immobilisation of patients, should be identified and preventive measures \nundertaken. \n \nGeneral CNS activity \nGiven the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when it is taken in combination \nwith other centrally acting medicines and alcohol. As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism, \nolanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists. \n\nSeizures \nOlanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to \nfactors which may lower the seizure threshold. Seizures have been reported to occur uncommonly in \npatients when treated with olanzapine. In most of these cases, a history of seizures or risk factors for \nseizures were reported. \n \nTardive Dyskinesia \nIn comparator studies of one year or less duration, olanzapine was associated with a statistically \nsignificant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia. However the risk of tardive dyskinesia \nincreases with long term exposure, and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in \na patient on olanzapine, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. These symptoms \ncan temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment.  \n \nPostural hypotension \nPostural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials. It is \nrecommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years. \n \nSudden cardiac death  \nIn postmarketing reports with olanzapine, the event of sudden cardiac death has been reported in \npatients with olanzapine. In a retrospective observational cohort study, the risk of presumed sudden \ncardiac death in patients treated with olanzapine was approximately twice the risk in patients not using \nantipsychotics. In the study, the risk of olanzapine was comparable to the risk of atypical \nantipsychotics included in a pooled analysis. \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nOlanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents. Studies in patients \naged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions, including weight gain, changes in metabolic \nparameters and increases in prolactin levels(see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPhenylalanine \nZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablet contains aspartame, which is a source of phenylalanine. \nMay be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. \n \nMannitol \nZYPREXA VELOTAB orodispersible tablet contains mannitol. \n \nSodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium propyl parahydroxybenzoate \nOlanzapine orodispersible tablet contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium propyl \nparahydroxybenzoate. These preservatives are known to cause urticaria. Generally, delayed type \nreactions such as contact dermatitis may occur, but rarely immediate reactions with bronchospasm \nmay occur. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nPotential interactions affecting olanzapine \nSince olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2, substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this \nisoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.  \n \nInduction of CYP1A2 \nThe metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine, which may lead to \nreduced olanzapine concentrations. Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been \nobserved. The clinical consequences are likely to be limited, but clinical monitoring is recommended \nand an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.2). \n \nInhibition of CYP1A2 \nFluvoxamine, a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor, has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of \nolanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 % in female non-\nsmokers and 77 % in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % \nrespectively. A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using \nfluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as ciprofloxacin. A decrease in the dose of \nolanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated. \n \nDecreased bioavailability \nActivated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at \nleast 2 hours before or after olanzapine. \n \nFluoxetine (a CYP2D6 inhibitor), single doses of antacid (aluminium, magnesium) or cimetidine have \nnot been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. \n \nPotential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products \nOlanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists. \n \nOlanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro (e.g. 1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4). \nThus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of \nmetabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant (representing mostly \nCYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or diazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).  \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nOlanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden. \n \nTherapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is \nrequired after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine. \n \nGeneral CNS activity \nCaution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can \ncause central nervous system depression. \n \nThe concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with \nParkinson's disease and dementia is not recommended (see section 4.4).  \n \nQTc interval \nCaution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products \nknown to increase QTc interval (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Patients should be advised to \nnotify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with \nolanzapine. Nevertheless, because human experience is limited, olanzapine should be used in \npregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nNew born infants exposed to antipsychotics (including olanzapine) during the third trimester of \npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborns \nshould be monitored carefully. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIn a study in breast-feeding, healthy women, olanzapine was excreted in breast milk. Mean infant \nexposure (mg/kg) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 % of the maternal olanzapine dose (mg/kg). \nPatients should be advised not to breast feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine. \n \nFertility \nEffects on fertility are unknown (see section 5.3 for preclinical information). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Because \nolanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness, patients should be cautioned about operating \nmachinery, including motor vehicles. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n  \nAdults \nThe most frequently (seen in \u2265 1% of patients ) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of \nolanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence, weight gain, eosinophilia, elevated prolactin, \ncholesterol, glucose and triglyceride levels (see section 4.4), glucosuria, increased appetite, dizziness, \nakathisia, parkinsonism, leukopenia, neutropenia (see section 4.4), dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, \nanticholinergic effects, transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic aminotransferases (see section \n4.4), rash, asthenia, fatigue, pyrexia, arthralgia, increased alkaline phosphatase, high gamma \nglutamyltransferase, high uric acid, high creatine phosphokinase and oedema. \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following table lists the adverse reactions  and laboratory investigations observed from spontaneous \nreporting and in clinical trials. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order \nof decreasing seriousness. The frequency terms listed are defined as follows: Very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the data available). \n \nVery \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon  Rare Not known \n\nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders  \n Eosinophilia \n\nLeukopenia10 \nNeutropenia10 \n\n Thrombocytopenia11  \n\nImmune system disorders  \n  Hypersensitivity11   \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \nWeight gain1 Elevated \n\ncholesterol levels2,3 \nElevated glucose \nlevels4 \nElevated \ntriglyceride levels2,5 \nGlucosuria  \nIncreased appetite \n\nDevelopment or \nexacerbation of \ndiabetes occasionally \nassociated with \nketoacidosis or coma, \nincluding some fatal \ncases (see section \n4.4) 11 \n\nHypothermia12  \n\nNervous system disorders  \nSomnolence Dizziness \n\nAkathisia6 \nParkinsonism6 \nDyskinesia6 \n\nSeizures where in \nmost cases a history \nof seizures or risk \nfactors for seizures \nwere reported11 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDystonia (including \noculogyration) 11 \nTardive dyskinesia11 \n \n \nAmnesia 9 \n \n\nDysarthria \nStuttering11 \nRestless Legs \nSyndrome11 \n\nNeuroleptic malignant \nsyndrome (see section \n4.4)12  \n \nDiscontinuation \nsymptoms7, 12 \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders  \n  Bradycardia \n\nQTc prolongation (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nVentricular \ntachycardia/fibrillation, \nsudden death (see \nsection 4.4)11 \n\n \n\nVascular disorders  \nOrthostatic \nhypotension10 \n\n Thromboembolism \n(including pulmonary \nembolism and deep \nvein thrombosis) (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n  \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders  \n  Epistaxis9   \nGastrointestinal disorders  \n Mild, transient \n\nanticholinergic \neffects including \nconstipation and \ndry mouth \n\nAbdominal \ndistension9 \nSalivary \nhypersecretion11 \n\nPancreatitis11  \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  \n Transient, \n\nasymptomatic \nelevations of \nhepatic \naminotransferases \n(ALT, AST), \nespecially in early \ntreatment (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n Hepatitis (including \nhepatocellular, \ncholestatic or mixed \nliver injury)11 \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n Rash Photosensitivity \n\nreaction \nAlopecia \n\n Drug \nReaction \nwith \nEosinophilia \nand \nSystemic \nSymptoms \n(DRESS) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  \n Arthralgia9  Rhabdomyolysis11  \nRenal and urinary disorders  \n  Urinary incontinence, \n\nurinary retention \nUrinary hesitation11 \n\n  \n\nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions  \n    Drug \n\nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \nneonatal (see \nsection 4.6) \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders  \n Erectile dysfunction \n\nin males \nDecreased libido in \nmales and females \n\nAmenorrhea \nBreast enlargement \nGalactorrhea in \nfemales \nGynaecomastia/breast \nenlargement in males \n\nPriapism12  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions  \n Asthenia \n\nFatigue \nOedema \nPyrexia10 \n\n   \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nInvestigations  \nElevated \nplasma \nprolactin \nlevels8 \n\nIncreased alkaline \nphosphatase10 \nHigh creatine \nphosphokinase11 \nHigh Gamma \nGlutamyltransferase \n10 \n\nHigh uric acid 10 \n \n\nIncreased total \nbilirubin \n\n  \n\n \n1 Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) \ncategories. Following short term treatment (median duration 47 days), weight gain \u2265 7% of baseline \nbody weight  was very common (22.2 %), \u2265 15 % was common (4.2 %) and \u2265 25 % was uncommon \n(0.8 %). Patients gaining \u2265 7 %, \u2265 15 % and \u2265 25 % of their baseline body weight with long-term \nexposure (at least 48 weeks) were very common (64.4 %, 31.7 % and 12.3 % respectively). \n \n2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were \ngreater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline. \n \n3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 5.17 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 6.2 mmol/l). Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline (\u2265 5.17 - \n< 6.2 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 6.2 mmol/l) were very common. \n \n4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 5.56 mmol/l) which increased to high (\u2265 7 mmol/l). \nChanges in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline (\u2265 5.56 - < 7 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 7 mmol/l) were \nvery common.  \n \n5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.69 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 2.26 mmol/l). Changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (\u2265 1.69 mmol/l - \n< 2.26 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 2.26 mmol/l) were very common. \n \n6 In clinical trials, the incidence of Parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was \nnumerically higher, but not statistically significantly different from placebo. Olanzapine-treated patients \nhad a lower incidence of Parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of \nhaloperidol. In the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and \ntardive extrapyramidal movement disorders, it cannot be concluded at present that olanzapine produces \nless tardive dyskinesia and/or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes. \n \n7 Acute symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea and vomiting have been \nreported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly. \n \n8 In clinical trials of up to 12 weeks, plasma prolactin concentrations exceeded the upper limit of \nnormal range in approximately 30% of olanzapine treated patients with normal baseline prolactin \nvalue. In the majority of these patients the elevations were generally mild, and remained below two \ntimes the upper limit of normal range.  \n \n9 Adverse event identified from clinical trials in the Olanzapine Integrated Database. \n \n10 As assessed by measured values from clinical trials in the Olanzapine Integrated Database. \n \n11 Adverse event identified from spontaneous post-marketing reporting with frequency determined \n\nutilising the Olanzapine Integrated Database. \n \n12 Adverse event identified from spontaneous post-marketing reporting with frequency estimated at the \nupper limit of the 95% confidence interval utilising the Olanzapine Integrated Database. \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n \nLong-term exposure (at least 48 weeks) \nThe proportion of patients who had adverse, clinically significant changes in weight gain, glucose, \ntotal/LDL/HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time. In adult patients who completed 9-12  \nmonths of therapy, the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 6 months. \n \nAdditional information on special populations \nIn clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia, olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher \nincidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo (see section 4.4). Very \ncommon adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal \ngait and falls. Pneumonia, increased body temperature, lethargy, erythema, visual hallucinations and \nurinary incontinence were observed commonly.  \n \nIn clinical trials in patients with drug-induced (dopamine agonist) psychosis associated with \nParkinson\u2019s disease, worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported \nvery commonly and more frequently than with placebo. \n \nIn one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania, valproate combination therapy with olanzapine \nresulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1%; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma \nvalproate levels. Olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels \n(\u2265 10%) of tremor, dry mouth, increased appetite, and weight gain. Speech disorder was also reported \ncommonly. During treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex, an increase \nof \u2265 7% from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4% of patients during acute treatment (up to 6 \nweeks). Long-term olanzapine treatment (up to 12 months) for recurrence prevention in patients with \nbipolar disorder was associated with an increase of \u2265 7% from baseline body weight in 39.9% of \npatients. \n \nPaediatric population \nOlanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years. \nAlthough no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted, data \nfrom the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials.  \n \nThe following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent \npatients (aged 13-17 years) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term \nclinical trials in adolescent patients. Clinically significant weight gain (\u2265 7%) appears to occur more \nfrequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures. The magnitude \nof weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain \nwere greater with long-term exposure (at least 24 weeks) than with short-term exposure.  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \nThe frequency terms listed are defined as follows: Very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10). \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Weight gain13, elevated triglyceride levels14, increased appetite. \nCommon: Elevated cholesterol levels15 \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Sedation (including: hypersomnia, lethargy, somnolence). \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Dry mouth \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Elevations of hepatic aminotransferases (ALT/AST; see section 4.4). \nInvestigations  \nVery common: Decreased total bilirubin, increased GGT, elevated plasma prolactin levels16. \n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n13 Following short term treatment (median duration 22 days), weight gain \u2265 7% of baseline body \nweight (kg) was very common (40.6 %), \u2265 15% of baseline body weight was common (7.1 %) and \u2265 \n25 % was common (2.5 %). With long-term exposure (at least 24 weeks), 89.4 % gained \u2265 7 %, 55.3 \n% gained \u2265 15 % and 29.1 % gained \u2265 25% of their baseline body weight.  \n \n14  Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/l) which increased to high \n(\u2265 1.467 mmol/l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (\u2265 1.016 mmol/l - \n< 1.467 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 1.467 mmol/l). \n \n15 Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline (< 4.39 mmol/l) to high \n(\u2265 5.17 mmol/l) were observed commonly. Changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline \nat baseline (\u2265 4.39 - < 5.17 mmol/l) to high (\u2265 5.17 mmol/l) were very common. \n \n16 Elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4% of adolescent patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \nVery common symptoms in overdose (> 10 % incidence) include tachycardia, \nagitation/aggressiveness, dysarthria, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of \nconsciousness ranging from sedation to coma.  \n \nOther medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium, convulsion, coma, possible \nneuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depression, aspiration, hypertension or hypotension, \ncardiac arrhythmias (< 2 % of overdose cases) and cardiopulmonary arrest. Fatal outcomes have been \nreported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute \noverdose of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine. \n \nManagement \nThere is no specific antidote for olanzapine. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Standard \nprocedures for management of overdose may be indicated (i.e. gastric lavage, administration of \nactivated charcoal). The concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the \noral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 %. \n \nSymptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to \nclinical presentation, including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of \nrespiratory function. Do not use epinephrine, dopamine, or other sympathomimetic agents with beta-\nagonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension. Cardiovascular monitoring is \nnecessary to detect possible arrhythmias. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue \nuntil the patient recovers. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: psycholeptics, diazepines, oxazepines, thiazepines and oxepines, ATC \ncode N05A H03. \n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \nOlanzapine is an antipsychotic, antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad \npharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems.  \n \nIn preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki < 100 nM) for serotonin 5 \nHT2A/2C, 5 HT3, 5 HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors M1-M5; \u03b11 \nadrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors. Animal behavioural studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT, \ndopamine, and cholinergic antagonism, consistent with the receptor-binding profile. Olanzapine \ndemonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 \nHT2 than D2 activity in vivo models. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine \nselectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic (A10) dopaminergic neurons, while having little effect on \nthe striatal (A9) pathways involved in motor function. Olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance \nresponse, a test indicative of antipsychotic activity, at doses below those producing catalepsy, an effect \nindicative of motor side-effects. Unlike some other antipsychotic agents, olanzapine increases \nresponding in an \u201canxiolytic\u201d test. \n \nIn a single oral dose (10 mg) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study in healthy volunteers, \nolanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy. In addition, a Single \nPhoton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging study in schizophrenic patients revealed \nthat olanzapine-responsive patients had lower striatal D2 occupancy than some other antipsychotic- \nand risperidone-responsive patients, while being comparable to clozapine-responsive patients. \n \nClinical efficacy  \nIn two of two placebo and two of three comparator controlled trials with over 2,900 schizophrenic \npatients presenting with both positive and negative symptoms, olanzapine was associated with \nstatistically significantly greater improvements in negative as well as positive symptoms.  \n \nIn a multinational, double-blind, comparative study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and related \ndisorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms \n(baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a prospective secondary \nanalysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant \nimprovement (p= 0.001) favouring olanzapine (-6.0) versus haloperidol (-3.1). \n \nIn patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, olanzapine demonstrated superior \nefficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium (divalproex) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 \nweeks. Olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the \nproportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks. In a \nco-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks, the addition \nof olanzapine 10 mg (co-therapy with lithium or valproate) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms \nof mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks. \n \nIn a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on \nolanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo, olanzapine demonstrated statistically \nsignificant superiority over placebo on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence. Olanzapine also \nshowed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into \nmania or recurrence into depression. \n \nIn a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission \nwith a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium \nalone, olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar \nrecurrence (olanzapine 30.0%, lithium 38.3%; p = 0.055). \n \nIn an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a \nmood stabiliser (lithium or valproate), long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was \nnot statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence, \ndefined according to syndromic (diagnostic) criteria. \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nControlled efficacy data in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) are limited to short term studies in \nschizophrenia (6 weeks) and mania associated with bipolar I disorder (3 weeks), involving less than \n200 adolescents. Olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to \n20 mg/day. During treatment with olanzapine, adolescents gained significantly more weight compared \nwith adults. The magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and \nprolactin (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) were greater in adolescents than in adults. There are no controlled \ndata on maintenance of effect or long term safety (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Information on long term \nsafety is primarily limited to open-label, uncontrolled data. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nOlanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets, with a similar rate and \nextent of absorption. Olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine \ncoated tablets. \n \nAbsorption \nOlanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to \n8 hours. The absorption is not affected by food. Absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous \nadministration has not been determined. \n \nDistribution \nThe plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 % over the concentration range of about 7 to \nabout 1000 ng/ml. Olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and \u03b11-acid-glycoprotein. \n \nBiotransformation \nOlanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways. The major circulating \nmetabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide, which does not pass the blood brain barrier. Cytochromes P450-\nCYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl \nmetabolites, both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in \nanimal studies. The predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine.  \n \nElimination \nAfter oral administration, the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects \nvaried on the basis of age and gender. \n \nIn healthy elderly (65 and over) versus non-elderly subjects, the mean elimination half-life was \nprolonged (51.8 versus 33.8 hr) and the clearance was reduced (17.5 versus 18.2 l/hr). The \npharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly. In 44 \npatients with schizophrenia > 65 years of age, dosing from 5 to 20 mg/day was not associated with any \ndistinguishing profile of adverse events. \n \nIn female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged (36.7 versus \n32.3 hrs) and the clearance was reduced (18.9 versus 27.3 l/hr). However, olanzapine (5-20 mg) \ndemonstrated a comparable safety profile in female (n=467) as in male patients (n=869). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn renally impaired patients (creatinine clearance < 10 ml/min) versus healthy subjects, there was no \nsignificant difference in mean elimination half-life (37.7 versus 32.4 hr) or clearance (21.2 versus \n25.0 l/hr). A mass balance study showed that approximately 57 % of radiolabelled olanzapine \nappeared in urine, principally as metabolites. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA small study of the effect of impaired liver function in 6 subjects with clinically significant (Childs \nPugh Classification A (n = 5) and B (n = 1)) cirrhosis revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of \n\n\n\n 16 \n\norally administered olanzapine (2.5 \u2013 7.5 mg single dose): Subjects with mild to moderate hepatic \ndysfunction had slightly increased systemic clearance and faster elimination half-time compared to \nsubjects with no hepatic dysfunction (n = 3). There were more smokers among subjects with cirrhosis \n(4/6; 67 %) than among subjects with no hepatic dysfunction (0/3; 0 %). \n \nSmoking \nIn non-smoking versus smoking subjects (males and females) the mean elimination half-life was \nprolonged (38.6 versus 30.4 hr) and the clearance was reduced (18.6 versus 27.7 l/hr). \n \nThe plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects, in females versus males, \nand in non-smokers versus smokers. However, the magnitude of the impact of age, gender, or smoking \non olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between \nindividuals.  \n \nIn a study of Caucasians, Japanese, and Chinese subjects, there were no differences in the \npharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations. \n \nPaediatric population \nAdolescents (ages 13 to 17 years): The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between \nadolescents and adults. In clinical studies, the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27% \nhigher in adolescents. Demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower \naverage body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers. Such factors possibly contribute to the \nhigher average exposure observed in adolescents. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAcute (single-dose) toxicity \nSigns of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds: hypoactivity, \ncoma, tremors, clonic convulsions, salivation, and depressed weight gain. The median lethal doses \nwere approximately 210 mg/kg (mice) and 175 mg/kg (rats). Dogs tolerated single oral doses up to \n100 mg/kg without mortality. Clinical signs included sedation, ataxia, tremors, increased heart rate, \nlabored respiration, miosis, and anorexia. In monkeys, single oral doses up to 100 mg/kg resulted in \nprostration and, at higher doses, semi-consciousness. \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity  \nIn studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs, the predominant effects \nwere CNS depression, anticholinergic effects, and peripheral haematological disorders. Tolerance \ndeveloped to the CNS depression. Growth parameters were decreased at high doses. Reversible effects \nconsistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and \nmorphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland. \n \nHaematologic toxicity: Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species, including \ndose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating \nleukocytes in rats; however, no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found. Reversible \nneutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anaemia developed in a few dogs treated with 8 or 10 mg/kg/day \n(total olanzapine exposure [area under the curve] is 12- to 15-fold greater than that of a man given a \n12-mg dose). In cytopenic dogs, there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in \nthe bone marrow.  \n \nReproductive toxicity \nOlanzapine had no teratogenic effects. Sedation affected mating performance of male rats. Estrous \ncycles were affected at doses of 1.1 mg/kg (3 times the maximum human dose) and reproduction \nparameters were influenced in rats given 3 mg/kg (9 times the maximum human dose). In the offspring \nof rats given olanzapine, delays in foetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity \nlevels were seen. \n \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nMutagenicity \nOlanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests, which included bacterial \nmutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests. \n \nCarcinogenicity \nBased on the results of studies in mice and rats, it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic. \n \n \n6.

uncommon side effect that may affect up to 1 in 100 people) especially in the legs (symptoms include swelling, pain, and redness in the leg), which may travel through blood vessels to the lungs causing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. if you notice any of these symptoms seek medical advice immediately; a combination of fever, faster breathing, sweating, muscle stiffness and drowsiness or sleepiness (the frequency of this side effect cannot be estimated from the available data). very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) include weight gain; sleepiness; and increases in levels of prolactin in the blood. in the early stages of treatment, some people may feel dizzy or faint (with a slow heart rate), especially when getting up from a lying or sitting position. this will usually pass on its own but if it does not, tell your doctor. common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) include changes in the levels of some blood cells, circulating fats and early in treatment, temporary increases in liver enzymes ; increases in the level of sugars in the blood and urine; increases in levels of uric acid and creatine phosphokinase in the blood; feeling more hungry; dizziness; restlessness; tremor; unusual movements (dyskinesias); constipation; dry mouth; rash; loss of strength; extreme tiredness; water retention leading to swelling of the

people) include hypersensitivity (e.g. swelling in the mouth and throat, itching, rash); diabetes or the worsening of diabetes, occasionally associated with ketoacidosis (ketones in the blood and urine) or coma; seizures, usually associated with a history of seizures (epilepsy); muscle stiffness or spasms ( including eye movements); restless legs syndrome; problems with speech; stuttering; slow heart rate; sensitivity to sunlight; bleeding from the nose; abdominal distension; drooling; memory loss or forgetfulness; urinary incontinence; lack of ability to urinate; hair loss; absence or

include lowering of normal body temperature; abnormal rhythms of the heart; sudden unexplained death; inflammation of the pancreas causing severe stomach pain, fever and sickness; liver disease appearing as yellowing of the skin and white parts of the eyes; muscle disease presenting as unexplained aches and pains; and prolonged and/or painful erection. very rare side effects include serious allergic reactions such as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (dress). dress appears initially as flu-like symptoms with a rash on the face and then with an extended rash, high temperature, enlarged lymph nodes, increased levels of liver enzymes seen on blood tests and an increase in a type of white blood cells (eosinophilia). while taking olanzapine, elderly patients with dementia may suffer from stroke, pneumonia, urinary incontinence, falls, extreme tiredness, visual hallucinations, a rise in body temperature, redness of the skin and have trouble walking. some fatal cases have been reported in this particular group of patients. in patients with parkinson's disease zyprexa velotab may worsen the symptoms. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk
