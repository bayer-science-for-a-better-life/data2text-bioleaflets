NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNevirapine Teva 200 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 200 mg of nevirapine (as anhydrous). \n \nExcipient with known effect: Each tablet contains 168 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet \n \nWhite, oval, biconvex tablets. One side is debossed with \"N\", a scoreline and \"200\". The opposite side \nis debossed with a scoreline. The score line is only to facilitate breaking for ease of swallowing and \nnot to divide into equal doses. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNevirapine Teva is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the \ntreatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age (see section 4.2). \n \nMost of the experience with nevirapine is in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NRTIs). The choice of a subsequent therapy after nevirapine should be based on clinical \nexperience and resistance testing (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNevirapine Teva should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the  treatment of HIV \ninfection.  \n \nPosology \n \nPatients 16 years and older \nThe recommended dose of Nevirapine Teva is one 200 mg tablet daily for the first 14 days (this lead-\nin period should be used because it has been found to lessen the frequency of rash), followed by one \n200 mg tablet twice daily, in combination with at least two additional antiretroviral agents. \n \nFor patients who are unable to swallow tablets or who weigh less than 50 kg or whose body surface \narea is below 1.25 m2 according to the Mosteller formula, other nevirapine containing oral \nformulations are available and should be used if appropriate. \n \nIf a dose is recognized as missed within 8 hours of when it was due, the patient should take the missed \ndose as soon as possible. If a dose is missed and it is more than 8 hours later, the patient should only \ntake the next dose at the usual time. \n \nDose management considerations \nPatients experiencing rash during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day should not have their \nNevirapine Teva dose increased until the rash has resolved. The isolated rash should be closely \n\n\n\n3 \n\nmonitored (see section 4.4). The 200 mg once daily dosing regimen should not be continued beyond \n28 days at which point in time an alternative treatment should be sought due to the possible risk of \nunderexposure and resistance. \n \nPatients who interrupt nevirapine dosing for more than 7 days should restart the recommended dosing \nregimen using the two week lead-in period. \n \nThere are toxicities that require interruption of Nevirapine Teva therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65. \n \nRenal impairment \nFor patients with renal dysfunction requiring dialysis an additional 200 mg dose of nevirapine \nfollowing each dialysis treatment is recommended. Patients with CLcr \u2265 20 ml/min do not require a \ndose adjustment, see section 5.2. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNevirapine should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, see section \n4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n  \nPaediatric population \nNevirapine Teva 200 mg tablets, following the dosing schedule described above, are suitable for larger \nchildren, particularly adolescents, below the age of 16 who weigh more than 50 kg or whose body \nsurface area is above 1.25 m2 according to the Mosteller formula. \n \nMethod of administration \nThe tablets shall be taken with liquid, and should not be crushed or chewed. Nevirapine Teva may be \ntaken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nReadministration to patients who have required permanent discontinuation for severe rash, rash \naccompanied by constitutional symptoms, hypersensitivity reactions, or clinical hepatitis due to \nnevirapine. \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) or pre-treatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN \nuntil baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN. \n \nReadministration to patients who previously had ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN during nevirapine therapy \nand had recurrence of liver function abnormalities upon readministration of nevirapine (see section \n4.4). \n \nCoadministration with herbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to \nthe risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of nevirapine (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNevirapine Teva should only be used with at least two other antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1). \n \nNevirapine Teva should not be used as the sole active antiretroviral, as monotherapy with any \n\nantiretroviral has shown to result in viral resistance. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nThe first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring of patients to disclose the potential appearance of severe and life-threatening skin \nreactions (including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN)) and serious hepatitis/hepatic failure. The greatest risk of hepatic and skin reactions \noccurs in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However, the risk of any hepatic event continues past this \nperiod and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals. Female gender and higher CD4 \ncounts (>250/mm3 in adult females and >400/mm3 in adult males) at the initiation of nevirapine \ntherapy are associated with a greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions if the patient has \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA - i.e. a concentration \u2265 50 copies/ml - at the initiation of \nnevirapine. As serious and life threatening hepatotoxicity has been observed in controlled and \nuncontrolled studies predominantly in patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or \nhigher, nevirapine should not be initiated in adult females with CD4 cell counts greater than \n250 cells/mm3 or in adult males with CD4 cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm3, who have a \ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA unless the benefit outweighs the risk. \nIn some cases, hepatic injury has progressed despite discontinuation of treatment. Patients \ndeveloping signs or symptoms of hepatitis, severe skin reaction or hypersensitivity reactions \nmust discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately. Nevirapine must not be \nrestarted following severe hepatic, skin or hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.3). \n \nThe dose must be strictly adhered to, especially the 14-days lead-in period (see section 4.2). \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with \nnevirapine mainly during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions characterised by rash, \nconstitutional findings and visceral involvement. Patients should be intensively monitored during the \nfirst 18 weeks of treatment. Patients should be closely monitored if an isolated rash occurs. Nevirapine \nmust be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by \nconstitutional symptoms (such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle \nor joint aches, or general malaise), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis. Nevirapine must be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing hypersensitivity \nreaction (characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms, plus visceral involvement, such as \nhepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction), see section 4.4. \n \nNevirapine Teva administration above the recommended dose might increase the frequency and \nseriousness of skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.  \n \nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nnevirapine use.  \n \nConcomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) has been \nshown not to decrease the incidence of nevirapine-associated rash, and may be associated with an \nincrease in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy.  \n \nSome risk factors for developing serious cutaneous reactions have been identified; they include failure \nto follow the initial dosing of 200 mg daily during the lead-in period and a long delay between the \ninitial symptoms and medical consultation. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing \nrash, whether receiving nevirapine or non- nevirapine containing therapy.  \n \nPatients should be instructed that a major toxicity of nevirapine is rash. They should be advised to \npromptly notify their physician of any rash and avoid delay between the initial symptoms and medical \nconsultation. The majority of rashes associated with nevirapine occur within the first 6 weeks of \ninitiation of therapy. Therefore, patients should be monitored carefully for the appearance of rash \nduring this period. Patients should be instructed that dose escalation is not to occur if any rash occurs \n\n\n\n5 \n\nduring the two-week lead-in dosing period, until the rash resolves. The 200 mg once daily dosing \nregimen should not be continued beyond 28 days at which point in time an alternative treatment \nshould be sought due to the possible risk of underexposure and resistance. \n \nAny patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, \nblistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise should \ndiscontinue the medicinal product and immediately seek medical evaluation. In these patients \nnevirapine must not be restarted.  \n \nIf patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, liver function tests should be \nperformed. Patients with moderate to severe elevations (ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN) should be \npermanently discontinued from nevirapine.  \n \nIf a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, \narthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, \ngranulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction, nevirapine must be permanently stopped and not be \nreintroduced (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatic reactions \n \nSevere and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis, has occurred in patients \ntreated with nevirapine. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring. The risk of hepatic reactions is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However the risk \ncontinues past this period and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals throughout treatment. \n \nRhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with \nnevirapine use. \n \nIncreased ASAT or ALAT levels \u2265 2.5 ULN and/or co-infection with hepatitis B and/or C at the start \nof antiretroviral therapy is associated with greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions during \nantiretroviral therapy in general, including nevirapine containing regimens. \n \nFemale gender and higher CD4 counts at the initiation of nevirapine therapy in treatment-na\u00efve \npatients is associated with increased risk of hepatic adverse reactions. Women have a three fold higher \nrisk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (5.8 % versus 2.2 %), and \ntreatment-na\u00efve patients of either gender with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma with higher CD4 \ncounts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with \nnevirapine. In a retrospective review of predominantly patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 \ncopies/ml or higher, women with CD4 counts > 250 cells/mm3 had a 12 fold higher risk of \nsymptomatic hepatic adverse reactions compared to women with CD4 counts < 250 cells/mm3 (11.0 % \nversus 0.9 %). An increased risk was observed in men with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma and CD4 \ncounts > 400 cells/mm3 (6.3 % versus 1.2 % for men with CD4 counts < 400 cells/mm3). This \nincreased risk for toxicity based on CD4 count thresholds has not been detected in patients with \nundetectable (i.e. < 50 copies/ml) plasma viral load. \n \nPatients should be informed that hepatic reactions are a major toxicity of nevirapine requiring close \nmonitoring during the first 18 weeks. They should be informed that occurrence of symptoms \nsuggestive of hepatitis should lead them to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical \nevaluation, which should include liver function tests. \n \nLiver monitoring \n \nClinical chemistry tests, which include liver function tests, should be performed prior to initiating \nnevirapine therapy and at appropriate intervals during therapy. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nAbnormal liver function tests have been reported with nevirapine, some in the first few weeks of \ntherapy.  \n \nAsymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes are frequently described and are not necessarily a \ncontraindication to use nevirapine. Asymptomatic GGT elevations are not a contraindication to \ncontinue therapy. \n \nMonitoring of hepatic tests should be done every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, at \nthe 3rd month and then regularly thereafter. Liver test monitoring should be performed if the patient \nexperiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity. \n \nIf ASAT or ALAT \u2265 2.5 ULN before or during treatment, then liver tests should be monitored more \nfrequently during regular clinic visits. Nevirapine must not be administered to patients with pre-\ntreatment ASAT or ALAT > 5 ULN until baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised < 5 ULN (see section \n4.3). \n \nPhysicians and patients should be vigilant for prodromal signs or findings of hepatitis, such as \nanorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, hepatomegaly or liver tenderness. Patients \nshould be instructed to seek medical attention promptly if these occur.  \n \nIf ASAT or ALAT increase to > 5 ULN during treatment, nevirapine should be immediately \nstopped. If ASAT and ALAT return to baseline values and if the patient had no clinical signs or \nsymptoms of hepatitis, rash, constitutional symptoms or other findings suggestive of organ \ndysfunction, it may be possible to reintroduce nevirapine, on a case by case basis, at the starting \ndose regimen of 200 mg/day for 14 days followed by 400 mg/day. In these cases, more frequent \nliver monitoring is required. If liver function abnormalities recur, nevirapine should be \npermanently discontinued. \n \nIf clinical hepatitis occurs, characterised by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, icterus AND laboratory \nfindings (such as moderate or severe liver function test abnormalities (excluding GGT)), \nnevirapine must be permanently stopped. Nevirapine must not be readministered to patients \nwho have required permanent discontinuation for clinical hepatitis due to nevirapine. \n \nLiver disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of nevirapine has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Nevirapine is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nC, see section 4.3). Pharmacokinetic results suggest caution should be exercised when nevirapine is \nadministered to patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B). Patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe \nand potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In the case of concomitant antiviral therapy for \nhepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nOther warnings \n \nPost-Exposure-Prophylaxis: Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure requiring transplantation, \nhas been reported in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting \nof post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. The use of nevirapine has not been evaluated \nwithin a specific study on PEP, especially in term of treatment duration and therefore, is strongly \ndiscouraged. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nCombination therapy with nevirapine is not a curative treatment of patients infected with HIV-1; \npatients may continue to experience illnesses associated with advanced HIV-1 infection, including \nopportunistic infections. \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nHormonal methods of birth control other than Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) should \nnot be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking Nevirapine Teva, since nevirapine \nmight lower the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. For this reason, and to reduce the \nrisk of HIV transmission, barrier contraception (e.g., condoms) is recommended. Additionally, when \npostmenopausal hormone therapy is used during administration of nevirapine, its therapeutic effect \nshould be monitored. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters: \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nIn clinical studies, nevirapine has been associated with an increase in HDL- cholesterol and an overall \nimprovement in the total to HDL-cholesterol ratio. However, in the absence of specific studies, the \nclinical impact of these findings is not known. In addition, nevirapine has not been shown to cause \nglucose disturbances. \n \nOsteonecrosis: Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis \nhave been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they \nexperience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to \nasymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or \naggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or \nmonths of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or \nfocal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms \nshould be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 \ndisease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune \nreactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many \nmonths after initiation of treatment. \n \nThe available pharmacokinetic data suggest that the concomitant use of rifampicin and nevirapine is \nnot recommended. Furthermore, combining the following compounds with Nevirapine Teva is not \nrecommended: efavirenz, ketoconazole, delavirdine, etravirine, rilpivirine, elvitegravir (in \ncombination with cobicistat), atazanavir (in combination with ritonavir), boceprevir; fosamprenavir (if \nnot co-administered with low dose ritonavir) (see section 4.5). \n \nGranulocytopenia is commonly associated with zidovudine. Therefore, patients who receive \nnevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly and especially paediatric patients and patients who receive \nhigher zidovudine doses or patients with poor bone marrow reserve, in particular those with advanced \nHIV disease, have an increased risk of granulocytopenia. In such patients haematological parameters \nshould be carefully monitored. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nLactose: Nevirapine Teva tablets contain 336 mg of lactose per maximum recommended daily dose. \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance e.g. galactosaemia, the Lapp lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNevirapine is an inducer of CYP3A and potentially CYP2B6, with maximal induction occurring \nwithin 2-4 weeks of initiating multiple-dose therapy. \n \nCompounds using this metabolic pathway may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-\nadministered with nevirapine. Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness of P450 metabolised \nmedicinal products is recommended when taken in combination with nevirapine. \n \nThe absorption of nevirapine is not affected by food, antacids or medicinal products which are \nformulated with an alkaline buffering agent. \n \nThe interaction data is presented as geometric mean value with 90% confidence interval (90% CI) \nwhenever these data were available.

No clinically \nrelevant drug-drug interaction is \nexpected. \n \n\nAdefovir and Nevirapine Teva \nmay be co-administered without \ndose adjustments. \n\nBoceprevir Boceprevir is partly metabolized by \nCYP3A4/5. Co-administration of \nboceprevir with medicines that \ninduce or inhibit CYP3A4/5 could \nincrease or decrease exposure.  \nPlasma trough concentrations of \nboceprevir were decreased when \nadministered with an NNRTI with a \nsimilar metabolic pathway as \nnevirapine. The clinical outcome of \nthis observed reduction of boceprevir \ntrough concentrations has not been \ndirectly assessed.  \n \n\nIt is not recommended to co-\nadminister boceprevir and \nNevirapine Teva (see section 4.4). \n\nEntecavir Entecavir is not a substrate, inducer \nor an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 \n(CYP450) enzymes.

Other enzymes may be \ninvolved in the metabolism. Co-\nadministration of telaprevir and \nmedicinal products that induce \nCYP3A and/or P-gp may decrease \ntelaprevir plasma concentrations. No \ndrug-drug interaction study of \ntelaprevir with nevirapine has been \nconducted, however, interaction \nstudies of telaprevir with an NNRTI \nwith a similar metabolic pathway as \nnevirapine demonstrated reduced \nlevels of both. Results of DDI \nstudies of telaprevir with efavirenz \nindicate that caution should be \nexercised when co-administering \ntelaprevir with P450 inducers.  \n\nCaution should be exercised when \nco-administering telaprevir with \nnevirapine.  \nIf co-administered with \nNevirapine Teva, an adjustment in \nthe telaprevir dose should be \nconsidered. \n \n\nTelbivudine Telbivudine is not a substrate, \ninducer or inhibitor of the \ncytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme \nsystem. Due to the metabolic \npathway of telbivudine, no clinically \nrelevant drug-drug interaction is \nexpected. \n \n\nTelbivudine and Nevirapine Teva \nmay be co-administered without \ndose adjustments. \n\nANTACIDS \nCimetidine \n \n\nCimetidine: no significant effect on \ncimetidine PK parameters is seen. \n \nNevirapine Cmin \u2191 1.07 \n \n\nCimetidine and Nevirapine Teva \ncan be co-administered without \ndose adjustments. \n \n\nANTITHROMBOTICS \nWarfarin \n \n\nThe interaction between nevirapine \nand the antithrombotic agent \nwarfarin is complex, with the \npotential for both increases and \ndecreases in coagulation time when \nused concomitantly. \n \n\nClose monitoring of \nanticoagulation levels is \nwarranted. \n \n\nCONTRACEPTIVES \n\n\n\n15 \n\nDepot-\nmedroxyprogesterone \nacetate (DMPA) \n150 mg every 3 \nmonths \n \n\nDMPA AUC \u2194 \nDMPA Cmin \u2194 \nDMPA Cmax \u2194 \n \nNevirapine AUC \u2191 1.20 \nNevirapine Cmax \u2191 1.20 \n \n\nNevirapine co-administration did \nnot alter the ovulation suppression \neffects of DMPA.

This is due \nto induction of medicinal product \nmetabolism enzymes and/or transport \nproteins by St. John\u2019s Wort. \n \n\nHerbal preparations containing St. \nJohn\u2018s Wort and Nevirapine Teva \nmust not be co-administered (see \nsection 4.3). If a patient is already \ntaking St. John\u2018s Wort check \nnevirapine and if possible viral \nlevels and stop St John\u2018s Wort. \nNevirapine levels may increase on \nstopping St John\u2018s Wort. The dose \nof Nevirapine Teva may need \nadjusting. The inducing effect may \npersist for at least 2 weeks after \ncessation of treatment with St. \nJohn\u2018s Wort. \n \n\n \nOther information: \n \nNevirapine metabolites: Studies using human liver microsomes indicated that the formation of \nnevirapine hydroxylated metabolites was not affected by the presence of dapsone, rifabutin, \nrifampicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Ketoconazole and erythromycin significantly \ninhibited the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\n\n\n16 \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should not use oral contraceptives as the sole method for birth \ncontrol, since nevirapine might lower the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products (see \nsections 4.4 & 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \nCurrently available data on pregnant women indicate no malformative or foeto/ neonatal toxicity. To \ndate no other relevant epidemiological data are available. No observable teratogenicity was detected in \nreproductive studies performed in pregnant rats and rabbits (see section 5.3). There are no adequate \nand well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Caution should be exercised when prescribing \nnevirapine to pregnant women (see section 4.4). As hepatotoxicity is more frequent in women with \nCD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma (50 or more copies/ml), \nthese conditions should be taken in consideration on therapeutic decision (see section 4.4). There is \nnot enough evidence to substantiate that the absence of an increased risk for toxicity seen in pretreated \nwomen initiating nevirapine with an undetectable viral load (less than 50 copies/ml of HIV-1 in \nplasma) and CD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm3 also applies to pregnant women. All the \nrandomised studies addressing this issue specifically excluded pregnant women, and pregnant women \nwere under-represented in cohort studies as well as in meta-analyses. \n \nBreast-feeding \nNevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. \n \nIt is recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal \ntransmission of HIV and that mothers should discontinue breast-feeding if they are receiving \nnevirapine. \n \nFertility \nIn reproductive toxicology studies, evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere are no specific studies about the ability to drive vehicles and use machinery. \nHowever, patients should be advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as fatigue during \ntreatment with Nevirapine Teva. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or \noperating machinery. If patients experience fatigue they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such \nas driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions related to nevirapine therapy, across all clinical \nstudies, were rash, allergic reactions, hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests, nausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, headache and myalgia. \n \nThe postmarketing experience has shown that the most serious adverse reactions are Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis, serious hepatitis/hepatic failure, and drug reaction with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as \nfever, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, \neosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical \nperiod which requires close monitoring (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions which may be causally related to the administration of nevirapine \nhave been reported. The frequencies estimated are based on pooled clinical study data for adverse \nreactions considered related to nevirapine treatment. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nFrequency is defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to \n<1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon  granulocytopenia \nUncommon  anaemia \n \nImmune system disorders \nCommon  hypersensitivity (incl. anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria) \nUncommon  anaphylactic reaction \nRare   drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon  headache \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon   nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon  hepatitis (including severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity) (1.9%) \nUncommon  jaundice \nRare   hepatitis fulminant (which may be fatal) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common  rash (12.5 %) \nUncommon  Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (which may be fatal) \n\n(0.2 %), angioedema, urticaria \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon   arthralgia, myalgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon   pyrexia, fatigue \n \nInvestigations \nCommon  liver function tests abnormal (alanine aminotransferase increased; transaminases \n   increased; aspartate aminotransferase increased; gamma-glutamyltransferase \n   increased; hepatic enzyme increased; hypertransaminasaemia) \nUncommon  blood phosphorus decreased; blood pressure increased \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nIn study 1100.1090, from which the majority of related adverse events (n=28) were received, patients \non placebo had a higher incidence of events of granulocytopenia (3.3%) than patients on nevirapine \n(2.5%). \n \nAnaphylactic reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in \nrandomised, controlled clinical studies. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based on the total number of patients exposed to nevirapine in randomised controlled \nclinical studies (n= 2,718). \n \nDecreased blood phosphorus and increased blood pressure were observed in clinical studies with co-\nadministration of tenofovir/emtricitabine. \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nThe following adverse reactions have also been reported when nevirapine has been used in \ncombination with other anti-retroviral agents: pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy and \nthrombocytopaenia. These adverse reactions are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents \nand may be expected to occur when nevirapine is used in combination with other agents; however it is \nunlikely that these adverse reactions are due to nevirapine treatment. Hepatic-renal failure syndromes \nhave been reported rarely.  \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissues \n \nThe most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, with nevirapine attributable rash occurring in \n12.5 % of patients in combination regimens in controlled studies. \n \nRashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or \nwithout pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. Hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction, \nangioedema and urticaria) have been reported. Rashes occur alone or in the context of drug reaction \nwith eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as \nfever, arthralgia, myalgia and lympadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, \neosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. \n \nSevere and life-threatening skin reactions have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine, including \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Fatal cases of SJS, TEN and \ndrug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported. The majority of severe \nrashes occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment and some required hospitalisation, with one \npatient requiring surgical intervention (see section 4.4). \n \nHepato-biliary \n \nThe most frequently observed laboratory test abnormalities are elevations in liver function tests \n(LFTs), including ALAT, ASAT, GGT, total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Asymptomatic \nelevations of GGT levels are the most frequent. Cases of jaundice have been reported. Cases of \nhepatitis (severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis) have been \nreported in patients treated with nevirapine. The best predictor of a serious hepatic event was elevated \nbaseline liver function tests. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close \nmonitoring (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on clinical study experience of 361 paediatric patients the majority of which received \ncombination treatment with ZDV or/and ddI, the most frequently reported adverse events related to \nnevirapine were similar to those observed in adults. Granulocytopenia was more frequently observed \nin children. In an open-label clinical study (ACTG 180) granulocytopenia assessed as medicinal \nproduct-related occurred in 5/37 (13.5 %) of patients. In ACTG 245, a double-blind placebo controlled \nstudy, the frequency of serious medicinal product-related granulocytopenia was 5/305 (1.6 %). \nIsolated cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition \nsyndrome have been reported in this population. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote for nevirapine overdose. Cases of nevirapine overdose at doses ranging \nfrom 800 to 6,000 mg per day for up to 15 days have been reported. Patients have experienced \noedema, erythema nodosum, fatigue, fever, headache, insomnia, nausea, pulmonary infiltrates, rash, \nvertigo, vomiting, increase in transaminases and weight decrease. All of these effects subsided \nfollowing discontinuation of nevirapine. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOne case of massive accidental overdose in a newborn was reported. The ingested dose was 40 times \nthe recommended dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Mild isolated neutropenia and hyperlactataemia was observed, \nwhich spontaneously disappeared within one week without any clinical complications. One year later, \nthe child\u2019s development remained normal. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors, ATC code J05AG01. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nNevirapine is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Nevirapine is a non-competitive inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse \ntranscriptase, but it does not have a biologically significant inhibitory effect on the HIV-2 reverse \ntranscriptase or on eukaryotic DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, or \u03b4. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro  \n \nNevirapine had a median EC50 value (50% inhibitory concentration) of 63 nM against a panel of group \nM HIV-1 isolates from clades A, B, C, D, F, G, and H, and circulating recombinant forms (CRF), \nCRF01_AE, CRF02_AG and CRF12_BF replicating in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In a panel \nof 2,923 predominantly subtype B HIV-1 clinical isolates, the mean EC50 value was 90 nM. Similar \nEC50 values are obtained when the antiviral activity of nevirapine is measured in peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells, monocyte derived macrophages or lymphoblastoid cell line. Nevirapine had no \nantiviral activity in cell culture against group O HIV-1 isolates or HIV-2 isolates. \n \nNevirapine in combination with efavirenz exhibited a strong antagonistic anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro \n(see section 4.5) and was additive to antagonistic with the protease inhibitor ritonavir or the fusion \ninhibitor enfuvirtide. Nevirapine exhibited additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in combination \nwith the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir, and \nthe NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The \nanti-HIV-1 activity of nevirapine was antagonized by the anti-HBV medicinal product adefovir and by \nthe anti-HCV medicinal product ribavirin in vitro. \n \nResistance \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility (100-250-fold) to nevirapine emerge in cell culture. \nGenotypic analysis showed mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene Y181C and/or V106A depending upon \nthe virus strain and cell line employed. Time to emergence of nevirapine resistance in cell culture was \nnot altered when selection included nevirapine in combination with several other NNRTIs. \n \nGenotypic analysis of isolates from antiretroviral na\u00efve patients experiencing virologic failure (n=71) \nreceiving nevirapine once daily (n=25) or twice daily (n=46) in combination with lamivudine and \nstavudine for 48 weeks showed that isolates from 8/25 and 23/46 patients, respectively, contained one \nor more of the following NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions: \nY181C, K101E, G190A/S, K103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/L, A98G, F227L and M230L. \n \nCross-resistance \n \nRapid emergence of HIV-strains which are cross-resistant to NNRTIs has been observed in vitro. \nCross resistance to delavirdine and efavirenz is expected after virologic failure with nevirapine. \nDepending on resistance testing results, an etravirine-containing regimen may be used subsequently. \nCross-resistance between nevirapine and either HIV protease inhibitors, HIV integrase inhibitors or \nHIV entry inhibitors is unlikely because the enzyme targets involved are different. Similarly the \npotential for cross-resistance between nevirapine and NRTIs is low because the molecules have \ndifferent binding sites on the reverse transcriptase.  \n \nClinical results \n \nNevirapine has been evaluated in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients. \n \nStudies in treatment-na\u00efve patients \n \n2NN study \n \nThe double non-nucleoside study 2 NN was a randomised, open-label, multicentre prospective study \ncomparing the NNRTIs nevirapine, efavirenz and both medicinal products given together. \n \n1,216 antiretroviral-therapy na\u00efve patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA > 5,000 copies/ml at baseline \nwere assigned to nevirapine 400 mg once daily, nevirapine 200 mg twice daily, efavirenz 600 mg once \ndaily, or nevirapine (400 mg) and efavirenz (800 mg) once daily, plus stavudine and lamivudine for 48 \nweeks. \nThe primary endpoint, treatment failure, was defined as less than 1 log10 decline in plasma HIV-1 \nRNA in the first 12 weeks, or two consecutive measurements of more than 50 copies/ ml from week \n24 onwards, or disease progression. \n \nMedian age was 34 years and about 64% were male patients, median CD4 cell count was 170 and \n190 cells per mm3 in the nevirapine twice daily and efavirenz groups, respectively. There were no \nsignificant differences in demographic and baseline characteristics between the treatment groups. \n \nThe predetermined primary efficacy comparison was between the nevirapine twice daily and the \nefavirenz treatment groups.  \n \nThe nevirapine twice daily regimen and the efavirenz regimen were not significantly different (p= \n0.091) in terms of efficacy as measured by treatment failure, or any component of treatment failure \nincluding virological failure. \n \nThe simultaneous use of nevirapine (400 mg) plus efavirenz (800 mg) was associated with the highest \nfrequency of clinical adverse events and with the highest rate of treatment failure (53.1%). As the \nregimen of nevirapine plus efavirenz did not have additional efficacy and caused more adverse events \nthan each medicinal product separately, this regimen is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTwenty per cent of patients assigned to nevirapine twice daily and 18% of patients assigned to \nefavirenz had at least one grade 3 or 4 clinical adverse event. Clinical hepatitis reported as clinical \nadverse event occurred in 10 (2.6%) and 2 (0.5%) patients in the nevirapine twice daily and efavirenz \ngroups respectively. The proportion of patients with at least one grade 3 or 4 liver-associated \nlaboratory toxicity was 8.3% for nevirapine twice daily and 4.5% for efavirenz. Of the patients with \ngrade 3 or 4 liver-associated laboratory toxicity, the proportions coinfected with hepatitis B or \nhepatitis C virus were 6.7% and 20.0% in the nevirapine twice daily group, 5.6% and 11.1% in the \nefavirenz group. \n \n2NN Three-year follow-up-study \n \nThis is a retrospective multicentre study comparing the 3-year antiviral efficacy of nevirapine and \nefavirenz in combination with stavudine and lamivudine in 2NN patients from week 49 to week 144. \nPatients who participated in the 2NN study and were still under active follow-up at week 48 when the \nstudy closed and were still being treated at the study clinic, were asked to participate in this study. \nPrimary study endpoints (percentage of patients with treatment failures) and secondary study \nendpoints as well as backbone therapy were similar to the original 2NN study. \n \nA durable response to nevirapine for at least three years was documented in this study, and \nequivalence within a 10% range was demonstrated between nevirapine 200 mg twice daily and \nefavirenz with respect to treatment failure. Both, the primary (p = 0.92) and secondary endpoints \nshowed no statistically significant differences between efavirenz and nevirapine 200 mg twice daily. \n \nStudies in treatment-experienced patients \n \nNEFA study \n \nThe NEFA study is a controlled prospective randomised study which evaluated treatment options for \npatients who switch from protease inhibitor (PI) based regimen with undetectable load to either \nnevirapine, efavirenz or abacavir. \nThe study randomly assigned 460 adults who were taking two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase \ninhibitors and at least one PI and whose plasma HIV-1 RNA levels had been less than 200 c/ml for at \nleast the previous six months to switch from the PI to nevirapine (155 patients), efavirenz (156), or \nabacavir (149). \nThe primary study endpoint was death, progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or an \nincrease in HIV-1 RNA levels to 200 copies or more per millilitre.  \n \nAt 12 months, the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates of the likelihood of reaching the endpoint were 10 % in the \nnevirapine group, 6 % in the efavirenz group, and 13 percent in the abacavir group (P=0.10 according \nto an intention-to-treat analysis). \n \nThe overall incidence of adverse events was significantly lower (61 patients, or 41%) in the abacavir \ngroup than in the nevirapine group (83 patients, or 54%) or the efavirenz group (89 patients, or 57%). \nSignificantly fewer patients in the abacavir group (9 patients, or 6%) than in the nevirapine group (26 \npatients, or 17%) or the efavirenz group (27 patients, or 17%) discontinued the medicinal product \nbecause of adverse events. \n \nPerinatal Transmission \n \nNumerous studies have been performed examining the use of nevirapine in regards to perinatal \ntransmission, most notably HIVNET 012. This study demonstrated a significant reduction in \ntransmission using single dose nevirapine (13.1 % (n = 310) in the nevirapine group, versus 25.1 % (n \n= 308) in the ultra-short zidovudine group (p = 0.00063)). Monotherapy with nevirapine has been \nassociated with the development of NNRTI resistance. Single dose nevirapine in mothers or infants \nmay lead to reduced efficacy if an HIV treatment regimen using nevirapine is later instituted within 6 \nmonths or less in these patients. Combination of other antiretrovirals with single-dose nevirapine \n\n\n\n22 \n\nattenuates the emergence of nevirapine resistance. Where other antiretroviral medicines are accessible, \nthe single dose nevirapine regimen should be combined with additional effective antiretroviral \nmedicines (as recommended in internationally recognized guidelines).    \n \nThe clinical relevance of these data in European populations has not been established. Furthermore, in \nthe case nevirapine is used as single dose to prevent vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection, the risk \nof hepatotoxicity in mother and child cannot be excluded. \n \nPaediatric population \nResults of a 48-week analysis of the South African study BI 1100.1368 confirmed that the 4/7 mg/kg \nand 150 mg/m2 nevirapine dose groups were well tolerated and effective in treating antiretroviral naive \npaediatric patients. A marked improvement in the CD4+ cell percent was observed through Week 48 \nfor both dose groups. Also, both dosing regimens were effective in reducing the viral load. In this 48-\nweek study no unexpected safety findings were observed in either dosing group. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption: Nevirapine is readily absorbed (> 90 %) after oral administration in healthy volunteers \nand in adults with HIV-1 infection. Absolute bioavailability in 12 healthy adults following single-dose \nadministration was 93 \u00b1 9% (mean SD) for a 50 mg tablet and 91 \u00b1 8 % for an oral solution. Peak \nplasma nevirapine concentrations of 2 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcg/ml (7.5 \u03bcM) were attained by 4 hours following a \nsingle 200 mg dose. Following multiple doses, nevirapine peak concentrations appear to increase \nlinearly in the dose range of 200 to 400 mg/day. Data reported in the literature from 20 HIV-infected \npatients suggest a steady state Cmax of 5.74 \u03bcg/ml (5.00-7.44) and Cmin of 3.73 \u03bcg/ml (3.20-5.08) with \nan AUC of 109.0 h*\u03bcg/ml (96.0-143.5) in patients taking 200 mg of nevirapine bid. Other published \ndata support these conclusions. Long-term efficacy appears to be most likely in patients whose \nnevirapine trough levels exceed 3.5 \u03bcg/ml. \n \nDistribution: Nevirapine is lipophilic and is essentially nonionized at physiologic pH. Following \nintravenous administration to healthy adults, the volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was \n1.21 \u00b1 0.09 l/kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily \ncrosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. Nevirapine is about 60 % bound to plasma proteins in \nthe plasma concentration range of 1-10 \u03bcg/ml. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid \n(n = 6) were 45 % (\u00b1 5 %) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the \nfraction not bound to plasma protein. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination: In vivo studies in humans and in vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 \n(oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. In vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome \nP450 isozymes from the CYP3A family, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a \nmass balance/excretion study in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine \n200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of 14C-nevirapine, approximately \n91.4 \u00b1 10.5 % of the radiolabelled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 \u00b1 11.1 %) representing the \nprimary route of excretion compared to faeces (10.1 \u00b1 1.5%). Greater than 80 % of the radioactivity in \nurine was made up of glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. Thus cytochrome P450 \nmetabolism, glucuronide conjugation, and urinary excretion of glucuronidated metabolites represent \nthe primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction \n(< 5 %) of the radioactivity in urine (representing < 3 % of the total dose) was made up of parent \ncompound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound. \n \nNevirapine has been shown to be an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes. The \npharmacokinetics of autoinduction is characterised by an approximately 1.5 to 2 fold increase in the \napparent oral clearance of nevirapine as treatment continues from a single dose to two-to-four weeks \nof dosing with 200-400 mg/day. Autoinduction also results in a corresponding decrease in the terminal \n\n\n\n23 \n\nphase half-life of nevirapine in plasma from approximately 45 hours (single dose) to approximately \n25-30 hours following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day. \n \nSpecial populations: \nRenal dysfunction: The single-dose pharmacokinetics of nevirapine has been compared in 23 patients \nwith either mild (50 \u2264 CLcr < 80 ml/min), moderate (30 \u2264 CLcr < 50 ml/min) or severe renal \ndysfunction (CLcr < 30 ml/min), renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \ndialysis, and 8 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 ml/min). Renal impairment (mild, \nmoderate and severe) resulted in no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. \nHowever, patients with ESRD requiring dialysis exhibited a 43.5 % reduction in nevirapine AUC over \na one-week exposure period. There was also accumulation of nevirapine hydroxy-metabolites in \nplasma. The results suggest that supplementing nevirapine therapy with an additional 200 mg dose of \nnevirapine following each dialysis treatment would help offset the effects of dialysis on nevirapine \nclearance. Otherwise patients with CLcr \u2265 20 ml/min do not require an adjustment in nevirapine \ndosing. \n \nHepatic dysfunction: A steady state study comparing 46 patients with  \nmild (n=17: Ishak Score 1-2), \nmoderate (n=20; Ishak Score 3-4), \nor severe (n=9; Ishak Score 5-6, Child-Pugh A in 8 pts., for 1 Child-Pugh score not applicable) liver \nfibrosis as a measure of hepatic impairment was conducted.  \n \nThe patients studied were receiving antiretroviral therapy containing nevirapine 200 mg twice daily \nfor at least 6 weeks prior to pharmacokinetic sampling, with a median duration of therapy of 3.4 years. \nIn this study, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of nevirapine and the five oxidative \nmetabolites were not altered. \n \nHowever, approximately 15 % of these patients with hepatic fibrosis had nevirapine trough \nconcentrations above 9,000 ng/ml (2 fold the usual mean trough). Patients with hepatic impairment \nshould be monitored carefully for evidence of medicinal product induced toxicity. \n \nIn a 200 mg nevirapine single dose pharmacokinetic study of HIV-negative patients with mild and \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, n=6; Child-Pugh B, n=4), a significant increase in the \nAUC of nevirapine was observed in one Child-Pugh B patient with ascites suggesting that patients \nwith worsening hepatic function and ascites may be at risk of accumulating nevirapine in the systemic \ncirculation. Because nevirapine induces its own metabolism with multiple dosing, this single dose \nstudy may not reflect the impact of hepatic impairment on multiple dose pharmacokinetics (see section \n4.4). \n \nGender and older people \nIn the multinational 2NN study, a population pharmacokinetic substudy of 1,077 patients was \nperformed that included 391 females. Female patients showed a 13.8 % lower clearance of nevirapine \nthan did male patients. This difference is not considered clinically relevant. Since neither body weight \nnor Body Mass Index (BMI) had influence on the clearance of nevirapine, the effect of gender cannot \nbe explained by body size. Nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 infected adults does not appear to \nchange with age (range 19-68 years) or race (Black, Hispanic, or Caucasian).  \nNevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65. \n \nPaediatric population \nData concerning the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine have been derived from two major sources: a 48 \nweek paediatric study in South Africa (BI 1100.1368) involving 123 HIV-1 positive, antiretroviral \nna\u00efve patients aged 3 months to 16 years; and a consolidated analysis of five Paediatric AIDS Clinical \nTrials Group (PACTG) protocols comprising 495 patients aged 14 days to 19 years. \n \nPharmacokinetic data on 33 patients (age range 0.77 \u2013 13.7 years) in the intensive sampling group \ndemonstrated that clearance of nevirapine increased with increasing age in a manner consistent with \n\n\n\n24 \n\nincreasing body surface area. Dosing of nevirapine at 150 mg/m2 BID (after a two-week lead in at \n150 mg/m2 QD) produced geometric mean or mean trough nevirapine concentrations between \n4-6 \u03bcg/ml (as targeted from adult data). In addition, the observed trough nevirapine concentrations \nwere comparable between the two methods. \n \nThe consolidated analysis of Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols 245, 356, 366, \n377, and 403 allowed for the evaluation of paediatric patients less than 3 months of age (n=17) \nenrolled in these PACTG studies. The plasma nevirapine concentrations observed were within the \nrange observed in adults and the remainder of the paediatric population, but were more variable \nbetween patients, particularly in the second month of age. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans other than those observed in clinical studies \nbased on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. In \ncarcinogenicity studies, nevirapine induces hepatic tumours in rats and mice. These findings are most \nlikely related to nevirapine being a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and not due to a genotoxic mode \nof action. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n  \n\n\n\n35 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\n Nevirapine Teva 200 mg tablets  \nnevirapine \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What Nevirapine Teva is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Nevirapine Teva \n3. How to take Nevirapine Teva \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Nevirapine Teva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Nevirapine Teva is and what it is used for \n \nNevirapine Teva belongs to a group of medicines called antiretrovirals, used in the treatment of \nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection. \n \nThe active substance of your medicine is called nevirapine. Nevirapine belongs to a class of anti-HIV \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Reverse transcriptase is an \nenzyme that HIV needs in order to multiply. Nevirapine stops reverse transcriptase from working. By \nstopping reverse transcriptase from working, Nevirapine Teva helps control HIV-1 infection. \n \nNevirapine Teva is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of \nany age. You must take Nevirapine Teva together with other antiretroviral medicines. Your doctor will \nrecommend the best medicines for you. \n \nIf Nevirapine Teva has been prescribed for your child, please note that all information in this \nleaflet is addressed to your child (in this case please read \u201cyour child\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Nevirapine Teva \n \nDo not take Nevirapine Teva \n- if you are allergic to nevirapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n- if you have taken Nevirapine Teva before and had to stop the treatment because you suffered \n\nfrom: \n -  severe skin rash \n - skin rash with other symptoms for example: \n  - fever \n  - blistering \n  - mouth sores \n  - inflammation of the eye \n  - swelling of the face \n  - general swelling \n  - shortness of breath \n\n\n\n36 \n\n  - muscle or joint pain \n  - general feelings of illness \n  - abdominal pain \n - hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions \n - inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) \n- if you have severe liver disease \n- if you have had to stop nevirapine treatment in the past because of changes in your liver \n\nfunction   \n- if you are taking a medicine containing the herbal substance St John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum \n\nperforatum). This herbal substance may stop Nevirapine Teva from working properly. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Nevirapine Teva \nDuring the first 18 weeks of treatment with Nevirapine Teva it is very important that you and \nyour doctor watch out for signs of liver or skin reactions. These can become severe and even life \nthreatening. You are at greatest risk of such a reaction during the first 6 weeks of treatment. \n \nI f you exper ience severe rash or  hypersensitivity (allergic reactions that may appear  in the form \nof rash) accompanied by other  side effects such as \n- fever ,  \n- blister ing,  \n- mouth sores,  \n- inflammation of the eye,  \n- swelling of the face,  \n- general swelling,  \n- shor tness of breath,  \n- muscle or  joint pain,  \n- general feelings of illness,  \n- or  abdominal pain  \nYOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE TAKING NEVIRAPINE TEVA AND YOU MUST CONTACT \nyour  doctor  IMMEDIATELY as such reactions can be potentially life-threatening or  lead to \ndeath. I f you ever  have only mild rash symptoms without any other  reaction please inform your  \ndoctor immediately, who will advise you whether  you should stop taking Nevirapine Teva.  \n \nI f you exper ience symptoms suggesting a damage of the liver , such as  \n- loss of appetite,  \n- feeling sick (nausea),  \n- vomiting,  \n- yellow skin (jaundice),  \n- abdominal pain  \nyou should discontinue taking Nevirapine Teva and must contact your doctor immediately.  \n \nIf you develop severe liver, skin or hypersensitivity reactions whilst taking Nevirapine Teva, \nNEVER TAKE Nevirapine Teva again without referring to your doctor.  \nYou must take the dose of Nevirapine Teva as prescribed by your doctor. This is especially \nimportant within the first 14 days of treatment (see more information in \u201cHow to take Nevirapine \nTeva\u201d). \n \nThe following patients are at increased risk of developing liver problems:  \n- women  \n- infected with hepatitis B or C  \n- abnormal liver function tests  \n- treatment-na\u00efve patients with higher CD4 cell counts at the start of Nevirapine Teva therapy \n\n(women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3)  \n- pre-treated patients with detectable HIV-1 plasma viral load and higher CD4 cell counts at the  \n\n\n\n37 \n\nstart of nevirapine therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3) \n \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection (AIDS \ndefining illness), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after \nanti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the \nbody\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no \nobvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.  \n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nChanges of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Contact your \ndoctor if you notice changes in body fat (see section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d).   \n \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis  (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe weakness of the \nimmune system and higher body mass index may be some of the many risk factors for developing this \ndisease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and \nshoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. \n \nIf you are taking nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly please inform your doctor since he might \nneed to check your white blood cells. \n \nDo not take Nevirapine Teva after an exposure to HIV unless you have been diagnosed with HIV and \ninstructed to do so by your doctor. Nevirapine Teva is not a cure for HIV infection. Therefore, you \nmay continue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with HIV infection. You should \ntherefore remain in regular contact with your doctor. You can still pass on HIV when taking this \nmedicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people. \n \nPrednisone should not be used to treat a rash related to Nevirapine Teva. \n \nIf you are taking oral contraceptives (e.g. \u201cpill\u201c) or other hormonal methods of birth control during \ntreatment with Nevirapine Teva you should use a barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) in addition to \nprevent pregnancy and further HIV transmission.  \nIf you are receiving post-menopausal hormone therapy, ask your doctor for advice before taking this \nmedicine. \n \nIf you are taking or are prescribed rifampicin to treat tuberculosis please inform your doctor before \ntaking this medicine with Nevirapine Teva. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nNevirapine Teva tablets can be taken by: \n- children 16 years of age or older \n- children under 16 years of age who: \n\n- weigh 50 kg or more \n- or have a body surface area above 1.25 square metres. \n\n \nFor children under 16 years of age who weigh less than 50 kg or whose body surface area is below \n1.25 m2 other nevirapine containing oral formulations are available and should be used if appropriate. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nOther medicines and Nevirapine Teva \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking before you start taking \nNevirapine Teva. Your doctor might need to monitor whether your other medicines are still working \nand adjust doses. Carefully read the package leaflet of all other HIV medicinal products you are taking \nin combination with Nevirapine Teva.  \n \nIt is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken:  \n \n- St John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum, medicine to treat depression) \n- rifampicin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)  \n- rifabutin (medicine to treat tuberculosis)  \n- macrolides e.g. clarithromycin (medicine to treat bacterial infections)  \n- fluconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)  \n- ketoconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)  \n- itraconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections)  \n- methadone (medicine used for treatment of opiate addicts)  \n- warfarin (medicine to reduce blood clotting)  \n- hormonal contraceptives (e.g. the \u201cpill\u201d) \n- atazanavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)  \n- lopinavir/ritonavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)  \n- fosamprenavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) \n- efavirenz (another medicine to treat HIV-infection)  \n- etravirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) \n- rilpivirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) \n- delavirdine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) \n- zidovudine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) \n- boceprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C) \n- telaprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C) \n- elvitegravir/cobicistat (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) \n \nYour doctor will carefully monitor the effect of Nevirapine Teva and any of these medicines if you are \ntaking them together.   \n \nIf you are undergoing kidney dialysis, your doctor may consider a dose adjustment of Nevirapine \nTeva. This is because Nivirapine Teva can be partly washed out of your blood by dialysis.  \n \nNevirapine Teva with food and drink \nThere are no restrictions on taking Nevirapine Teva with food and drink.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nYou should stop breast-feeding if you are taking Nevirapine Teva. It is in general recommended that \nyou do not breast-feed if you have HIV infection because it is possible that your baby can become \ninfected with HIV through your breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may experience fatigue when taking Nevirapine Teva. Use caution when engaging in activities \nsuch as driving, using any tools or machines. If you experience fatigue you should avoid potentially \nhazardous tasks such as driving or using any tools or machines.  \n \nNevirapine Teva contains lactose  \nNevirapine Teva tablets contain lactose (milk sugar). \n\n\n\n39 \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking Nevirapine Teva. \n \n \n3. How to take Nevirapine Teva \n \nYou should not use Nevirapine Teva on its own. You must take it with at least two other antiretroviral \nmedicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you. \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nDose: \n \nThe dose is one 200 mg tablet per day for the first 14 days of treatment (\u201clead-in\u201d period). After \n14 days, the recommended dose is one 200 mg tablet twice a day. \n \nIt is very important that you take only one Nevirapine Teva tablet a day for the first 14 days (\u201dlead-in\u201d \nperiod) If you have any rash during this period, do not increase the dose but consult your doctor.  \n \nThe 14-day \u201clead-in\u201d period has been shown to lower the risk of skin rash. \n \nAs Nevirapine Teva must always be taken together with other HIV antiretroviral medicines, you \nshould follow the instructions for your other medicines carefully. These are supplied in the package \nleaflets for those medicines. \n \nYou should continue to take Nevirapine Teva for as long as instructed by your doctor.  \n \nAs explained in \u201dWarnings and precautions\u201d, above, your doctor will monitor you with liver tests or \nfor undesirable effects such as rash. Depending on the outcome your doctor may decide to interrupt or \nstop your Nevirapine Teva treatment. Your doctor might then decide to restart you on a lower dose.  \n \nOnly take Nevirapine Teva tablets by mouth. Do not chew your tablets. You may take Nevirapine \nTeva with or without food. \n \nIf you take more Nevirapine Teva than you should  \nDo not take more Nevirapine Teva than prescribed by your doctor and described in this leaflet. There \nis at present little information on the effects of Nevirapine Teva overdose. Consult your doctor if you \nhave taken more Nevirapine Teva than you should.  \n \nIf you forget to take Nevirapine Teva  \nTry not to miss a dose. If you notice that you have missed a dose within 8 hours of when it was due, \ntake the missed dose as soon as possible. If it has been more than 8 hours since the dose was due only \ntake the next dose at the usual time.  \n \nIf you stop taking Nevirapine Teva  \nTaking all doses at the appropriate times: \n- greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines. \n- reduces the chances of your HIV infection becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines. \n \nIt is important that you continue taking Nevirapine Teva correctly, as described above, unless your \ndoctor instructs you to stop. \n \nIf you stop taking Nevirapine Teva for more than 7 days your doctor will instruct you to start the 14 \nday 'lead-in' period (described above) once again, before returning to the twice daily dose.  \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nAs mentioned in \u2018Warnings and precautions ', above, the most important side effects of \nNevirapine Teva are severe and life threatening skin reactions and serious liver damage. These \nreactions occur mainly in the first 18 weeks of treatment with Nevirapine Teva. This is therefore \nan important period which requires close monitoring by your doctor.  \n \nIf you ever observe any rash symptoms, inform your doctor immediately.  \n \nWhen rash occurs it is normally mild to moderate. However, in some patients a rash, which appears as \na blistering skin reaction, can be severe or life-threatening (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis) and deaths have been recorded. Most of the cases of both severe rash and \nmild/moderate rash occur in the first six weeks of treatment.   \n \nIf rash occurs and you also feel sick, you must stop treatment and visit your doctor immediately.  \n \nHypersensitivity (allergic) reactions can occur. Such reactions may appear in the form of anaphylaxis \n(a severe form of allergic reaction) with symptoms such as:  \n- rash  \n- swelling of the face  \n- difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm) \n- anaphylactic shock \nHypersensitivity reactions can also occur as rash with other side effects such as:  \n- fever  \n- blistering of your skin  \n- mouth sores  \n- inflammation of the eye  \n- swelling of the face  \n- general swelling  \n- shortness of breath  \n- muscle or joint pain  \n- a reduction in the numbers of your white blood cells (granulocytopenia)  \n- general feelings of illness  \n- severe problems with liver or kidneys (liver or kidney failure). \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you experience rash and any of the other side effects of a \nhypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. Such reactions can be life-threatening.  \n \nAbnormal liver functioning has been reported with the use of Nevirapine Teva. This includes some \ncases of inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can be sudden and intense (fulminant hepatitis) \nand liver failure, which can be both fatal.  \n \nTell your doctor if you experience any of the following clinical symptoms of liver damage: \n- loss of appetite  \n- feeling sick (nausea)  \n- vomiting  \n- yellow skin (jaundice)  \n\n\n\n41 \n\n- abdominal pain  \n \nThe side effects described below have been experienced by patients given nevirapine: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- rash \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n- decreased numbers of white blood cells (granulocytopenia) \n- allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \n- headache  \n- feeling sick (nausea)  \n- vomiting  \n- abdominal pain  \n- loose stools (diarrhoea)  \n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)  \n- feeling tired (fatigue)  \n- fever  \n- abnormal liver function tests  \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \n- allergic reaction characterised by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm) \n\nor anaphylactic shock   \n- decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia)  \n- yellow skin (jaundice)  \n- severe and life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis)  \n- hives (urticaria)  \n- fluid under the skin (angioedema)  \n- joint pain (arthralgia)  \n- muscle pain (myalgia) \n- decreased blood phosphorus \n- increased blood pressure \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people):  \n- sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis)  \n- drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) \n \nThe following events have also been reported when nevirapine has been used in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents:  \n- decreased numbers of red blood cells or platelets  \n- inflammation of the pancreas  \n- decrease in or abnormal skin sensations. \n \nThese events are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur \nwhen Nevirapine Teva is used in combination with other agents; however, it is unlikely that these \nevents are due to treatment with Nevirapine Teva. \n \nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents  \nA reduction in white blood cells (granulocytopenia) can occur, which is more common in children. A \nreduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which may be related to nevirapine therapy, is also more \ncommonly observed in children. As with rash symptoms, please inform your doctor of any side \neffects.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\n\n\n42 \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Nevirapine Teva \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n  \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the blister after \nEXP.

nevirapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you have taken nevirapine teva before and had to stop the treatment because you suffered from: - severe skin rash - skin rash with other symptoms for example: - fever - blistering - mouth sores - inflammation of the eye - swelling of the face - general swelling - shortness of breath 36 - muscle or joint pain - general feelings of illness - abdominal pain - hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions - inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) - if you have severe liver disease - if you have had to stop nevirapine treatment in the past because of changes in your liver function - if you are taking a medicine containing the herbal substance st john's wort (hypericum perforatum). this herbal substance may stop nevirapine teva from working properly. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking nevirapine teva during the first 18 weeks of treatment with nevirapine teva it is very important that you and your doctor watch out for signs of liver or skin reactions. these can become severe and even life threatening. you are at greatest risk of such a reaction during the first 6 weeks of treatment. i f you exper ience severe rash or hypersensitivity (allergic reactions that may appear in the form of rash) accompanied by other side effects such as - fever , - blister ing, - mouth sores, - inflammation of the eye, - swelling of the face, - general swelling, - shor tness of breath, - muscle or joint pain, - general feelings of illness, - or abdominal pain you should discontinue taking nevirapine teva and you must contact your doctor immediately as such reactions can be potentially life-threatening or lead to death. i f you ever have only mild rash symptoms without any other reaction please inform your doctor immediately, who will advise you whether you should stop taking nevirapine teva. i f you exper ience symptoms suggesting a damage of the liver , such as - loss of appetite, - feeling sick (nausea), - vomiting, - yellow skin (jaundice), - abdominal pain you should discontinue taking nevirapine teva and must contact your doctor immediately. if you develop severe liver, skin or hypersensitivity reactions whilst taking nevirapine teva, never take nevirapine teva again without referring to your doctor. you must take the dose of nevirapine teva as prescribed by your doctor. this is especially important within the first 14 days of treatment (see more information in \"how to take nevirapine teva\"). the following patients are at increased risk of developing liver problems: - women - infected with hepatitis b or c - abnormal liver function tests - treatment-na\u00efve patients with higher cd4 cell counts at the start of nevirapine teva therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3) - pre-treated patients with detectable hiv-1 plasma viral load and higher cd4 cell counts at the 37 start of nevirapine therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm\u00b3, men more than 400 cells/mm\u00b3) in some patients with advanced hiv infection (aids) and a history of opportunistic infection (aids defining illness), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. if you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. changes of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat (see section 4 \"possible side effects\"). some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). the length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe weakness of the immune system and higher body mass index may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. if you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. if you are taking nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly please inform your doctor since he might need to check your white blood cells. do not take nevirapine teva after an exposure to hiv unless you have been diagnosed with hiv and instructed to do so by your doctor. nevirapine teva is not a cure for hiv infection. therefore, you may continue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with hiv infection. you should therefore remain in regular contact with your doctor. you can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. prednisone should not be used to treat a rash related to nevirapine teva. if you are taking oral contraceptives (e.g. \"pill\") or other hormonal methods of birth control during treatment with nevirapine teva you should use a barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) in addition to prevent pregnancy and further hiv transmission. if you are receiving post-menopausal hormone therapy, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. if you are taking or are prescribed rifampicin to treat tuberculosis please inform your doctor before taking this medicine with nevirapine teva. children and adolescents nevirapine teva tablets can be taken by: - children 16 years of age or older - children under 16 years of age who: - weigh 50 kg or more - or have a body surface area above 1.25 square metres. for children under 16 years of age who weigh less than 50 kg or whose body surface area is below 1.25 m2 other nevirapine containing oral formulations are available and should be used if appropriate. other medicines and nevirapine teva tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking before you start taking nevirapine teva. your doctor might need to monitor whether your other medicines are still working and adjust doses. carefully read the package leaflet of all other hiv medicinal products you are taking in combination with nevirapine teva. it is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken: - st john's wort (hypericum perforatum, medicine to treat depression) - rifampicin (medicine to treat tuberculosis) - rifabutin (medicine to treat tuberculosis) - macrolides e.g. clarithromycin (medicine to treat bacterial infections) - fluconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections) - ketoconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections) - itraconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections) - methadone (medicine used for treatment of opiate addicts) - warfarin (medicine to reduce blood clotting) - hormonal contraceptives (e.g. the \"pill\") - atazanavir (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - lopinavir/ritonavir (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - fosamprenavir (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - efavirenz (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - etravirine (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - rilpivirine (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - delavirdine (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - zidovudine (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) - boceprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis c) - telaprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis c) - elvitegravir/cobicistat (another medicine to treat hiv-infection) your doctor will carefully monitor the effect of nevirapine teva and any of these medicines if you are taking them together. if you are undergoing kidney dialysis, your doctor may consider a dose adjustment of nevirapine teva. this is because nivirapine teva can be partly washed out of your blood by dialysis. nevirapine teva with food and drink there are no restrictions on taking nevirapine teva with food and drink. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. you should stop breast-feeding if you are taking nevirapine teva. it is in general recommended that you do not breast-feed if you have hiv infection because it is possible that your baby can become infected with hiv through your breast milk. driving and using machines you may experience fatigue when taking nevirapine teva. use caution when engaging in activities such as driving, using any tools or machines. if you experience fatigue you should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or using any tools or machines. nevirapine teva contains lactose nevirapine teva tablets contain lactose (milk sugar). if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking nevirapine teva.", "Entity_Recognition":

take it with at least two other antiretroviral medicines. your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you. always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. dose: the dose is one 200 mg tablet per day for the first 14 days of treatment (\"lead-in\" period). after 14 days, the recommended dose is one 200 mg tablet twice a day. it is very important that you take only one nevirapine teva tablet a day for the first 14 days (\"lead-in\" period) if you have any rash during this period, do not increase the dose but consult your doctor. the 14-day \"lead-in\" period has been shown to lower the risk of skin rash. as nevirapine teva must always be taken together with other hiv antiretroviral medicines, you should follow the instructions for your other medicines carefully. these are supplied in the package leaflets for those medicines. you should continue to take nevirapine teva for as long as instructed by your doctor. as explained in \"warnings and precautions\", above, your doctor will monitor you with liver tests or for undesirable effects such as rash. depending on the outcome your doctor may decide to interrupt or stop your nevirapine teva treatment. your doctor might then decide to restart you on a lower dose. only take nevirapine teva tablets by mouth. do not chew your tablets. you may take nevirapine teva with or without food. if you take more nevirapine teva than you should do not take more nevirapine teva than prescribed by your doctor and described in this leaflet. there is at present little information on the effects of nevirapine teva overdose. consult your doctor if you have taken more nevirapine teva than you should. if you forget to take nevirapine teva try not to miss a dose. if you notice that you have missed a dose within 8 hours of when it was due, take the missed dose as soon as possible. if it has been more than 8 hours since the dose was due only take the next dose at the usual time. if you stop taking nevirapine teva taking all doses at the appropriate times: - greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines. - reduces the chances of your hiv infection becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines. it is important that you continue taking nevirapine teva correctly, as described above, unless your doctor instructs you to stop. if you stop taking nevirapine teva for more than 7 days your doctor will instruct you to start the 14 day 'lead-in' period (described above) once again, before returning to the twice daily dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nevirapine teva", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",

{"Title": "4. possible side effects", "Section_Content": "like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. during hiv therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. as mentioned in 'warnings and precautions ', above, the most important side effects of nevirapine teva are severe and life threatening skin reactions and serious liver damage. these reactions occur mainly in the first 18 weeks of treatment with nevirapine teva. this is therefore an important period which requires close monitoring by your doctor. if you ever observe any rash symptoms, inform your doctor immediately. when rash occurs it is normally mild to moderate. however, in some patients a rash, which appears as a blistering skin reaction, can be severe or life-threatening (stevens-johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and deaths have been recorded. most of the cases of both severe rash and mild/moderate rash occur in the first six weeks of treatment. if rash occurs and you also feel sick, you must stop treatment and visit your doctor immediately. hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions can occur. such reactions may appear in the form of anaphylaxis (a severe form of allergic reaction) with symptoms such as: - rash - swelling of the face - difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm) - anaphylactic shock hypersensitivity reactions can also occur as rash with other side effects such as: - fever - blistering of your skin - mouth sores - inflammation of the eye - swelling of the face - general swelling - shortness of breath - muscle or joint pain - a reduction in the numbers of your white blood cells (granulocytopenia) - general feelings of illness - severe problems with liver or kidneys (liver or kidney failure). tell your doctor immediately if you experience rash and any of the other side effects of a hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. such reactions can be life-threatening. abnormal liver functioning has been reported with the use of nevirapine teva. this includes some cases of inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can be sudden and intense (fulminant hepatitis) and liver failure, which can be both fatal. tell your doctor if you experience any of the following clinical symptoms of liver damage: - loss of appetite - feeling sick (nausea) - vomiting - yellow skin (jaundice) 41 - abdominal pain the side effects described below have been experienced by patients given nevirapine: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): - rash common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): - decreased numbers of white blood cells (granulocytopenia) - allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) - headache - feeling sick (nausea) - vomiting - abdominal pain - loose stools (diarrhoea) - inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) - feeling tired (fatigue) - fever - abnormal liver function tests uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): - allergic reaction characterised by rash, swelling of the face, difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm) or anaphylactic shock - decreased numbers of red blood cells (anaemia) - yellow skin (jaundice) - severe and life-threatening skin rashes (stevens-johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis) - hives (urticaria) - fluid under the skin (angioedema) - joint pain (arthralgia) - muscle pain (myalgia) - decreased blood phosphorus - increased blood pressure rare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): - sudden and intense inflammation of the liver (fulminant hepatitis) - drug reaction with systemic symptoms (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) the following events have also been reported when nevirapine has been used in combination with other antiretroviral agents: - decreased numbers of red blood cells or platelets - inflammation of the pancreas - decrease in or abnormal skin sensations. these events are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur when nevirapine teva is used in combination with other agents; however, it is unlikely that these events are due to treatment with nevirapine teva. additional side effects in children and adolescents a reduction in white blood cells (granulocytopenia) can occur, which is more common in children. a reduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which may be related to nevirapine therapy, is also more commonly observed in children. as with rash symptoms, please inform your doctor of any side effects. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 42 listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nevirapine teva", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "all medicines", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset":
