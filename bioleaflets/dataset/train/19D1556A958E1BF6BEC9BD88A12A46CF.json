This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee Section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTegsedi 284 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 284 mg inotersen (as sodium). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution (pH 7.5 \u2013 8.8) \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTegsedi is indicated for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with \nhereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 284 mg inotersen by subcutaneous injection. Doses should be administered \nonce every week. For consistency of dosing, patients should be instructed to receive the injection on \nthe same day every week.  \n \nDose adjustment in case of reduction in platelet count \nInotersen is associated with reductions in platelet count, which may result in thrombocytopenia. \nDosing should be adjusted according to laboratory values as follows: \n \nTable 1 . Inotersen monitoring and treatment recommendations for platelet count \n \nPlatelet count (x109/L) Monitoring frequency Dosing \n> 100 Every 2 weeks Weekly dosing should be \n\ncontinued.  \n\u2265 75 to < 100* Every week Dosing frequency should be \n\nreduced to 284 mg every 2 \nweeks \n\n< 75* Twice weekly until 3 successive \nvalues above 75 then weekly \nmonitoring.   \n\nDosing should be paused until 3 \nsuccessive values > 100. On \nreinitiation of treatment dose \n\n\n\n3 \n\nfrequency should be reduced to \n284 mg every 2 weeks. \n\n< 50\u2021\u2020 \n \n \n\nTwice weekly until 3 successive \nvalues above 75 then weekly \nmonitoring.   \nConsider more frequent \nmonitoring if additional risk \nfactors for bleeding are present. \n\nDosing should be paused until 3 \nsuccessive values > 100. On \nreinitiation of treatment dose \nfrequency should be reduced to \n284 mg every 2 weeks. \nConsider corticosteroids if \nadditional risk factors for \nbleeding are present.   \n\n< 25\u2020 Daily until 2 successive values \nabove 25. Then monitor twice \nweekly until 3 successive values \nabove 75. Then weekly \nmonitoring until stable. \n\nTreatment should be \ndiscontinued.   \nCorticosteroids recommended. \n\n* If the subsequent test confirms the initial test result, then monitoring frequency and dosing should be \nadjusted as recommended in the table. \n\u2021 Additional risk factors for bleeding include age >60 years, receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet \nmedicinal products, and /or prior history of major bleeding events \n\u2020 It is strongly recommended that, unless corticosteroids are contraindicated, the patient receives \nglucocorticoid therapy to reverse the platelet decline. Patients who discontinue therapy with inotersen \ndue to platelet counts below 25 x 109/L should not reinitiate therapy.   \n \nMissed doses \nIf a dose of inotersen is missed, then the next dose should be administered as soon as possible, unless \nthe next scheduled dose is within two days, in which case the missed dose should be skipped and the \nnext dose administered as scheduled. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 and over (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2).  \nInotersen should not be used in patients with a urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) \u2265 113 \nmg/mmol (1 g/g) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 ml/min/1.73m2 (see section 4.3).   \n \nBecause of the risk of glomerulonephritis and possible renal function decline, UPCR and eGFR should \nbe monitored during treatment with inotersen (see section 4.4). If acute glomerulonephritis is \nconfirmed, permanent discontinuation of the treatment should be considered. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section \n5.2).  Inotersen must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients undergoing liver transplant  \nInotersen has not been evaluated in patients undergoing liver transplant.  It is, therefore, recommended \nthat dosing of inotersen should be discontinued in subjects undergoing liver transplantation.   \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of inotersen in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nSubcutaneous use only. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nThe first injection administered by the patient or caregiver should be performed under the guidance of \nan appropriately qualified health care professional. Patients and/or caregivers should be trained in the \nsubcutaneous administration of Tegsedi. \n \nSites for injection include the abdomen, upper thigh region, or outer area of the upper arm. It is \nimportant to rotate sites for injection. If injected in the upper arm, the injection should be administered \nby another person. Injection should be avoided at the waistline and other sites where pressure or \nrubbing from clothing may occur. Tegsedi should not be injected into areas of skin disease or injury. \nTattoos and scars should also be avoided. \n \nThe pre-filled syringe should be allowed to reach room temperature prior to injection. It should be \nremoved from refrigerated storage at least 30 minutes before use. Other warming methods should not \nbe used. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nPlatelet count < 100 x 109/L prior to treatment. \n\nUrine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) \u2265 113 mg/mmol (1 g/g) prior to treatment. \n\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 ml/min/1.73m2 . \n\nSevere hepatic impairment. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThrombocytopenia \n \nInotersen is associated with reductions in platelet count, which may result in thrombocytopenia (see \nsection 4.8). Platelet count should be monitored every 2 weeks during treatment with inotersen and for \n8 weeks following discontinuation of treatment.  Recommendations for adjustments to monitoring \nfrequency and inotersen dosing are specified in Table 1 (see section 4.2).  \n \nPatients should be instructed to report to their physician immediately if they experience any signs of \nunusual or prolonged bleeding (e.g. petechia, spontaneous bruising, subconjunctival bleeding, \nnosebleeds), neck stiffness or atypical severe headache. \n \nSpecial caution should be used in elderly patients, in patients taking anithrombotic medicinal products, \nantiplatelet medicinal products, or medicinal products that may lower platelet count (see section 4.5), \nand in patients with prior history of major bleeding events. \n \nGlomerulonephritis/ renal function decline \n \nGlomerulonephritis has occurred in patients treated with inotersen (see section 4.8). Renal function \ndecline has also been observed in a number of subjects without signs of glomerulonephritis (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nUPCR and eGFR should be monitored every 3 months or more frequently, as clinically indicated, \nbased on history of chronic kidney disease and/or renal amyloidosis.  UPCR and eGFR should be \nmonitored for 8 weeks following discontinuation of treatment.  Patients with UPCR more than or \nequal to twice the upper limit of normal, or eGFR < 60 ml/min, which is confirmed on repeat testing \nand in the absence of an alternative explanation, should be monitored every 4 weeks.  \n \nIn the case of a decrease in eGFR >30%, in the absence of an alternative explanation, pausing of \ninotersen dosing should be considered pending further evaluation of the cause. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn the case of UPCR \u2265 2 g/g (226 mg/mmol), which is confirmed on repeat testing, dosing of inotersen \nshould be paused while further evaluation for acute glomerulonephritis is performed. Inotersen should \npermanently be discontinued if acute glomerulonephritis is confirmed. If glomerulonephritis is \nexcluded, dosing may be resumed if clinically indicated and following improvement of renal function \n(see section 4.3). \n \nEarly initiation of immunosuppressive therapy should be considered if a diagnosis of \nglomerulonephritis is confirmed. \n \nCaution should be used with nephrotoxic medicinal products and other medicinal products that may \nimpair renal function (see section 4.5).   \n \nVitamin A deficiency \n \nBased on the mechanism of action, inotersen is expected to reduce plasma vitamin A (retinol) below \nnormal levels (see section 5.1).  \n \nPlasma vitamin A (retinol) levels below lower limit of normal should be corrected and any ocular \nsymptoms or signs of vitamin A deficiency should have resolved prior to initiation of inotersen. \n \nPatients receiving inotersen should take oral supplementation of approximately 3,000 IU vitamin A \nper day in order to reduce the potential risk of ocular toxicity due to vitamin A deficiency. Referral for \nophthalmological assessment is recommended if patients develop ocular symptoms consistent with \nvitamin A deficiency, incuding: reduced night vision or night blindness, persistent dry eyes, eye \ninflammation, corneal inflammation or ulceration, corneal thickening, corneal perforation. \n \nDuring the first 60 days of pregnancy, both too high and too low vitamin A levels may be associated \nwith an increased risk of foetal malformation. Therefore, pregnancy should be excluded before \ntreatment initiation and women of childbearing potential should practise effective contraception (see \nsection 4.6). If a woman intends to become pregnant, inotersen and vitamin A supplementation should \nbe discontinued and plasma vitamin A levels should be monitored and have returned to normal before \nconception is attempted.  \n \nIn the event of an unplanned pregnancy, inotersen should be discontinued. Due to the long half-life of \ninotersen (see section 5.2), a vitamin A deficit may even develop after cessation of treatment. No \nrecommendation can be given whether to continue or discontinue vitamin A supplementation during \nthe first trimester of an unplanned pregnancy. If vitamin A supplementation is continued, the daily \ndose should not exceed 3000 IU per day, due to the lack of data supporting higher doses. Thereafter, \nvitamin A supplementation of 3000 IU per day should be resumed in the second and third trimester if \nplasma retinol levels have not yet returned to normal, because of the increased risk of vitamin A \ndeficiency in the third trimester. \n \nIt is not known whether vitamin A supplementation in pregnancy will be sufficient to prevent \nvitamin A deficiency if the pregnant female continues to receive inotersen.  However, increasing \nvitamin A supplementation to above 3000 IU per day during pregnancy is unlikely to correct plasma \nretinol levels due to the mechanism of action of inotersen and may be harmful to the mother and \nfoetus.  \n \nLiver monitoring \n \nHepatic enzymes should be measured 4 months after initiation of treatment with inotersen and \nannually thereafter or more frequently as clinically indicated, in order to detect cases of hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.8).   \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nLiver Transplant Rejection \n \nInotersen was not evaluated in patients undergoing liver transplantation in clinical trials (section 4.2). \nCases of liver transplant rejection have been reported in patients treated with Inotersen. Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of transplant rejection during treatment with Inotersen. \nDiscontinuation of Inotersen should be considered in patients who develop liver transplant rejection \nduring treatment. \n \nPrecautions prior to initiation of inotersen \n \nPlatelet count, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) \nand hepatic enzymes should be measured prior to treatment with Tegsedi.   \n \nTransient increases of CRP and platelet levels may occur in some patients after initiation of inotersen.  \nThis reaction typically resolves spontaneously after a few days of treatment.   \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCaution should be used with anithrombotic medicinal products, antiplatelet medicinal products, and \nmedicinal products that may lower platelet count, for example acetylsalicyclic acid, clopidogrel, \nwarfarin, heparin, low-molecular weight heparins, Factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban and \napixaban, and thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran (see section 4.4). \n \nCaution should be exercised with concomitant use of nephrotoxic medicinal products and other \nmedicines that may impair renal function, such as sulfonamides, aldosterone antagonists, anilides, \nnatural opium alkaloids and other opiods (see section 4.4).  Although the population PK analysis did \nnot identify clinically relevant effects of some nephrotoxic medicines on the clearance of inotersen or \non the potential for an effect on renal function, a systematic assessment of co-administration of \ninotersen and potentially nephrotoxic medicinal products has not been conducted. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential \n \nInotersen will reduce the plasma levels of vitamin A, which is crucial for normal foetal development.  \nIt is not known whether vitamin A supplementation will be sufficient to reduce the risk to the foetus \n(see section 4.4).  For this reason, pregnancy should be excluded before initiation of inotersen therapy \nand women of child-bearing potential should practise effective contraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of inotersen in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential teratogenic \nrisk arising from unbalanced vitamin A levels, inotersen should not be used during pregnancy, unless \nthe clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with inotersen.  Women of child-bearing \npotential have to use effective contraception during treatment with inotersen. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether inotersen/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of inotersen metabolites in milk \n(see section 5.3). A risk to the breastfed newborn/infant cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Tegsedi \ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFertility \n \nThere is no information available on the effects of inotersen on human fertility. Animal studies did not \nindicate any impact of inotersen on male or female fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTegsedi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions during treatment with inotersen were events \nassociated with injection site reactions (50.9%).  Other most commonly reported adverse reactions \nwith inotersen were nausea (31.3%), anaemia (27.7%), headache (23.2%), pyrexia (19.6%), peripheral \noedema (18.8%), chills (17.9%), vomiting (15.2%), thrombocytopenia (13.4%) and platelet count \ndecreased (10.7%).   \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nTable 2 presents the adverse reactions (ADRs) listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each \nsystem organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within \neach frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In \naddition, the corresponding frequency category for each ADR is based on the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTable 2.

These \nevents are usually either self-limiting or can be managed using symptomatic treatment. \n \nThrombocytopenia  \nInotersen is associated with reductions in platelet count, which may result in thrombocytopenia. In the \nPhase 3, NEURO-TTR trial, platelet count reductions to below normal (140 x 109/L ) were observed in \n54% of patients treated with inotersen and 13% of placebo patients; reductions to below 100 x 109/L \nwere observed in 23% of patients treated with inotersen and 2% of the patients receiving placebo; \nconfirmed platelet counts of < 75 x 109/L were observed in 10.7% of inotersen-treated patients. Three \n(3%) patients developed platelet counts < 25 x 109/L; one of these patients experienced a fatal \nintracranial haemorrhage. Patients should be monitored for thrombocytopenia during treatment with \ninotersen (see section 4.4). \n \nGlomerulonephritis / renal function decline \nPatients should be monitored for signs of increased proteinuria and reduction in eGFR during \ntreatment with inotersen (see section 4.4).   \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn the pivotal Phase 2/3 study, 30.4% of patients treated with inotersen tested positive for anti-drug \nantibodies following 15 months of treatment. Development of anti-drug antibodies to inotersen was \ncharacterised by late onset (median onset > 200 days) and low titer (median peak titer of 284 in the \npivotal study). No effect on the pharmacokinetic properties (Cmax, AUC or half-life) and efficacy of \ninotersen was observed in the presence of anti-drug antibodies, but patients with anti-drug antibodies \nhad more reactions at the injection site. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of an overdose, supportive medical care should be provided including consulting with a \nhealthcare professional and close observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \nPlatelet and renal function tests should be monitored regularly. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other Nervous System Drugs, ATC code: N07XX15 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nInotersen is a 2\u2032-O-2-methoxyethyl (2\u2032-MOE) phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) \ninhibitor of human transthyretin (TTR) production. The selective binding of inotersen to the TTR \nmessenger RNA (mRNA) causes the degradation of both mutant and wild type (normal) TTR mRNA. \nThis prevents the synthesis of TTR protein in the liver, resulting in significant reductions in the levels \nof mutated and wild type TTR protein secreted by the liver into the circulation.  \n \nTTR is a carrier protein for retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) which is the principal carrier of vitamin \nA (retinol).  Therefore, reduction in plasma TTR is expected to result in reduction of plasma retinol \nlevels to below the lower limit of normal.   \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn the pivotal NEURO-TTR study, in the inotersen treatment group, robust reduction in circulating \nTTR levels was observed throughout the 15-month treatment period, with mean percent changes from \nbaseline in serum TTR ranging from 68.41% to 74.03% (median range: 74.64% to 78.98%) from \nWeek 13 to Week 65 (Figure 1). In the placebo group, mean serum TTR concentration decreased by \n8.50% at Week 3 and then remained fairly constant throughout the treatment period. \n\n0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0\n\n- 8 0\n\n- 7 0\n\n- 6 0\n\n- 5 0\n\n- 4 0\n\n- 3 0\n\n- 2 0\n\n- 1 0\n\n0\n\nS t u d y  W e e k\n\nT\nT\n\nR\n\n%\n C\n\nh\na\n\nn\ng\n\ne\n f\n\nr\no\n\nm\n B\n\na\ns\n\ne\nli\n\nn\ne\n\nL\nS\n\nM\n (\n\uf0b1\n\n S\nE\n\n)\n\nP la c e b o\n\nI n o t e r s e n\n\n \nFigure 1 Percent Change from Baseline in Serum TTR Over Time \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe NEURO-TTR multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was comprised of 172 treated \npatients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN).  The disease \nhATTR-PN is classified into 3 stages such that i) Stage 1 patients do not require assistance with \nambulation, ii) Stage 2 patients do require assistance with ambulation, and iii) Stage 3 patients are \nbound to wheelchair.  Subjects with Stage 1 and Stage 2 hATTR-PN and an NIS \u226510 and \u2264130 were \nrecruited in the pivotal NEURO-TTR study. The study evaluated 284 mg inotersen administered as \none subcutaneous injection once per week, for 65 weeks of treatment. Patients were randomised 2:1 to \nreceive either inotersen or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoints were the change from baseline to \nWeek 66 in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 tests (mNIS+7) composite score and in the \nNorfolk Quality of Life \u2013 Diabetic Neuropathy (QoL-DN) questionnaire total score. Patients were \nstratified for stage of disease (Stage 1 versus Stage 2), TTR mutation (V30M versus non-V30M) and \nprevious treatment with either tafamidis or diflunisal (yes versus no). Baseline demographic and \ndisease characteristics are shown in Table 3. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nTable 3.

A responder was \ndefined as a subject who had a change from baseline that was less than or equal to the threshold value.   \nSubjects that terminate the treatment early irrespective of the reason or have missing week 66 data are \nconsidered as non-responders.  Statistical significance in favour of inotersen was demonstrated at all \nthresholds beyond a 0-point change. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTegsedi in all subsets of the paediatric population in transthyretin amyloidosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, inotersen is absorbed rapidly into systemic circulation in a \ndose-dependent fashion with the median time to maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of inotersen \ntypically reached within 2 to 4 hours. \n \nDistribution \n \nInotersen is highly bound to human plasma protein (> 94%) and the fraction bound is independent of \ndrug concentration.  The apparent volume of distribution of inotersen at steady-state is 293 L in \npatients with hATTR.  The high volume of distribution suggests inotersen extensively distributes into \ntissues following SC administration. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nInotersen is not a substrate for CYP450 metabolism, and is metabolised in tissues by endonucleases to \nform shorter inactive oligonucleotides that are the substrates for additional metabolism by \nexonucleases. Unchanged inotersen is the predominant circulating component. \n \nElimination \n \nThe elimination of inotersen involves both metabolism in tissues and excretion in urine. Both \ninotersen and its shorter oligonucleotide metabolites are excreted in human urine. Urinary recovery of \nthe parent medicinal product is limited to less than 1% within the 24 hours post dose. Following \nsubcutaneous administration, elimination half-life for inotersen is approximately 1 month. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, sex or race has no clinically \nrelevant effect on inotersen exposure.  Definitive assessments were limited in some cases as covariates \nwere limited by the overall low numbers.   \n \nElderly population \nNo overall differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between other adult and elderly patients.  \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n13 \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that mild and moderate renal impairment has no \nclinically relevant effect on the systemic exposure of inotersen. No data are available in patients with \nsevere renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of inotersen in patients with hepatic impairment has not been studied.  Inotersen \nis not primarily cleared by metabolism in the liver, not a substrate for CYP450 oxidation, and \nmetabolized broadly by nucleases in all tissues of distribution.  Thus, pharmacokinetics should not be \naltered in mild to moderate hepatic impairment.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicology \n \nDecreased platelet counts were observed in chronic toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys at 1.4 to \n2-fold the human AUC at the recommended therapeutic inotersen dose. Severe platelet declines in \nassociation with increased bleeding or bruising were observed in individual monkeys.  Platelet counts \nreturned to normal when treatment was stopped but dropped to even lower levels when inotersen \naministration was resumed.  This suggests an immunologically related mechanism.   \n \nExtensive and persistent uptake of inotersen was observed by various cell types in multiple organs of \nall tested animal species including monocytes/macrophages, kidney proximal tubular epithelia, \nKupffer cells of the liver, and histiocytic cell infiltrates in lymph nodes and injection sites. The kidney \naccumulation of inotersen was associated with proteinuria in rats at 13.4-fold the human AUC at the \nrecommended therapeutic inotersen dose. In addition, reduced thymus weight due to lymphocyte \ndepletion was observed in mice and rats. In monkeys, perivascular cell infiltration by \nlymphohistiocytic cells in multiple organs was noted. These pro-inflammatory organ changes were \nobserved at 1.4 to 6.6-fold the human AUC at the recommeded therapeutic dose in all animal species \ntested and were accompanied by increases of various plasma cytokines/chemokines.  \n \nGenotoxicity/ carcinogenicity \n \nInotersen did not exhibit genotoxic potential in in vitro and in vivo and was not carcinogenic in \ntransgenic rasH2 mice. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nInotersen showed no effects on fertility, embryo-foetal, or postnatal development in mice and rabbits \nat approximately 3-fold the maximum recommended human equivalent dose. Milk transfer of \ninotersen was low in mice. However, inotersen is not pharmacologically active in mice and rabbits.  \nConsequently, only effects related to the chemistry of inotersen could be captured in these \ninvestigations.  Still, no effect on embryo-foetal development was noted with a mouse-specific \nanalogue of inotersen in mice, which was associated with ~60% inhibition (individual range up to 90% \nreduction) of TTR mRNA expression. \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or or nurse. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tegsedi is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Tegsedi   \n3. How to use Tegsedi \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Tegsedi   \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tegsedi is and what it is used for \n \nTegsedi contains the active substance inotersen.  It is used to treat adults with hereditary transthyretin \namyloidosis.  Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is a genetic disease, which causes build-up of small \nfibres of a protein called transthyretin in the organs of your body stopping them from working \nproperly. Tegsedi is used when the disease is causing symptoms of polyneuropathy (nerve damage). \n \nThe active substance in Tegsedi, inotersen, is a type of medicine called an antisense oligonucleotide \ninhibitor. It works by reducing production of transthyretin by the liver and so lowers the risk of fibres \nof transthyretin being deposited in body organs and causing symptoms. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Tegsedi \n \nDo not use Tegsedi if: \n\n- you are allergic to inotersen or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6). \n\n- tests show you have excessively low numbers of platelets, the cells in your blood which stick \ntogether helping it clot \n\n- tests of kidney function or protein in the urine show signs of severe kidney problems \n- you have severe reduction in liver function (hepatic impairment) \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n \nBefore you begin treatment with Tegsedi, your doctor will measure your blood cells, liver function, \nkidney function, and protein levels in your urine. You will only be treated with Tegsedi if these are all \nat acceptable levels and your doctor will repeat these checks regularly during treatment.   \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nThrombocytopenia \nTegsedi may reduce cells in the blood responsible for clotting of the blood (platelets), which may \nresult in a condition called thrombocytopenia (see section 4).  When you do not have enough platelets, \nlike in thrombocytopenia, your blood may not clot quickly enough to stop bleeding. This can lead to \nbruising as well as other more serious problems such as excessive bleeding and internal bleeding. \nYour doctor will check your blood for levels of platelets before treatment and regularly during \ntreatment with Tegsedi.  If you stop taking Tegsedi then your blood levels should be checked 8 weeks \nafter discontinuation.   \n \nIf you are taking any medicines that can lower platelet count or stop blood from clotting, for example \nacetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, warfarin, heparin, rivoraxaban and dabigatran, you must tell your \ndoctor before you use Tegsedi. \n \nYou should see your doctor immediately if you have unexplained bruising or a rash of small patches \nof red appearing on the skin (called petechiae), bleeding from skin cuts that does not stop or oozes, \nbleeding from the gums or nose, blood in urine or stools, bleeding in the whites of your eyes.  Call for \nimmediate help if you have stiffness of the neck or an unusual and severe headache because these \nsymptoms may be caused by bleeding in the brain.   \n \nGlomerulonephritis / kidney problems \nGlomerulonephritis is a condition of your kidneys, where they do not work properly due to \ninflammation and kidney damage. Some patients treated with inotersen have developed this condition. \nSymptoms of glomerulonephritis are foaming urine, pink or brown coloured urine, blood in the urine, \nand passing less urine than usual. \nSome patients treated with inotersen have also developed a decline in their kidney function without \nhaving had glomerulonephritis. \nYour doctor will check your kidney function before treatment and regularly during treatment with \nTegsedi.  If you stop taking Tegsedi then your kidney function should be checked 8 weeks after \ndiscontinuation. If you develop glomerulonephritis, your doctor will treat you for this condition.  \n \nIf you are using any medicines that damage the kidney or affect kidney function, for example \nsulfonamides, aldosterone antagonists, and some types of painkillers, you should tell your doctor.  \n \nVitamin A deficiency \nTegsedi can lower your body\u2019s levels of vitamin A (also called retinol). You doctor will measure \nthese, and if they are already low, this should be corrected and any symptoms resolved before you start \ntreatment with Tegsedi. Symptoms of low vitamin A include: \n\n\u2022 dry eyes, poor vision, decrease in night vision, hazy or cloudy vision  \n \nIf you have problems with your sight or any other eye problems when you are using Tegsedi, you \nshould speak to your doctor. Your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist for a check-up if it is \nnecessary. \n \nYour doctor will ask you to take a daily vitamin A supplement during treatment with Tegsedi.   \n \nBoth excess and deficient levels of vitamin A can harm the development of your unborn child. \nTherefore women of child-bearing age should exclude any pregnancy, before treatment initiation with \nTegsedi and should practise effective contraception (see section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d \nbelow). \n \nIf you are planning to become pregnant you should stop taking inotersen including vitamin A \nsupplementation and ensure that your vitamin A levels have returned to normal before conception is \nattempted.   \n \nIf you have an unplanned pregnancy you should stop taking inotersen. Due to the prolonged activity of \nTegsedi, however, your reduced vitamin A levels may persist. It is unknown if continuation of your \n\n\n\n28 \n\nvitamin A supplementation with 3000 IU per day will be harmful to your unborn child in the first \ntrimester of your pregnancy, but this dose should not be exceeded. You should resume the vitamin A \nsupplementation during your second and third trimesters of your pregnancy if your vitamin A levels \nhave not yet returned to normal, because of the increased risk of vitamin A deficiency in the third \ntrimester. \n \nLiver Transplant Rejection \nTalk to your doctor before using TEGSEDI if you have previously received a liver transplant. Cases of \nliver transplant rejection have been reported in patients being treated with Tegsedi. Your doctor will \nmonitor you regularly for this during treatment with Tegsedi.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTegsedi should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years old.  \n \nOther medicines and Tegsedi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might use any other medicines.  \nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you are already being treated with any of the following: \n \n\n- Medicines to prevent blood clots or that lower the platelet numbers in your blood, e.g., \nacetylsalicylic acid, heparin, warfarin, clopidogrel, rivoraxaban and dabigatran. \n\n- Any medicines that may alter your kidney function or may damage the kidneys, e.g., \nsulfonamides (used as an antibacterial), anilides (used to treat fever, aches and pains),  \naldosterone antagonists (used as a diuretic) and natural opium alkaloids and other opiods (used \nfor treatment of pain).   \n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine.  \n \nWomen of child-bearing age \nTegsedi will reduce the level of vitamin A in your body, which is important for normal foetal \ndevelopment during pregnancy. It is unknown if vitamin A supplementation can compensate for the \nrisk of vitamin A deficiency that might affect your unborn child (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d \nabove). If you are a woman of child-bearing age, you should practise effective contraception and any \npregnancy should be excluded before starting the treatment with Tegsedi. \n \nPregnancy \nYou should not use Tegsedi if you are pregnant, unless explicitly advised by your doctor. If you are of \nchild-bearing age and intend to use Tegsedi, you should practise effective contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTegsedi may pass into breast milk. You should consult your doctor if you should either stop breast-\nfeeding or stop the treatment with Tegsedi. \n \nDriving and using machines \nUse of Tegsedi has not been shown to affect ability to drive or use machinery. \n \n \n3. How to use Tegsedi \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose of Tegsedi is one dose of 284 mg inotersen.   \n \nDoses should be administered once every week. All subsequent doses should be injected once weekly \non the same day each week.  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nRoute and method of administration  \n \nTegsedi is for injection under the skin (subcutaneous use) only. \n \nInstructions for use \n \nBefore using your pre-filled syringe, your doctor should show you or your caregiver how to use it the \nright way. If you or your caregiver have any questions, ask your doctor. \n \nRead the Instructions for Use before you start using your pre-filled syringe and each time you get a \nrepeat prescription. There may be new information. \n \n \nGuide to parts \n\n   \n  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains one dose and is for one-time use only. \n\nBefore use \n\nPlunger \n\nFinger Grip \n\nSafety Spring \n(inside body) \n\nBody \n \n\nNeedle Cap \n\nNeedle \n\nInspection \nArea \n\nAfter use \n\nAfter use, the safety spring \nis automatically activated \nand retracts the needle. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n \n\nWARNINGS \n\nDo not remove needle cap until you have reached Step 6 of these instructions and are \nready to inject Tegsedi; \nDo not share your syringe with another person or re-use your syringe; \nDo not use if the pre-filled syringe is dropped onto a hard surface or is damaged; \nDo not freeze the pre-filled syringe; \nIf any of the above happens, throw away the pre-filled syringe in a puncture-resistant \n(sharps) container and use a new pre-filled syringe. \n\nPREPARATION \n\n1. Gather supplies \n\n- 1 Pre-filled syringe from the refrigerator \n- 1 Alcohol wipe (not supplied) \n- 1 Gauze pad or cotton ball (not supplied) \n- 1 Puncture-resistant (sharps) container (not supplied) \n\n \nDo not inject the medicine until you have gathered the supplies listed.  \n\n2. Prepare to use your pre-filled syringe \n\n\u2022 Remove the plastic tray from the carton and check the expiry date.  Do not use if the \nexpiry date has passed.   \n\n\u2022 Let the pre-filled syringe reach room temperature (20 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C) for 30 minutes \nbefore injecting it.  Do not warm the pre-filled syringe in any other way. For example, \ndo not warm in a microwave or hot water, or near other heat sources. \n\n\u2022 Remove the pre-filled syringe from the tray by holding onto the syringe body. \n \nDo not move the plunger.  \n\n \n\n3. Check medicine in the pre-filled syringe \n\n Look in the inspection area to \ncheck that the solution is clear \nand colourless or pale yellow. It \nis normal to see air bubbles in \nthe solution. You do not need to \ndo anything about it.  \nDo not use if the solution looks \ncloudy, discoloured, or has \nparticles.  \nIf the solution looks cloudy, \ndiscoloured or has particles, \nthrow the pre-filled syringe \naway in a puncture resistant \n(sharps) container, and use a \nnew pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n4. Choose the injection site \n\n  \nChoose an injection site on \nyour abdomen (belly) or the \nfront of your thigh. \nThe injection site may also be \non the outer area of the upper \narm if Tegsedi is \nadministered by a caregiver.  \nDo not inject into the 3cm area \naround the belly-button (navel). \nDo not inject into the same \nsite each time. \nDo not inject where skin is \nbruised, tender, red or hard. \nDo not inject into tattoos, \nscars or damaged skin. \nDo not inject through \nclothing. \n\n \n\n5. Clean the injection site \n\n \n\n \n\nWash your hands with soap and \nwater. \nClean the injection site with an \nalcohol wipe in a circular motion. \nLet the skin air dry. \nDo not touch the area again \nbefore injecting. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nINJECTION \n\n6. Remove the needle cap \n\n Hold the pre-filled syringe by the \nbody, with the needle facing away \nfrom you.  \nRemove needle cap by pulling it \nstraight off. Do not twist it off.  \nYou may see a drop of liquid at \nthe end of the needle. This is \nnormal.  \nKeep your hands away from the \nplunger to avoid pushing the \nplunger before you are ready to \ninject.  \nDo not remove the needle cap \nuntil right before you inject.  \nDo not pull the cap off while \nholding the pre-filled syringe by \nthe plunger. Always hold by the \nbody of the syringe.  \nDo not let the needle touch any \nsurface.  \nDo not remove any air bubbles \nfrom the pre-filled syringe.  \nDo not put the needle cap back \nonto the pre-filled syringe. \n\n7. Insert the needle \n \n\n \n\nHold the pre-filled syringe in 1 hand. \n\nHold the skin around at the injection \nsite as your healthcare provider has \ninstructed you. You should either \ngently pinch the skin at the injection \nsite or give the injection without \npinching the skin. \n\nSlowly insert the needle into the \nchosen injection site at a 90\u00b0 angle \nuntil it is fully inserted. \n\nDo not hold the pre-filled syringe \nby the plunger or push against the \nplunger to insert the needle. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n8. Start the injection \n \n \n \n\n \n\nSlowly and firmly push the plunger \nall the way down until the medicine \nis injected. Make sure the needle \nstays fully inserted in the injection \nsite while you are injecting the \nmedicine.  \n\nIt is important to push the plunger \nall the way down.  \n\nYour pre-filled syringe may make a \nclick sound as you push the plunger \ndown. This is normal. This does not \nmean that the injection is finished.  \n\nThe plunger can feel stiff towards \nthe end of the injection. You may \nneed to press a little harder on the \nplunger to make sure you have \npushed it as far as it will go.  \n\nDo not let go of the plunger.  \n9. Push the plunger down \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nPush firmly on the plunger at the end \nof the injection. Hold the plunger \nfully down and wait for 5 seconds. If \nyou let go of the plunger too quickly, \nyou may lose some of the medicine.  \nThe plunger will start to lift \nautomatically which means that the \nplunger has been pushed fully down.  \nPress down again if the plunger \ndoes not start to lift \nautomatically. \n\n \n \n\nSlowly and firmly \npush the plunger \ndown \n \n\nHold \nthe plunger \nfully down \nand wait \n5 seconds \n Wait \n\n5 \nseconds \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n \n\n10. Complete the injection \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nSlowly lift up on the plunger and let \nthe safety spring push the plunger up \nautomatically.  \nThe needle should now be retracted \nsafely inside the pre-filled syringe, \nand the safety mechanism spring \nvisible on the outside of the plunger.  \nWhen the plunger comes to a stop, \nyour injection is complete.  \nIf the plunger does not rise up \nautomatically when you release the \npressure, it means the safety spring \ndid not activate and you should push \nthe plunger again but harder.  \nDo not pull the plunger up by hand. \nLift the whole pre-filled syringe \nstraight up.  \nDo not try to replace the cap on the \nretracted needle.  \nDo not rub the injection site. \n\nDISPOSAL AND CARE \n\nDispose of the used pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nPut the used pre-filled syringe in a \nsharps disposal container right away \nafter use. Do not throw away the \npre-filled syringe in your household \nwaste.  \n\n \n\n \n \nIf you use more Tegsedi than you should \nContact your doctor or pharmacist, or go to a hospital emergency department immediately, even if you \nhave no symptoms. \n \nIf you forget to use Tegsedi  \nIf you miss your dose of Tegsedi, then you should have your next dose as soon as possible, unless the \nnext scheduled dose is within two days, in which case the missed dose should be skipped and the next \ndose given at the scheduled time. \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nLift thumb \nslowly \nback up \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nIf you stop using Tegsedi \nDo not stop using Tegsedi unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - tests show you have excessively low numbers of platelets, the cells in your blood which stick together helping it clot - tests of kidney function or protein in the urine show signs of severe kidney problems - you have severe reduction in liver function (hepatic impairment) warnings and precautions before you begin treatment with tegsedi, your doctor will measure your blood cells, liver function, kidney function, and protein levels in your urine. you will only be treated with tegsedi if these are all at acceptable levels and your doctor will repeat these checks regularly during treatment. thrombocytopenia tegsedi may reduce cells in the blood responsible for clotting of the blood (platelets), which may result in a condition called thrombocytopenia (see section 4). when you do not have enough platelets, like in thrombocytopenia, your blood may not clot quickly enough to stop bleeding. this can lead to bruising as well as other more serious problems such as excessive bleeding and internal bleeding. your doctor will check your blood for levels of platelets before treatment and regularly during treatment with tegsedi. if you stop taking tegsedi then your blood levels should be checked 8 weeks after discontinuation. if you are taking any medicines that can lower platelet count or stop blood from clotting, for example acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, warfarin, heparin, rivoraxaban and dabigatran, you must tell your doctor before you use tegsedi. you should see your doctor immediately if you have unexplained bruising or a rash of small patches of red appearing on the skin (called petechiae), bleeding from skin cuts that does not stop or oozes, bleeding from the gums or nose, blood in urine or stools, bleeding in the whites of your eyes. call for immediate help if you have stiffness of the neck or an unusual and severe headache because these symptoms may be caused by bleeding in the brain. glomerulonephritis / kidney problems glomerulonephritis is a condition of your kidneys, where they do not work properly due to inflammation and kidney damage. some patients treated with inotersen have developed this condition. symptoms of glomerulonephritis are foaming urine, pink or brown coloured urine, blood in the urine, and passing less urine than usual. some patients treated with inotersen have also developed a decline in their kidney function without having had glomerulonephritis. your doctor will check your kidney function before treatment and regularly during treatment with tegsedi. if you stop taking tegsedi then your kidney function should be checked 8 weeks after discontinuation. if you develop glomerulonephritis, your doctor will treat you for this condition. if you are using any medicines that damage the kidney or affect kidney function, for example sulfonamides, aldosterone antagonists, and some types of painkillers, you should tell your doctor. vitamin a deficiency tegsedi can lower your body's levels of vitamin a (also called retinol). you doctor will measure these, and if they are already low, this should be corrected and any symptoms resolved before you start treatment with tegsedi. symptoms of low vitamin a include: dry eyes, poor vision, decrease in night vision, hazy or cloudy vision if you have problems with your sight or any other eye problems when you are using tegsedi, you should speak to your doctor. your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist for a check-up if it is necessary. your doctor will ask you to take a daily vitamin a supplement during treatment with tegsedi. both excess and deficient levels of vitamin a can harm the development of your unborn child. therefore women of child-bearing age should exclude any pregnancy, before treatment initiation with tegsedi and should practise effective contraception (see section \"pregnancy and breast-feeding\" below). if you are planning to become pregnant you should stop taking inotersen including vitamin a supplementation and ensure that your vitamin a levels have returned to normal before conception is attempted. if you have an unplanned pregnancy you should stop taking inotersen. due to the prolonged activity of tegsedi, however, your reduced vitamin a levels may persist. it is unknown if continuation of your 28 vitamin a supplementation with 3000 iu per day will be harmful to your unborn child in the first trimester of your pregnancy, but this dose should not be exceeded. you should resume the vitamin a supplementation during your second and third trimesters of your pregnancy if your vitamin a levels have not yet returned to normal, because of the increased risk of vitamin a deficiency in the third trimester. liver transplant rejection talk to your doctor before using tegsedi if you have previously received a liver transplant. cases of liver transplant rejection have been reported in patients being treated with tegsedi. your doctor will monitor you regularly for this during treatment with tegsedi. children and adolescents tegsedi should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years old. other medicines and tegsedi tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might use any other medicines. it is important that you tell your doctor if you are already being treated with any of the following: - medicines to prevent blood clots or that lower the platelet numbers in your blood, e.g., acetylsalicylic acid, heparin, warfarin, clopidogrel, rivoraxaban and dabigatran. - any medicines that may alter your kidney function or may damage the kidneys, e.g., sulfonamides (used as an antibacterial), anilides (used to treat fever, aches and pains), aldosterone antagonists (used as a diuretic) and natural opium alkaloids and other opiods (used for treatment of pain). pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. women of child-bearing age tegsedi will reduce the level of vitamin a in your body, which is important for normal foetal development during pregnancy. it is unknown if vitamin a supplementation can compensate for the risk of vitamin a deficiency that might affect your unborn child (see \"warnings and precautions\" above). if you are a woman of child-bearing age, you should practise effective contraception and any pregnancy should be excluded before starting the treatment with tegsedi. pregnancy you should not use tegsedi if you are pregnant, unless explicitly advised by your doctor. if you are of child-bearing age and intend to use tegsedi, you should practise effective contraception. breast-feeding tegsedi may pass into breast milk. you should consult your doctor if you should either stop breast- feeding or stop the treatment with tegsedi. driving and using machines use of tegsedi has not been shown to affect ability to

tegsedi", "Section_Content": "always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the recommended dose of tegsedi is one dose of 284 mg inotersen. doses should be administered once every week. all subsequent doses should be injected once weekly on the same day each week. route and method of administration tegsedi is for injection under the skin (subcutaneous use) only. instructions for use before using your pre-filled syringe, your doctor should show you or your caregiver how to use it the right way. if you or your caregiver have any questions, ask your doctor. read the instructions for use before you start using your pre-filled syringe and each time you get a repeat prescription. there may be new information. guide to parts each pre-filled syringe contains one dose and is for one-time use only. before use plunger finger grip safety spring (inside body) body needle cap needle inspection area after use after use, the safety spring is automatically activated and retracts the needle. warnings do not remove needle cap until you have reached step 6 of these instructions and are ready to inject tegsedi; do not share your syringe with another person or re-use your syringe; do not use if the pre-filled syringe is dropped onto a hard surface or is damaged; do not freeze the pre-filled syringe; if any of the above happens, throw away the pre-filled syringe in a puncture-resistant (sharps) container and use a new pre-filled syringe. preparation 1. gather supplies - 1 pre-filled syringe from the refrigerator - 1 alcohol wipe (not supplied) - 1 gauze pad or cotton ball (not supplied) - 1 puncture-resistant (sharps) container (not supplied) do not inject the medicine until you have gathered the supplies listed. 2. prepare to use your pre-filled syringe remove the plastic tray from the carton and check the expiry date. do not use if the expiry date has passed. let the pre-filled syringe reach room temperature (20 to 25 ) for 30 minutes before injecting it. do not warm the pre-filled syringe in any other way. for example, do not warm in a microwave or hot water, or near other heat sources. remove the pre-filled syringe from the tray by holding onto the syringe body. do not move the plunger. 3. check medicine in the pre-filled syringe look in the inspection area to check that the solution is clear and colourless or pale yellow. it is normal to see air bubbles in the solution. you do not need to do anything about it. do not use if the solution looks cloudy, discoloured, or has particles. if the solution looks cloudy, discoloured or has particles, throw the pre-filled syringe away in a puncture resistant (sharps) container, and use a new pre-filled syringe. 4. choose the injection site choose an injection site on your abdomen (belly) or the front of your thigh. the injection site may also be on the outer area of the upper arm if tegsedi is administered by a caregiver. do not inject into the 3cm area around the belly-button (navel). do not inject into the same site each time. do not inject where skin is bruised, tender, red or hard. do not inject into tattoos, scars or damaged skin. do not inject through clothing. 5. clean the injection site wash your hands with soap and water. clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe in a circular motion. let the skin air dry. do not touch the area again before injecting. injection 6. remove the needle cap hold the pre-filled syringe by the body, with the needle facing away from you. remove needle cap by pulling it straight off. do not twist it off. you may see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. this is normal. keep your hands away from the plunger to avoid pushing the plunger before you are ready to inject. do not remove the needle cap until right before you inject. do not pull the cap off while holding the pre-filled syringe by the plunger. always hold by the body of the syringe. do not let the needle touch any surface. do not remove any air bubbles from the pre-filled syringe. do not put the needle cap back onto the pre-filled syringe. 7. insert the needle hold the pre-filled syringe in 1 hand. hold the skin around at the injection site as your healthcare provider has instructed you. you should either gently pinch the skin at the injection site or give the injection without pinching the skin. slowly insert the needle into the chosen injection site at a 90\u00b0 angle until it is fully inserted. do not hold the pre-filled syringe by the plunger or push against the plunger to insert the needle. 8. start the injection slowly and firmly push the plunger all the way down until the medicine is injected. make sure the needle stays fully inserted in the injection site while you are injecting the medicine. it is important to push the plunger all the way down. your pre-filled syringe may make a click sound as you push the plunger down. this is normal. this does not mean that the injection is finished. the plunger can feel stiff towards the end of the injection. you may need to press a little harder on the plunger to make sure you have pushed it as far as it will go. do not let go of the plunger. 9. push the plunger down push firmly on the plunger at the end of the injection. hold the plunger fully down and wait for 5 seconds. if you let go of the plunger too quickly, you may lose some of the medicine. the plunger will start to lift automatically which means that the plunger has been pushed fully down. press down again if the plunger does not start to lift automatically. slowly and firmly push the plunger down hold the plunger fully down and wait 5 seconds wait 5 seconds 34 10. complete the injection slowly lift up on the plunger and let the safety spring push the plunger up automatically. the needle should now be retracted safely inside the pre-filled syringe, and the safety mechanism spring visible on the outside of the plunger. when the plunger comes to a stop, your injection is complete. if the plunger does not rise up automatically when you release the pressure, it means the safety spring did not activate and you should push the plunger again but harder. do not pull the plunger up by hand. lift the whole pre-filled syringe straight up. do not try to replace the cap on the retracted needle. do not rub the injection site. disposal and care dispose of the used pre-filled syringe put the used pre-filled syringe in a sharps disposal container right away after use. do not throw away the pre-filled syringe in your household waste. if you use more tegsedi than you should contact your doctor or pharmacist, or go to a hospital emergency department immediately, even if you have no symptoms. if you forget to use tegsedi if you miss your dose of tegsedi, then you should have your next dose as soon as possible, unless the next scheduled dose is within two days, in which case the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose given at the scheduled time. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. lift thumb slowly back up 35 if you stop using tegsedi do not stop using tegsedi unless your doctor tells you to. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "tegsedi", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this
