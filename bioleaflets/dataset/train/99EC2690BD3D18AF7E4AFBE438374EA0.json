NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nKRYSTEXXA 8 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 8 mg of pegloticase (8 mg/ml concentrate). The strength indicates the quantity of \nthe uricase moiety of pegloticase without consideration of the PEGylation. \n \nThe active substance pegloticase is a covalent conjugate of uricase produced by a genetically modified \nstrain of Escherichia coli and monomethoxypoly (ethylene glycol). \n \nThe potency of this product should not be compared to the one of another pegylated or non-pegylated \nprotein of the same therapeutic class. \n \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1 \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear to slightly opalescent, colourless solution at pH 7.3\u00b10.3. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKRYSTEXXA is indicated for the treatment of severe debilitating chronic tophaceous gout in adult \npatients who may also have erosive joint involvement and who have failed to normalize serum uric \nacid with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or for whom these \nmedicines are contraindicated (see section 4.4). \n \nThe decision to treat with KRYSTEXXA should be based on an on-going assessment of the benefits \nand risks for the individual patient (see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of severe refractory chronic gout. \n \nThe medicinal product should be administered in a healthcare setting and by healthcare professionals \nprepared to manage anaphylaxis and infusion reactions. Close monitoring is required during the \ninfusion and for at least 2 hours after the end of the infusion. Availability of resuscitation equipment \nmust be ensured. Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 8 mg pegloticase given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks. \n \nPrior to infusion, patients should receive pre-medication to minimize the risk of infusion-related \nreactions, e.g. antihistamine the evening before, and again approximately 30 minutes before the \ninfusion, as well as paracetamol and a corticosteroid immediately before each infusion (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nMonitoring of serum uric acid level is required prior to each infusion. KRYSTEXXA should not be \nadministered if two consecutive levels above 6 mg/dl (360 \u00b5mol/L) have been measured (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nBefore starting the treatment and especially before monitoring the serum uric acid levels, patients \nshould discontinue oral urate-lowering medication and not institute therapy with oral urate-lowering \nmedication while taking KRYSTEXXA (see section 4.4). \n \nThe optimal treatment duration has not been established (see section 4.4). The duration of treatment \nshould be based upon maintenance of response (serum uric acid levels < 6 mg/dl) and clinical \njudgment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nBased on similar efficacy and safety profiles of pegloticase in patients with creatinine clearance \nbelow and above 50 ml/min, no dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients 65 years of age and older (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of KRYSTEXXA in children and adolescents aged below 18 years has not \nbeen established. No data are available.   \n \nMethod of administration \nKRYSTEXXA, once diluted with 250 ml of sodium chloride solution, 4.5 mg/ml (0.45%) or 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%), is administered as an intravenous infusion over no less than 2 hours, at a flow rate of \napproximately 2 ml/minute.  \n \nFor instructions on the preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and other cellular metabolic disorders known \nto cause haemolysis and methemoglobinemia. All patients at higher risk for G6PD deficiency (e.g., \npatients of African or Mediterranean ancestry) should be screened for G6PD deficiency before starting \nKRYSTEXXA.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe benefit/risk balance should be assessed for each individual patient on an on-going basis \nconsidering the effect on tophus resolution as well as the risk of infusion reactions, gout flares, and \npotentially increased cardiac risk. The long-term risk of prophylactic medications to prevent infusion \nreactions, such as glucocorticoids, should also be taken into consideration.  \n \nThe data for long-term treatment from controlled clinical studies are limited. This should be \nconsidered when the decision is made for a therapy longer than 6 months. \n \nInfusion-related reactions / Anaphylaxis \nKRYSTEXXA can induce severe allergic responses, including anaphylactic shock with cardiac arrest. \nSpecial attention is recommended for patients with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease. \n \nPatients should be pre-treated with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and paracetamol, and closely \nmonitored for the onset of adverse reactions suggesting severe hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylaxis for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion (see section 4.8). If an infusion reaction \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\noccurs during the administration, the infusion may be slowed, or stopped and restarted at a slower rate, \nat the discretion of the physician. \n \nMost infusion-related reactions have been observed after loss of therapeutic response due to the \ndevelopment of anti-pegloticase antibodies, i.e. when serum uric acid values were above 6 mg/dl \n(360 \u00b5mol/L). Therefore, monitoring of serum uric acid level is required prior to each infusion. \nKRYSTEXXA should be discontinued if 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dl have been measured.  \n \nSince concomitant use of oral urate-lowering therapy may potentially mask the rise of serum uric acid \nassociated with the loss of response, patients taking concomitant oral urate-lowering therapy may be at \nincreased risk of infusion reactions and/or anaphylaxis. It is therefore recommended to discontinue \noral urate-lowering medications before starting treatment and not institute therapy with oral urate-\nlowering agents while taking KRYSTEXXA.  \n \nAcute gouty attacks (gout flare) \nAn increase in gout flares is frequently observed upon treatment initiation, probably as a result of \nmobilization of urate from tissue deposits. To reduce the likelihood of gout flares after initiation of \nKRYSTEXXA prophylaxis with colchicine or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is \nrecommended. It is recommended to start this treatment 1 week before initiation of KRYSTEXXA and \ncontinue for at least 6 months, unless medically contraindicated or not tolerated. \n \nKRYSTEXXA does not need to be interrupted because of a gout flare, which should be managed \nconcurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. Continuous treatment with pegloticase decreases \nfrequency and intensity of gout flares. \n \nCongestive heart failure \nKRYSTEXXA has not been formally studied in patients with congestive heart failure, but a small \nnumber of patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions who were treated with pegloticase in \nthe clinical trials had exacerbations of their congestive heart failure. Caution should be exercised in \npatients who have congestive heart failure and patients should be monitored closely following \ninfusion. \n \nHaemolysis and/or Methemoglobinemia \nIf haemolysis and/or methemoglobinemia occur in patients receiving KRYSTEXXA, treatment should \nbe immediately and permanently discontinued and appropriate measures initiated. \n \nPatients over 100 kg body weight \nLower response rates were observed in patients over 100 kg BW; however, confounding factors in a \nsmall sample size make it unclear if in patients over 100 kg BW the dose was optimal to achieve an \neffect. Also, high titres of anti-pegloticase antibodies and infusion-related reactions showed a tendency \nto occur in a greater proportion of patients in this weight group (see section 4.8). \n \nRetreatment with KRYSTEXXA \nVery limited data are available about retreatment after interruption of therapy for more than 4 weeks. \nBecause of the immunogenicity of KRYSTEXXA, patients receiving retreatment may be at increased \nrisk of infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis. It is therefore recommended that patients \ngiven repeat infusions of KRYSTEXXA after a treatment interruption be monitored carefully. \n \nSodium intake  \nKRYSTEXXA contains 4.2 mg sodium (less than 1 mmol) per dose (essentially sodium free).  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nAs anti-pegloticase antibodies can bind to the PEG moiety of KRYSTEXXA, there may be potential \nfor binding to other PEGylated products. It is unknown whether the development of anti-PEG \nantibodies may reduce the efficacy of other PEGylated medicinal products.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use in pregnant women. The embryofetal development study in rats does \nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. The results of the \non-going reproductive toxicity studies are not available (see section 5.3). KRYSTEXXA is not \nrecommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether pegloticase or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, KRYSTEXXA should not be used during \nbreast-feeding unless the clear benefit to the mother can overcome the unknown risk to the \nnewborn/infant.  \n \nFertility \nEffect on male and female fertility has not been studied. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKRYSTEXXA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients \nexperience treatment-related symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react (i.e. headache or \ndizziness), it is recommended that they do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nIn controlled clinical trials, the most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were anaphylaxis, \nwhich occurred at a frequency of 6.5% (8/123) in patients treated with 8 mg every 2 weeks; infusion \nreactions, which occurred at a frequency of 26% and gout flares, which were more common during the \nfirst 3 months of treatment.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following convention has been used for classification of the adverse reactions reported in the \nPhase 3 clinical trials (see Table 1 below): very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping and system organ class, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 1.

The first infusion reaction usually occurs after the 2nd \nto 4th infusion. \n \nThe most common signs and symptoms of local infusion reactions are: erythema, pruritus, and rash. \nThe most common signs and symptoms of systemic infusion reactions are: urticaria, dyspnoea, \nflushing, hyperhidrosis, chest discomfort or pain, chills, and hypertension. \n \nAnaphylaxis (characterized by stridor, wheezing, peri-oral/lingual oedema, or hemodynamic \ninstability, with or without rash or urticaria) occurred in 14 (5.1%) of 273 total patients treated with \nKRYSTEXXA in clinical studies. One patient treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks \nexperienced a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. \n \nIn clinical trials, 91% of patients who experienced an infusion-related reaction had a serum uric acid \nlevel above 6 mg/dl (360 \u03bcmol/L) due to the development of anti-pegloticase antibodies. \n \nInfusion-related reactions showed a tendency to occur in a greater proportion of patients with over \n100 kg bodyweight. They were reported in 54% of the patients in the 70 to \u2264100 kg weight group, \n70% of the patients in the >100 to \u2264120 kg weight group, and 75% of patients in the >120 kg weight \ngroup, respectively. \n \nMany infusion-related reactions resolved with slowing, or stopping the infusion, before restarting the \ninfusion at a slower rate. Others resolved with supportive treatment with i.v. fluids, additional \nglucocorticoids or antihistamines, or following discontinuation of the infusion and with epinephrine \nfor anaphylactic reactions.  \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, severe anaphylactic reactions have been reported, including loss of \nconsciousness, circulatory collapse, and cardiac arrest, which required transfer to hospital emergency \ndepartment. \n \nGout flares \nThe frequency of gout flares may increase after initiation of treatment with KRYSTEXXA, despite \ngout prophylaxis with colchicine or NSAIDs, but the frequency and severity of gout flares diminishes \nafter 3 months of KRYSTEXXA therapy. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nIn clinical trials, the percentage of patients that had flares in the first 3 months was 75% in patients \ntreated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks compared with 54% in placebo-treated patients. This \ncompared with flare rates of 41%and 67% in the same groups in the subsequent 3 months, and gout \nflares were infrequent in patients that received pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks for over one year.  \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn clinical trials, anti-pegloticase antibodies (IgM and IgG) developed in 89% of patients treated with \nKRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks and 15% in the placebo group. Anti-PEG antibodies also \ndeveloped in 41% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks.  \n \nHigh anti-pegloticase antibody titres were associated with a failure to maintain normalisation of uric \nacid (<6 mg/dl).  \n \nThere was also a higher incidence of infusion reactions in patients with high anti-pegloticase antibody \ntitres: 46% (18 of 39) in the KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks group compared to 9% (4 of 46) in patients \nwith low or no antibody titres. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose with KRYSTEXXA has been reported during clinical development. The \nmaximum dose that has been administered as a single intravenous dose during clinical studies was \n12 mg. A post-marketing report documented administration of the contents of 2 vials (16 mg) without \nany adverse reaction related to KRYSTEXXA administration. \n \nIt is recommended that patients suspected of receiving an overdose be monitored, and general \nsupportive measures be initiated as no specific antidote has been identified. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-gout preparations, other anti-gout preparations, ATC code: \nM04AX02 \n \nPegloticase is a uricase enzyme conjugated with mPEG at an average degree of substitution of \n40.8 moles of mPEG/mole of protein (10.2 moles of mPEG/monomeric sub-unit of the mature \nhomotetrameric uricase protein). The average molecular mass of pegloticase is approximately 545 kDa \nof which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 137 kDa. \n \nMechanism of action \nPegloticase catalyses the conversion of uric acid into the inert highly water-soluble metabolite \nallantoin, with hydrogen peroxide and carbon dioxide as oxidative by-products. Allantoin is eliminated \nby renal excretion, thereby lowering serum uric acid. This induces a concentration gradient between \nserum uric acid and tissue/joints deposits of monosodium urate resulting in the migration of urate from \ntissues/joints, which makes it accessible to conversion to allantoin. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn clinical trials, the mean plasma uric acid (PUA) levels fell to 0.7 mg/dl approximately 24 hours \nfollowing the first dose of pegloticase in patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks \ncompared with a mean PUA of 8.2 mg/dl in the placebo-treated patients. \n \nPlasma uric acid decreased with increasing pegloticase dose or concentration. Sustained decrease in \nplasma uric acid below the solubility concentration of 6 mg/dl was observed for more than 12 days \nwith single doses of 8 mg and 12 mg. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy and safety of KRYSTEXXA was assessed in two replicate Phase III pivotal trials (GOUT \n1 and GOUT 2) that were conducted in 212 adult patients with chronic gout refractory to allopurinol. \n \nPatients were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive 8 mg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks or placebo \nfor 6 months. The mean PUA at baseline was 9.8 mg/dl. Seventy-one percent (71%) of patients had \nbaseline tophi. The average number of gout flares per patient was 10 during the 18 months prior to \nstudy entry. \n \nThe primary endpoint in both trials was the proportion of responder patients that achieved plasma uric \nacid (PUA) less than 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dl) for at least 80% of the time during Month 3 and Month 6. \n \nAs shown in Table 2, a greater proportion of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks \nwere responders as compared to patients receiving placebo. Responders maintained PUA values \n< 6 mg/dl throughout the 6-month treatment period. Although the 4-week regimen also demonstrated \nefficacy for the primary endpoint, this regimen was associated with increased frequency of infusion \nreactions. \n \nTable 2.

The Pain scores using a visual \nanalogue scale were 44.2 at baseline vs. 28.4 at Week 25 in patients treated with pegloticase 8 mg \nevery 2 weeks compared to 53.9 vs. 57.2 in the placebo group (p\u22640.001). \n \nAmong the other secondary endpoints, reduction from baseline in the number of tender and swollen \njoints were observed in patients treated with KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks while there was little \nchange in patients on placebo. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKRYSTEXXA in one or more subset of the paediatric population in the treatment and/or prevention of \nhyperuricaemia related to Tumour Lysis Syndrome (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nKRYSTEXXA was administered by intravenous infusion with a Tmax of 2.25 h (range: 1.92 \u2013 4.25 h \nfor initial dose). There was potential for some accumulation with the KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every two \nweeks dosing regimen due to the long half-life of pegloticase (214 h; range: 123 - 444 h for terminal \nhalf-life). The mean Cmax calculated on the last infusion was 2.17 \u00b5g/ml (range: 1.25 - 4.77). The mean \narea under the KRYSTEXXA plasma concentration versus time curve at steady-state (AUC0-t) was \n445 h*\u00b5g/ml (range: 223 \u2013 1040 h*\u00b5g/ml). From the nonclinical studies, the elimination of pegloticase \nis via renal/urinary excretion. For the PEG moiety, urinary excretion is likely to be the major route of \nelimination. \n \nThe population PK analyses showed that age, sex and weight did not influence the pharmacokinetics \nof pegloticase. Anti-pegloticase antibodies were associated with an increase in CL and Vc as \ndetermined by compartmental analysis. Clearance was 0.0145 L/h with a range of 0.00904 \u2013 0.0229 \nfor no increase in anti-pegloticase antibodies and 0.0193 L/h with a range of 0.00675 \u2013 0.0340 for an \nincrease in anti-pegloticase antibodies. The volume of distribution was 4.45 L with a range of 2.62 \u2013 \n5.89 for no increase in anti-pegloticase antibodies and 5.77 L with a range of 2.77 \u2013 10.6 for an \nincrease in anti-pegloticase antibodies. \n \nThe Phase 1 pharmacokinetics showed proportionality within the dose interval (0.5 \u2013 8 mg) as \nreflected in Cmax values. However, due to variability in the AUC values, AUC proportionality was not \nseen which might be a reflection of antibody clearance for some of the subjects. \n \nThe PK/PD analysis showed that higher doses were associated with lower uric acid levels and a more \nrapid decrease in these levels than lower doses. Antibodies to pegloticase associated with clearance of \npegloticase resulted in a small stimulation in the elimination of urate. Those subjects that did not have \nanti- pegloticase antibodies that cleared pegloticase  had a significant effect on the stimulation in the \nelimination of urate. Neither body weight nor baseline creatinine clearance had a significant effect on \nthe PD response. \n \nSpecial populations \nNo formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of renal insufficiency on pegloticase \npharmacokinetics. A total of 32% (27 of 85) of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every \n2 weeks had a creatinine clearance of \u226462.5 ml/min. \n \nNo formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of hepatic impairment. \n \nIn the clinical studies, 34% (29 of 85) of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks \nwere 65 years of age and older and 12% (10 of 85) were 75 years of age and older. No overall \ndifferences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger patients, but greater \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nsensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dose adjustment is needed for patients \n65 years of age and older. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of KRYSTEXXA has not been studied in children and adolescents. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeated dose toxicity studies with KRYSTEXXA in rats and dogs, the occurrence of \npegloticase-containing vacuoles was observed in different tissues. The degree of vacuolization and the \nnumber of tissues affected appeared to be dependent both on the applied pegloticase dose and the \nduration of exposure. The potential clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown; however \nno adverse effects were associated with the presence of vacuoles. \n \nNon-clinical studies to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential have not been performed. \n \nIn the pregnant rat study there was no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity at 46 times the \nclinical exposure (AUC).

What KRYSTEXXA is and what it is used for \n \nKRYSTEXXA contains the active substance pegloticase. Pegloticase belongs to the class anti-gout \nmedicines. \n \nPegloticase is used to treat severe long-term gout in adult patients who also have one or more painful \ndeposits of uric acid crystals under the skin that cause difficulty in carrying out daily activities and \nwho do not respond or cannot take other anti-gout medicines.  \n \nHow KRYSTEXXA works \nPeople with gout have too much uric acid in their body. Uric acid deposits as crystals in joints, \nkidneys, and other organs which may cause profound pain, redness and swelling (inflammation). \nKRYSTEXXA contains an enzyme called uricase that transforms the uric acid into a substance called \nallantoin, which can be removed easily in the urine.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive KRYSTEXXA \n \nDo not use KRYSTEXXA \n\u2022 If you are allergic to pegloticase, or other uricases or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 If you have a rare blood problem called glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency \n\nor favism. Your doctor may test you for G6PD before you start KRYSTEXXA. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using KRYSTEXXA: \n \n- if you are currently taking other medicines to lower your uric acid level  \n- if you have been told you have heart failure  \n- if you have ever been told you have an enzyme deficiency that causes anaemia  \n- if you weigh over 100 kg \n- if you have been treated with KRYSTEXXA before \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\nMonitoring during treatment \nYour doctor will test your blood to measure uric acid levels before each dose to make sure that you \nshould continue receiving KRYSTEXXA. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nKRYSTEXXA has not been studied in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. Therefore, this \nmedicine is not recommended in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and KRYSTEXXA \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is \nespecially important to tell your doctor if you are currently taking other urate-lowering medicines \n(such as allopurinol or Febuxostat) or medicines containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) (such as \npegylated interferon or Doxorubicin). These medicines may put you at higher risk of infusion reaction.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use KRYSTEXXA if you are pregnant or \nbreast-feeding, since it is not known how it will affect you or your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nKRYSTEXXA has little or no effect on your ability to drive. If you do not feel well, experience \nsymptoms such as dizziness or headache, or are tired after receiving KRYSTEXXA, you should not \ndrive or operate any machines. \n \nKRYSTEXXA contains sodium  \nKRYSTEXXA contains 4.2 mg sodium per dose which means it is essentially sodium free. \n \n \n3. How to use KRYSTEXXA \n \nKRYSTEXXA should be given to you by a doctor or nurse experienced in the treatment of severe \nchronic gout in a healthcare centre. \n \nHow much KRYSTEXXA is given \nThe recommended dose of KRYSTEXXA is 8 mg. This dose is not adjusted for weight, age or kidney \ndisease. \n \nBefore you start treatment with KRYSTEXXA, your doctor may recommend that you take other \nmedicines (such as an antihistamine, paracetamol and a corticosteroid) to help reduce the risk that you \nwill get infusion-related reactions due to this treatment. Take these medicines as directed by your \ndoctor.  \n \nHow KRYSTEXXA is administered \nKRYSTEXXA is injected slowly into a vein (i.v. infusion) and your treatment will take about 2 hours \nor sometimes longer. If you have a reaction during the infusion, your doctor may stop or adjust the \ntreatment. Your doctor may also ask you to wait after your treatment to be sure that you do not have \nan infusion-related reaction. \n \nYou will receive KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks. \n \nIf you stop taking KRYSTEXXA, and then are treated again, you may be at increased risk of infusion \nreactions, including severe acute allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) so your doctor will monitor you \ncarefully when you restart treatment. \n \nYour doctor will also test your blood to measure uric acid before your next dose to make sure that you \nshould continue receiving KRYSTEXXA. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most \ncommonly reported serious side effects are: severe acute allergic reactions (common), infusion \nreactions (very common), and gout flares (very common). \n \nKRYSTEXXA will be administered by a doctor or nurse who will monitor you for side effects while \nyou receive KRYSTEXXA and for some time afterwards. \n \nSevere allergic reactions (common) include fainting, sudden drop in blood pressure, and cardiac \narrest. Allergic reactions usually happen within 2 hours of the infusion, but may also happen at a later \ntime. \n \nIf you suddenly notice: \n\u2022 a swelling of the throat, tongue or other part of your body \n\u2022 tightness of the throat, hoarse voice or trouble swallowing \n\u2022 a shortness of breath, wheezing or breathing problems \n\u2022 a rash, itching or hives \ntell your doctor or nurse IMMEDIATELY, since any of these may be signs of a serious allergic \nreaction. \n \nThe most common signs and symptoms of local infusion reactions were: redness at the injection site, \nitching, and rash. The most common signs and symptoms of generalised infusion reactions were: \nhives, shortness of breath, redness in the face, sweating, chest discomfort or pain, chills, and high \nblood pressure.  \n \nAllergic reactions may be more likely to occur in patients who weigh more than 100 kg. \n \nAn increase in gout flares is frequently observed when starting KRYSTEXXA. Your doctor may \nprescribe medicines to reduce the likelihood of gout flares after starting KRYSTEXXA. \n \nKRYSTEXXA does not need to be discontinued because of a gout flare. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): hives, skin rash, itchy, dry or \nirritated skin, nausea \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): high blood sugar levels, vomiting, joint \nswelling, flu-like symptoms \n \nUncommon side effects: (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): worsening of a type of heart disease \ncalled congestive heart failure, skin infection, elevated potassium levels in the blood \n \nFrequency not known (cannot be estimated from available data): destruction of red blood cells \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \n \n5. How to store KRYSTEXXA \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nThis medicine will be stored in a healthcare facility where it is administered. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFrom a bacteriological point of view, the product should be used immediately.

As the development of these adverse \nevents may have been prevented in at least some of these cases if the patients would not have been \ntreated with concomitant urate lowering substances, an amendment of the summary of product \ncharacteristics focusing on the importance of stopping treatment with uric acid lowering agents with \nregard to masking the results of serum uric acid values (and therefore increasing the risk for infusion \nreactions and anaphylactic reactions) should be implemented. The revised order of the two \ncorresponding paragraphs is to emphasize the correlation between concomitant medication with urate \nlowering products and serum uric acid measurement. In addition, a further amendment regarding the \nextension of the time of observation following the end of infusion from 1 hour to 2 hours as a \nprecautionary measure has been included along with a statement that delayed-type hypersensitivity \nreactions have also been reported.  \n\nTherefore, in view of available data regarding anaphylaxis and infusion reactions, the \nPharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee considered that changes to the product information \nwere warranted.  \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for pegloticase the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing pegloticase is favourable subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

test you for g6pd before you start krystexxa. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or nurse before using krystexxa: - if you are currently taking other medicines to lower your uric acid level - if you have been told you have heart failure - if you have ever been told you have an enzyme deficiency that causes anaemia - if you weigh over 100 kg - if you have been treated with krystexxa before 22 monitoring during treatment your doctor will test your blood to measure uric acid levels before each dose to make sure that you should continue receiving krystexxa. children and adolescents krystexxa has not been studied in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. therefore, this medicine is not recommended in this age group. other medicines and krystexxa tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are currently taking other urate-lowering medicines (such as allopurinol or febuxostat) or medicines containing polyethylene glycol (peg) (such as pegylated interferon or doxorubicin). these medicines may put you at higher risk of infusion reaction. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. do not use krystexxa if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, since it is not known how it will affect you or your baby. driving and using machines krystexxa has little or no effect on your ability to drive. if you do not feel well, experience symptoms such as dizziness or headache, or are tired after receiving krystexxa, you should not drive or operate any machines. krystexxa contains sodium krystexxa contains 4.2 mg sodium per

"like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. the most commonly reported serious side effects are: severe acute allergic reactions (common), infusion reactions (very common), and gout flares (very common). krystexxa will be administered by a doctor or nurse who will monitor you for side effects while you receive krystexxa and for some time afterwards. severe allergic reactions (common) include fainting, sudden drop in blood pressure, and cardiac arrest. allergic reactions usually happen within 2 hours of the infusion, but may also happen at a later time. if you suddenly notice: a swelling of the throat, tongue or other part of your body tightness of the throat, hoarse voice or trouble swallowing a shortness of breath, wheezing or breathing problems a rash, itching or hives tell your doctor or nurse immediately, since any of these may be signs of a serious allergic reaction. the most common signs and symptoms of local infusion reactions were: redness at the injection site, itching, and rash. the most common signs and symptoms of generalised infusion reactions were: hives, shortness of breath, redness in the face, sweating, chest discomfort or pain, chills, and high blood pressure. allergic reactions may be more likely to occur in patients who weigh more than 100 kg. an increase in gout flares is frequently observed when starting krystexxa. your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the likelihood of gout flares after starting krystexxa. krystexxa does not need to be discontinued because of a gout flare. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): hives, skin rash, itchy, dry or irritated skin, nausea common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): high blood sugar levels, vomiting, joint swelling, flu-like symptoms uncommon side effects: (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): worsening of a type of heart disease called congestive heart failure, skin infection, elevated potassium levels in the blood frequency not known (cannot be estimated from available data): destruction of red blood cells if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "krystexxa", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "all
