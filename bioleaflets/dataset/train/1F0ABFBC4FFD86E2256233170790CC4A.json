This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris 60 mg granules for oral suspension in sachet \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach sachet contains 60 mg macimorelin (as acetate). 1 mL of the reconstituted suspension contains 500 micrograms macimorelin.  \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n \nContains lactose monohydrate 1,691.8 mg per sachet. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGranules for oral suspension in sachet. \nWhite to off-white granules.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is indicated for the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris must be supervised by a physician or healthcare professional experienced in diagnosing growth hormone deficiency. \n \nPosology \n \nAdult population \nThe dose is calculated based on the patient\u00b4s body weight. The recommended single dose of the reconstituted suspension is 500 micrograms macimorelin per \nkg body weight.  \nThe growth hormone release is to be evaluated with three blood samples collected at 45, 60 and 90 minutes after the administration of the medicinal product. \n \nDiscontinuation of therapy with growth hormone (GH) or medicinal products directly affecting the pituitary secretion of somatotropin \nPatients on replacement therapy with growth hormone (GH, somatotropin) or on medicinal products directly affecting the pituitary secretion of somatotropin \n(e.g. somatostatin analogues, clonidine, levopoda and dopamine agonists) should be advised to discontinue such treatment at least 1 month before receiving \nmacimorelin. These substances could lead to unreliable GH stimulation results (see also section 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of macimorelin in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment have not been established (see also section 5.2). No data are available. \nIf macimorelin is administered to patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment, the potential for an increased macimorelin plasma concentration cannot be \nexcluded. It is unknown whether this may affect QTc. Therefore, ECG controls may be indicated prior to the administration of macimorelin and 1 hour, \n2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours after administration of macimorelin (see also section 4.4). Based on current understanding, this potential is unlikely to decrease \nthe specificity of the test. \n \nElderly \nGrowth hormone secretion normally decreases with age. The efficacy of macimorelin in patients aged over 65 years has not been established. In patients with \nage up to 60 years, diagnostic performance of MAC and ITT were comparable. In the age group 60 years up to 65 years, the limited data available do not \nindicate the need for a separate cut-off point. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of macimorelin in children and adolescents below 18 years have not yet been established (see also section 5.2). No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use \nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris granules are to be reconstituted with water and must be used within 30 minutes after preparation. Reconstituted suspension \nshould be administered orally to patients fasting for at least 8 hours and who did not have strenuous physical exercises 24 hours before the test, since both \ncould affect growth hormone levels. \nThe number of test sachets needed is based on body weight. One sachet will be required for a patient \u2264 120 kg, two sachets will be required if the patient \nweighs more than 120 kg. The entire contents of one sachet is dissolved in 120 mL, and two sachets are dissolved in 240 mL, as applicable. \nThe volume of suspension in mL needed for the recommended macimorelin dose of 0.5 mg/kg equals the patient's body weight in kg. For example, a 70 kg \npatient will require 70 mL of the macimorelin suspension. \n \nAssessment of fasted condition and lack of prior strenuous physical exercise \nBefore using Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris it is important to ensure that the patient is in fasting condition for at least 8 hours and did not have strenuous \nphysical exercises 24 hours before the test, since both could affect GH levels. If either of these conditions is not met, the growth hormone stimulation test must \nbe re-scheduled for a new test day. \nDuring the test, the patient needs to stay fasted until the end of the blood sampling. Fluid intake of no more than 100 mL of non-carbonated water is allowed \neach within 1 hour pre-dose, as well as within 1 hour post-dose (see section 4.4). \n \nLong-term use \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMacimorelin is indicated as a single-dose diagnostic test. No information is available on the safety and effects of macimorelin during long-term use. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInterpretation of macimorelin test results  \n \nClinical studies have established that a maximally stimulated serum GH level of less than 2.8 ng/mL (at the 45, 60 and 90 minutes timepoints) following \nmacimorelin administration confirms a diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency. As with all GH stimulation tests, also the macimorelin test results \nshould always be interpreted on basis of the outcome of all examinations within the diagnostic work-up for a patient.  \n  \nThe safety and diagnostic performance of macimorelin have not been established for patients with BMI > 40 kg/m2. Macimorelin induced GH release was \nlower in patients with higher BMI. In patients with high BMI up to 40 kg/m2, diagnostic performance of MAC and of ITT were comparable. \n \nThe cut-off point for macimorelin has not been established in the transition period from late puberty to full adult maturation. In patients between 18 and \n25 years of age, the diagnostic performance of MAC and of ITT were comparable. \n \nQTc prolongation \n \nDuring clinical development, two transient ECG abnormalities were observed in one test subject and reported as serious possibly adverse reactions. These \nECG abnormalities consisted of T wave abnormalities and QT prolongation. \n \nMacimorelin causes an increase of about 11 ms in the corrected QT (QTc) interval by an unknown mechanism (see also section 5.1). QT prolongation can lead \nto development of torsade de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia with the risk increasing as the degree of prolongation increases. The concomitant use with \nmedicinal products that are known to induce torsades de pointes should be avoided (see also section 4.5). Macimorelin should be used with caution in patients \nwith proarrhythmic condition (e.g., history of myocardial infarction, heart failure or prolonged ECG QTc interval, as defined as QTc > 500 ms). For such \npatients, ECG controls may be indicated prior to the administration of macimorelin and 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours after administration of \nmacimorelin. In patients with known congenital or acquired long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of torsades de pointes, the use of macimorelin \nmay only be considered in a cardiovascular clinical unit. \n \nDiscontinuation of therapy with growth hormone (GH) or medicinal products directly affecting the pituitary secretion of somatotropin \n \nPatients on replacement therapy with growth hormone (GH, somatotropin) or on medicinal products directly affecting the pituitary secretion of somatotropin \n(e.g. somatostatin analogues, clonidine, levopoda and dopamine agonists) should be advised to discontinue such treatment at least 1 month before receiving a \ntest dose of macimorelin. Exogenous GH or medicinal products directly affecting the pituitary gland could influence the somatotropic function of the pituitary \ngland and lead to unreliable GH stimulation results (see also section 4.2 and section 4.5). \n \nPatients with a deficiency affecting hormones other than growth hormone (GH) \n \nPatients with a deficiency affecting hormones other than GH (e.g. adrenal, thyroidal and/or gonadal insufficiency, diabetes insipidus) should be adequately \nreplaced with the other deficient hormones before any testing for a deficiency of GH stimulation is performed, to exclude a stimulation failure due to a \nsecondary GH deficiency. \n \nPatients with Cushing\u2019s disease or on supra-physiologic glucocorticoid therapy \n \nHypercortisolism has a significant impact on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Therefore, the diagnostic performance of the test may by affected in \npatients with Cushing\u2019s disease or on supra-physiologic glucocorticoid therapy (e.g. systemic administration of doses of hydrocortisone (or its equivalent) in \nexcess of 15 mg/m2/day) and lead to false positive test results. \n \nPotential for increased oral bioavailability and macimorelin plasma concentration with use of strong CYP3A4/P-gp-inhibitors \n \nDrug-drug interaction studies with CYP3A4/P-gp-inhibitors have not been conducted. \nA potential for increased oral bioavailability and macimorelin plasma concentration with use of strong CYP3A4/P-gp-inhibitors cannot be excluded. It is \nunknown whether such potential interactions may also affect QTc (see above). Based on current understanding, this potential is unlikely to decrease the \nspecificity of the test. \n \nPotential for false positive test results with use of strong CYP3A4 inducers \n \nConcomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers with Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris can decrease macimorelin plasma levels significantly and thereby lead to a \nfalse positive result (see also section 4.5). Strong CYP3A4 inducers should be discontinued and a washout time of five elimination half-lives should be \nconsidered prior to test administration. \n \nPotential for false negative test results in recent onset hypothalamic disease  \n \nAdult growth hormone (GH) deficiency caused by a hypothalamic lesion may not be detected early in the disease process. Macimorelin acts downstream from \nthe hypothalamus and macimorelin stimulated release of stored GH reserves from the anterior pituitary could produce a false negative result early when the \nlesion involves the hypothalamus. Repeat testing may be warranted in this situation. \n \nInformation about lactose and sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose \nmalabsorption should take this medicinal product only if the expected benefit of the test clearly outweighs the potential risk associated with an intake of \nmaximum 1,691.8 mg lactose per sachet. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMacimorelin is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 in vitro. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nCo-administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase the macimorelin plasma concentration, and this, in turn, could yield higher plasma GH levels. Based \non current understanding, this is unlikely to decrease the specificity of the test. \n \nAdministration of a CYP3A4 inducer (such as carbamazepine, dabrafenib, efavirenz, enzalutamide, eslicarbazepine, fosphenytoin, lumacaftor, modafinil, \nnevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, pitolisant, primidone, rifabutin, rifampicin and St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) \nmay reduce the plasma macimorelin concentrations and may affect the diagnostic performance of the test and therefore should be avoided. A sufficient \nwashout time of five elimination half-lives of the CYP3A4 inducer prior to administration of the test is recommended (see section 4.2 and section 4.4).  \n \nNo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed in humans. \n \nMedicinal products affecting growth hormone release \n \nThe following medicinal products may impact the accuracy of the diagnostic test. Concomitant use is to be avoided with (see also section 4.2 and section 4.4): \n\n\u2022 Medicinal products that directly affect the pituitary secretion of growth hormone (such as somatostatin, insulin, glucocorticoids, and cyclooxygenase \ninhibitors such as acetylsalicylic acid or indometacin). \n\n\u2022 Medicinal products that may transiently elevate growth hormone concentrations (such as clonidine, levodopa, and insulin). \n\u2022 Medicinal products that may blunt the growth hormone response to macimorelin (such as muscarinic antagonists: atropine, anti-thyroid medicinal \n\nproducts: propylthiouracil and growth hormone medicinal products).  \nGrowth hormone medicinal products should be discontinued at least 1 month before administering macimorelin. \nSufficient washout time (five elimination half-lives) of medicinal products prior to administration of macimorelin is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products with a potential to induce torsades de pointes \n \nCo-administration of macimorelin with medicinal products with a potential to induce torsades de pointes (antipsychotic medicinal products e.g. \nchlorpromazine, haloperidol, antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin, erythromycin, clarithromycin), anti-arrhythmics Class Ia (e.g. quinidine), and Class III (e.g. \namiodarone, procainamide, sotalol) or any other medicinal products that may induce torsades de pointes) should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use adequate contraceptive methods at the time when macimorelin will be administered. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data for the use of macimorelin in pregnant women. Studies in animals are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The \npotential risk for humans is unknown. Macimorelin is not recommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether macimorelin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made \nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from macimorelin, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of the test \nfor the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data available on animal (see section 5.3) or human male and female fertility.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \nDizziness has been reported by some patients taking macimorelin. In case a patient should be reporting dizziness as side effect, the patient should be instructed \nto neither drive nor use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions associated with Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris reported in Study 052 (see section 5.1) in 154 patients were \ndysgeusia (5%), headache fatigue, nausea (each 3%), dizziness (2%), as well as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, feeling hot, feeling cold, hunger, palpitations, sinus \nbradycardia, somnolence, thirst, tremor, and vertigo (each 1%). Overall, the adverse reactions reported were mostly of mild intensity and short duration \nwithout a specific treatment need. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported in Study 052 are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency: Very common  (\u22651/10); \ncommon  (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon  (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare  (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare  (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \navailable data). \n \n\nMedDRA organ class   Common  Uncommon  Not known \n\nNervous system disorders \nDysgeusia (bitter/metallic taste) Somnolence  \n\nDizziness Tremor  \n\nHeadache    \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders  \nVertigo  \n\n  \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders  \nPalpitations ECG QT prolonged \n\n \nSinus bradycardia ECG T wave abnormal \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Abdominal pain \n \n\nDiarrhoea \n \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions Fatigue Feeling hot  \n\nFeeling cold \nHunger \nThirst \n\n \n\n \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nDuring clinical development, two transient ECG abnormalities were observed in one test subject and reported as serious possibly adverse reactions. These \nECG abnormalities consisted of T wave abnormalities and QT prolongation (see also section 4.4). \n \nThe effects of macimorelin on ECG parameters were investigated in a dedicated Thorough QT study of a supra-therapeutic dose of macimorelin (2 mg/kg) and \nin a single-ascending dose study, which included three dose levels of macimorelin (0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg). Macimorelin causes an increase of \nabout 11 ms in the corrected QT (QTc) interval (see section 5.1). The mechanism for the observed QTcF prolongation is unknown. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of \nthe medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific recommendations after overdose are given. In the event of an overdose, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. Further \npossible undesirable effects in case of overdosing could include headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In patients with a QTc > 500 ms, an ECG \nmonitoring should be applied (see section 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic agents, Tests for pituitary function, ATC code: V04CD06 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMacimorelin is an orally available peptidomimetic with growth hormone (GH) secretagogue activity similar to ghrelin. Macimorelin stimulates GH release by \nactivating growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHSR) present in the pituitary and hypothalamus.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nGH stimulation \nIn dose finding studies in healthy subjects, maximum stimulation of GH secretion was achieved following single dose administration of 0.5 mg/kg \nmacimorelin. Maximum GH levels have been observed approximately 45 to 60 minutes after administration of macimorelin. \nIn a diagnostic study comparing macimorelin with the insulin tolerance test (ITT) stimulated GH concentrations after macimorelin were on average 1.4 fold \nhigher than in the ITT.  \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \n \nThe effects of macimorelin on ECG parameters were investigated in a dedicated Thorough QT study that investigated in a 3-way cross-over design with \n60 healthy subjects the effects of a supra-therapeutic dose of macimorelin (2 mg/kg, i.e., 4 times the recommended dosage) in comparison with placebo and \nwith moxifloxacin. This study showed a mean baseline- and placebo-adjusted change (upper single-sided 95% confidence interval) in QTcF of 9.6 ms \n(11.4 ms) at 4 h post-dose (see also section 4.4), which occurred after the mean maximum macimorelin plasma concentration (0.5 h). A similar increase in the \nQTcF interval was also observed in a single-ascending dose study, which included three dose levels (0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg (2 times and 4 times the \nrecommended dosage, respectively)). All three dose levels studied showed a similar magnitude of QTcF prolongation in the Thorough QT study, suggesting \nan absence of dose dependent changes. The mechanism for the observed QTcF prolongation is unknown. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe diagnostic efficacy of Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris was established in a randomized, open-label, single dose, cross-over study (AEZS-130-052) \ncomparing the level of agreement between the macimorelin test (MAC) results and insulin tolerance test (ITT) results. Four groups of individuals were \nevaluated: three groups of adult patients with different pre-test probability of growth hormone deficiency (Group A (high likelihood), Group B (intermediate \nlikelihood), Group C (low likelihood) and healthy control subjects (Group D)). \n \nFor both the ITT and the MAC test, serum concentrations of GH were measured at 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes after administration. The test was considered \npositive (i.e., growth hormone deficiency (GHD) diagnosed) if the maximum serum GH level observed after stimulation was less than the pre-specified cut-off \npoint of 2.8 ng/mL for the MAC test or 5.1 ng/mL for the ITT.  \n \nGH levels were determined centrally with the IDS-iSYS assay (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd., UK). \n \nThe level of negative and positive agreement between the results of the ITT and the MAC test was used to evaluate the performance of the MAC test. \nNegative agreement is the proportion of subjects with a negative ITT (i.e., those who do not have GHD per the ITT) who also have a negative MAC test. With \na high level of negative agreement, the MAC test will not wrongly diagnose an individual without GHD per the ITT as having GHD. Positive agreement is the \nproportion of subjects with a positive ITT (i.e., those who have GHD per the ITT) who also have a positive macimorelin test. With a high level of positive \nagreement, the MAC test will not wrongly diagnose an individual with GHD per the ITT as not having GHD.  \n \nSensitivity and specificity for both growth hormone stimulation tests (GHSTs) were estimated, assuming all high likelihood AGHD subjects of Group A as \n\u2018true\u2019 AGHD subjects and all healthy matching subjects of Group D as \u2018true\u2019 AGHD negative subjects. \n \nResults  \nOne hundred and fifty-seven (157) subjects underwent at least one of the two tests in this study, 59% were male, 41% female and 86% of white origin. The \nmedian age was 41 years (range: 18 - 66 years) and body mass index 27.5 kg/m2 (range: 16 \u2013 40 kg/m2). Data on both tests were available for 140 subjects; \n38 (27%) in Group A, 37 (26%) in Group B, 40 (29%) in Group C and 25 (18%) in Group D. One out of 154 MAC tests (0.6%) performed failed due to a \ntechnical error and 27 out of 157 ITTs (17.2%) performed failed because induction of severe hypoglycemia (i.e., the stimulus) could not be achieved.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\nThe estimates for negative and positive agreement between MAC and the ITT in the overall study population were 94% and 74% with lower 95% confidence \ninterval bounds 85% and 63%, respectively. Negative and positive agreement between MAC and the ITT in subjects with intermediate or low risk (Groups B \nand C) were 93% and 61% with lower 95% confidence interval bounds 80% and 43%, respectively. These results are based on peak GH values (maximum GH \nconcentrations across all measurement timepoints). \n \nPoint estimates for sensitivity ranged from 0.87 to 0.90 for the MAC and from 0.97 to 1.0 for the ITT, depending on the inclusion or exclusion of data from \nnot matched Group A subjects, respectively. For both GHSTs, the estimated specificity was 0.96, irrespective of the in/exclusion data from not matched Group \nA subjects. \nRepeatability was tested in a subset of 34 subjects who underwent two MAC tests. Agreement between the result of the first test and the second test was \nobserved in 31 cases (91.2%).  \n \nPost-hoc analysis with a cut-off point of 3.0 ng/mL for the ITT \n \nAn exploratory analysis was conducted on the performance of the MAC based on an ITT cut-off point of 3.0 ng/mL. The estimates for negative and positive \nagreement were 95% and 86% with lower 95% confidence interval bounds 87% and 75%, respectively. Repeatability was 97%. Point estimates for sensitivity \nand specificity were 87% and 96% from not matched Group A subjects, respectively. \n \nBoth co-primary endpoints as pre-defined in Study 052 (lower limit of the 95% CI for negative agreement \u2265 75%, lower limit of the 95% CI for positive \nagreement \u2265 70%) are met when using an ITT cut-off point of 3.0 ng/mL and the pre-defined cut-off point for the MAC of 2.8 ng/mL. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe EMA has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in \nthe diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nElderly \n \nThe pharmacodynamics of macimorelin was not sufficiently evaluated in the elderly population aged > 65 years. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n  \nAbsorption \n \nMacimorelin was absorbed rapidly and the maximum plasma macimorelin concentrations (Cmax) were observed approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour and \n10 minutes after oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg macimorelin after fasting for at least 8 hours. A liquid meal decreased the macimorelin Cmax and AUC by \n0.42 and 0.5 fold, respectively.  \n \nThe oral bioavailability may be limited (among others) by first pass metabolism via CYP3A4 (see section 4.5). \n \nDistribution \n \nMacimorelin is moderately bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding decreases with increasing concentrations from 78% at 0.1 \u00b5M to 62% at 10 \u00b5M. \nAt the clinically relevant concentration of 0.1 \u00b5M (clinical Cmax = 11.2 ng/ml = approx. 0.02 \u00b5M), the unbound fraction of macimorelin in human plasma is \n22%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nCYP3A4 is the major enzyme to metabolize macimorelin. Studies to detect macimorelin metabolites did not identify any metabolites. \n \nElimination \n \nAn in vitro human liver microsomes study showed that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme to metabolize macimorelin. \nMacimorelin was eliminated with a mean terminal half-life (T1/2) of 4.1 hours.  \n \nPK/PD relationship \n \nMacimorelin showed a dose-dependent release of GH after oral dosing. A dose of 0.5 mg/kg macimorelin was shown to induce maximal GH release. Maximal \nGH release has been observed at macimorelin plasma concentrations of  \u2265 7 ng/mL. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nNo studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of macimorelin in paediatric patients or in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Only \nlimited pharmacokinetic data are available in the elderly.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data from safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity studies reveal no specific hazard for humans. No studies to assess \ncarcinogenicity and effects on reproduction and development have been conducted.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n18 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient/user \n \n\nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris 60 mg granules for oral suspension in sachet \nmacimorelin \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side \n\neffects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you take this medicine because it contains important information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is given  \n3. How Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is given  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is and what it is used for \n \nThe medicine contains an active substance called macimorelin. Macimorelin acts like a natural hormone and causes the pituitary gland to release growth \nhormone into the blood stream. \n \nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is used in adults to test the body\u00b4s ability to produce growth hormone. It is used when your doctor thinks that you may not have \nenough growth hormone (adult growth hormone deficiency). This is not a treatment for patients who do not have enough growth hormone. It is a test that \nhelps your doctor to diagnose this condition.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is given  \n \nYou must not be given Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic to macimorelin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTo ensure that the test results are reliable, you need to follow the rules below: \n\u2022 Fasting - you must not eat for at least 8 hours before the test, and during the test. \n\u2022 Physical exercise - avoid strenuous physical activity 24 hours before the test. \n\u2022 Drinking - up to 100 mL of still water is allowed each within 1 hour before as well as within 1 hour after macimorelin intake. \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse if: \n\u2022 you have recently been treated with growth hormone (somatotropin) or with medicines that affect the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. \n\nYou need to stop such treatment at least 1 month before the test. \n\u2022 you have recently been treated for Cushing\u2019s disease (disorder which results in high levels of the hormone cortisol) or if you are receiving a high dose of \n\nhydrocortisone medicine, the test may lead to false positive test results. \n\u2022 your body is lacking any other hormone e.g. cortisol, thyroid or sex hormones, vasopressin (in diabetes insipidus), this should be adequately replaced \n\nbefore testing for growth hormone deficiency. Other hormone deficiencies if untreated could lead to inaccurate results in the growth hormone stimulation \ntest. \n\n\u2022 you have heart disease or problems with your heart rhythm (including congenital or acquired long QT syndrome or a history of so called torsades de \npointes tachycardias). Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris can cause changes in the ECG (electrocardiogram) including QT prolongation that are associated \nwith an increased risk for arrhythmias. If occurring, such changes would be timely limited and not last long. \n\n \nIf any of the above applies to you, or if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given this medicine. \n \nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is indicated as a single-dose diagnostic test. No information is available on the safety and effects of macimorelin during \nlong-term use. \n \nPotentially re-test needed in early disease \n \nIf the adult growth hormone deficiency just recently started and if it is due to an injury in a section of the brain called hypothalamus, then the test result could \nbe negative although you have the disease. In such a situation, a repetition of the test may be required. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris must not be used in children and adolescents aged below 18 years, because the safety and effectiveness in these groups have not \nyet been established.  \n \nOther medicines and Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines that can alter your heart rhythm, such as: \n\u2022 medicines to treat psychosis (such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol) \n\u2022 medicines to treat infections (antibiotics such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, moxifloxacin) \n\u2022 medicines to correct the heart rhythm (antiarrhythmic medicines such as amiodarone, procainamide, quinidine or sotalol) \n\u2022 any other medicines that can prolong the QT interval or inducing torsades de pointes \n\n \nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines that could increase the breakdown of macimorelin such as specific medicines to treat: \n\n\n\n19 \n\n\u2022 seizures/epilepsy (carbamazepine, esclicarbazepine, fosphenytoin, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone)  \n\u2022 sleep disorder (modafinil, pitolisant) \n\u2022 mild to moderate depressive episodes (St. John\u00b4s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) \n\u2022 cystic fibrosis (lumacaftor) \n\u2022 infections (antibiotics such as rifabutin, rifampicin) \n\u2022 HIV (efavirenz, nevirapine) \n\u2022 type 2 diabetes (pioglitazone) \n\u2022 cancer (dabrafenib, enzalutamide) \n\n \nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines that may impact the accuracy of the diagnostic test. Avoid concomitant use with medicines:  \n\u2022 that could have a direct influence on growth hormone secretion by the pituitary gland: such as somatostatin, insulin, glucocorticoids, acetylsalicylic acid, \n\nindometacin \n\u2022 that could increase growth hormone levels: such as clonidine, levodopa, insulin  \n\u2022 that could reduce the growth hormone response to macimorelin such as: atropine, propylthiouracil, growth hormone medicines \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or nurse for advice before this medicine is \ngiven to you. Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are a woman able to have children, you must use effective \ncontraceptive methods to ensure you are not pregnant at the time of the test. If you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed, a risk to the suckling child \ncannot be excluded. Please ask your doctor whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from the macimorelin test. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDizziness can occur with Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris. If this happens, do not drive or use machines. \n \nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris contains lactose  \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nMacimorelin Aeterna Zentaris contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say it is essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is given \n \nA healthcare professional must supervise the preparation and use of Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris. Instructions are given at the end of this leaflet on how to \nprepare the test. \n \nThe description in this leaflet is for your information on the testing procedure.  \n \nYou must be fasting for at least 8 hours before you are given Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris. You may not perform strenuous physical exercises 24 hours \nbefore the test.

Dissolve the entire contents of the sachet in water: one sachet in 120 mL, \ntwo sachets in 240 mL, as applicable.  \n \nStir the suspension gently for 2 minutes (a small amount of undissolved particles will remain giving a slightly turbid suspension). The suspension should be \nstirred until it is slightly turbid without particles at the bottom of the container. The suspension should be stirred again, when some particles settle at the \nbottom of the container for example after the suspension is left standing for some time.  \n \nStep 4 \nDetermine the volume of suspension needed for the recommended macimorelin dose of 0.5 mg/kg. The suspension volume in mL equals the patient's body \nweight in kg. For example, a 70 kg patient will require 70 mL of the macimorelin suspension. \n \nMeasure the required volume using a 50 mL graduated syringe without a needle. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21 \n\n \nTransfer the measured amount to a drinking glass. \n \nStep 5 \nHave the patient drink the entire content of the drinking glass within 30 seconds. \n \nThe suspension must be used within 30 minutes after preparation.
