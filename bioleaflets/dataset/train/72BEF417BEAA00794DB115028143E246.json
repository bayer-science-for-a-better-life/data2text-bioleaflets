PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for solution for infusion.\n\nA white to light yellow powder.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRecarbrio is indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in \nadults with limited treatment options (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1).\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nIt is recommended that Recarbrio should be used to treat infections due to aerobic Gram-negative \norganisms in adult patients with limited treatment options only after consultation with a physician with \nappropriate experience in the management of infectious diseases.\n\nPosology\n\nTable 1 shows the recommended intravenous dose for patients with a creatinine clearance\n(CrCl) \u2265 90 to < 150 mL/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1: Recommended intravenous dose for patients with a creatinine clearance\n(CrCl) \u2265 90 to <150 mL/min1\n\nType of infection\nDose of Recarbrio\n\n(imipenem/ cilastatin/ \nrelebactam)\n\nFrequency\nInfusion \n\ntime\nDuration of \n\ntreatment\n\nInfections due to aerobic \nGram-negative organisms in \npatients with limited \ntreatment options\n\n500 mg/500 mg/250 mg\nEvery \n\n6 hours\n30 mins\n\nDuration in \naccordance with \n\nthe site of \ninfection2\n\n1As calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n2e.g. for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis and complicated intra-abdominal \ninfections (cIAI) the recommended treatment duration is 5 to 10 days; treatment may continue up to 14 days. For\nhospital-acquired pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) the recommended treatment duration \nis 7 to 14 days.\n\nThe dose that is recommended for patients with CrCl \u2265 90 to < 150 mL/min may not be sufficient to \ntreat patients with CrCl \u2265 150 mL/min (see section 4.4).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nPatients who have a CrCl less than 90 mL/min require dosage reduction of Recarbrio as indicated in \nTable 2. For patients with fluctuating renal function, CrCl should be monitored.\n\nTable 2: Recommended intravenous doses for patients with a CrCl < 90 mL/min\n\nEstimated Creatinine Clearance \n(mL/min)*\n\nRecommended dosage of Recarbrio\n(imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam) (mg)\u2020\n\nLess than 90 to greater than or equal to 60 400/400/200\n\nLess than 60 to greater than or equal to 30 300/300/150\n\nLess than 30 to greater than or equal to 15 200/200/100\nEnd stage renal disease (ESRD) on \nhaemodialysis\u2021\n\n200/200/100\n\n*CrCl calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n\u2020Administer intravenously over 30 minutes every 6 hours.\n\u2021Administration should be timed to follow haemodialysis. Imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam are \ncleared from the circulation during haemodialysis.\nRecarbrio is provided as a single vial in a fixed-dose combination; the dose for each component will \nbe adjusted equally during preparation (see section 6.6).\n\nPatients with CrCl less than 15 mL/min should not receive Recarbrio unless haemodialysis is instituted \nwithin 48 hours. There is inadequate information to recommend usage of Recarbrio for patients \nundergoing peritoneal dialysis.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 5.2).\n\nElderly population\nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam in children and adolescents below 18 years \nof age have not yet been established. No data are available.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nMethod of administration \n\nIntravenous use.\n\nRecarbrio is administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.\n\nRecarbrio must be reconstituted (see sections 6.2, 6.3, and 6.6) prior to intravenous infusion. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nHypersensitivity to any other carbapenem antibacterial agent.\n\nSevere hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of beta-\nlactam antibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins or monobactams) (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients \nreceiving therapy with beta-lactams (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n\nThese reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple \nallergens. Before initiating therapy with Recarbrio, careful inquiry should be made concerning\nprevious hypersensitivity reactions to carbapenems, penicillins, cephalosporins, other beta-lactams,\nand other allergens. \n\nIf an allergic reaction to Recarbrio occurs, treatment with Recarbrio must be discontinued\nimmediately. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment.\n\nHepatic function\n\nHepatic function should be closely monitored during treatment with Recarbrio due to the risk of \nhepatic toxicity (such as increase in transaminases, hepatic failure, and fulminant hepatitis) (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nUse in patients with liver disease: patients with pre-existing liver disorders should have liver function \nmonitored during treatment with Recarbrio. There is no dose adjustment necessary (see section 4.2).\n\nCentral nervous system (CNS)\n\nCNS adverse reactions, such as seizures, confusional states, and myoclonic activity have been reported \nduring treatment with imipenem/cilastatin, components of Recarbrio, especially when recommended \ndosages of imipenem were exceeded. These reactions have been reported most commonly in patients \nwith CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) and/or compromised renal function.\n\nIncreased seizure potential due to interaction with valproic acid\n\nThe concomitant use of Recarbrio and valproic acid/divalproex sodium is not recommended. \nAntibacterials other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose \nseizures are well-controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of Recarbrio is \nnecessary, supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered (see section 4.5).\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nClostridioides difficile-Associated Diarrhoea (CDAD)\n\nClostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been reported with Recarbrio. CDAD may \nrange in severity from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis. CDAD must be considered in all patients who \npresent with diarrhoea during or following the administration of Recarbrio (see section 4.8). Careful \nmedical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the \nadministration of antibacterial agents.\n\nIf CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinuation of therapy with Recarbrio, and the administration \nof specific treatment for C. difficile should be considered. Medicinal products that inhibit peristalsis \nshould not be given.\n\nPatients with CrCl \u2265 150 mL/min\n\nBased on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses, the dose of Recarbrio that is recommended for \npatients with CrCl from 90 to < 150 mL/min may not be sufficient to treat patients with CrCl\n\u2265 150 mL/min. Consideration should be given to using alternative therapies for these patients.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nDose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2). There is \ninadequate information to recommend usage of Recarbrio for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.\n\nNeutropenic patients and patients with very severe infections\n\nThe recommended doses of Recarbrio may not be optimal to treat i) patients with neutropenia or ii) \npatients with very severe infections. Consideration should be given to using alternative therapies for \nthese patients.\n\nLimitations of the clinical data\n\nPatients with limited treatment options\nThe use of Recarbrio to treat patients with infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms who \nhave limited treatment options is based on experience with imipenem/cilastatin, pharmacokinetic-\npharmacodynamic analysis for imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, and on limited data from a randomised\nclinical study in which 21 evaluable patients were treated with Recarbrio and 10 evaluable patients \nwere treated with colistin and imipenem/cilastatin for infections caused by imipenem-non-susceptible \norganisms.\n\nLimitations of the spectrum of antibacterial activity\n\nImipenem does not have activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and \nStaphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) or against Enterococcus faecium. Alternative or additional \nantibacterial agents should be used when these pathogens are known or suspected to be contributing to \nthe infectious process.\n\nThe inhibitory spectrum of relebactam includes class A beta-lactamases (such as ESBLs and KPC) and \nClass C beta-lactamases including PDC. Relebactam does not inhibit class D carbapenemases such as \nOXA-48 or class B metallo-beta-lactamases such as NDM and VIM (see section 5.1).\n\nNon-susceptible organisms\n\nThe use of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, \nwhich may require interruption of treatment or other appropriate measures.\n\nAntiglobulin test (Coombs test) seroconversion\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nA positive direct or indirect Coombs test may develop during treatment with\nimipenem/cilastatin/relebactam (see section 4.8).\n\nControlled sodium diet\n\nEach vial contains a total of 37.5 mg of sodium (1.6 mmol), equivalent to 1.9 % of the WHO (World \nHealth Organization) recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. This should be \nconsidered when administering Recarbrio to patients who are on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nGanciclovir\n\nGeneralised seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir concomitantly with \nimipenem/cilastatin, components of Recarbrio. Ganciclovir should not be used concomitantly with \nRecarbrio unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nValproic acid\n\nCase reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including \nimipenem/cilastatin (components of Recarbrio), to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex \nsodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may \ndrop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of \nbreakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and \nanimal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide \nmetabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. \nThe concomitant use of Recarbrio and valproic acid/divalproex sodium is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nOral anti-coagulants\n\nSimultaneous administration of antibacterial agents with warfarin may augment its anticoagulant \neffects. It is recommended that the INR should be monitored as appropriate during and shortly after \nco-administration of antibiotics with oral anti-coagulant medicinal products.\n\nClinical drug interaction studies\n\nA clinical drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that imipenem and relebactam exposures do not \nincrease by a clinically significant extent when Recarbrio is co-administered with the prototypical \nOAT-inhibitor probenecid, indicating a lack of clinically meaningful OAT-mediated drug-drug \ninteractions. Concomitant administration of imipenem/cilastatin and probenecid increased the plasma \nlevel and half-life of cilastatin, though not to a clinically meaningful extent. Therefore, Recarbrio may \nbe administered concomitantly with OAT inhibitors.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies for the use of imipenem, cilastatin, or relebactam in \npregnant women. \nAnimal studies with imipenem/cilastatin have shown reproductive toxicity in monkeys (see \nsection 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies with relebactam do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nRecarbrio should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \nthe foetus.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nImipenem and cilastatin are excreted into the mother\u2019s milk in small quantities.\n\nIt is unknown whether relebactam is excreted in human milk. Available data in animals have shown \nexcretion of relebactam in the milk of rats (for details see section 5.3).\n\nA risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to\ndiscontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue Recarbrio therapy taking into account the benefit of\nbreastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no human data available regarding potential effects of imipenem/cilastatin or relebactam \ntreatment on male or female fertility. Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects of \nimipenem/cilastatin or relebactam on fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nRecarbrio has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. CNS adverse reactions, \nsuch as seizures, confusional states, and myoclonic activity, have been reported during treatment with \nimipenem/cilastatin, components of Recarbrio, especially when recommended dosages of imipenem \nwere exceeded (see section 4.4). Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using \nmachines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequently occurring adverse reaction in > 2 % of patients in clinical trials with\nimipenem/cilastatin plus relebactam was: diarrhoea.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during the Phase 2 (imipenem/cilastatin plus\nrelebactam including 431 subjects) clinical trials and with imipenem/cilastatin in clinical studies or \nduring post-marketing experience with imipenem/cilastatin (see Table 3).\n\nAdverse reactions are classified according to MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency \ncategories are derived according to the following conventions: Very common (\u2265 1/10), Common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), Rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), Very rare \n(< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 3: Frequency of adverse reactions by system organ class\n\nSystem Organ \nClass\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Unknown\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nPseudomembranous \ncolitis*\n\nCandidiasis*\n\nGastro-\nenteritis*\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nEosinophilia*\n\nPancytopenia*\n\nNeutropenia*\n\nLeukopenia*\n\nThrombocytopenia*\n\nThrombocytosis*\n\nAgranulocytosis*\n\nHaemolytic\nanaemia*\n\nBone \nmarrow \ndepression*\n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nAnaphylactic\nreactions*\n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nSeizures*\n\nHallucinations*\n\nConfusional states*\n\nMyoclonic activity*\n\nDizziness*\n\nSomnolence*\n\nEncephalopathy*\n\nParaesthesia*\n\nFocal tremor*\n\nTaste perversion*\n\nAggravatio\nn of \nmyasthenia \ngravis*\n\nHeadache*\n\nAgitation*\n\nDyskinesia\n*\n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders\n\nHearing loss*\nVertigo*\n\nTinnitus*\n\nCardiac \ndisorders\n\nCyanosis*\n\nTachycardi\na*\n\nPalpitations\n*\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nThrombophlebiti\ns*\n\nHypotension* Flushing*\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nDyspnoea*\n\nHyper-\nventilation*\n\nPharyngeal \npain*\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nDiarrhoea\u2020*\n\nNausea\u2020*\n\nVomiting\u2020*\n\nStaining of teeth \nand/or tongue*\n\nHaemorrha\ngic colitis*\n\nAbdominal \npain*\n\nHeartburn*\n\nGlossitis*\n\nTongue \npapilla \nhypertroph\ny*\n\nIncreased \nsalivation*\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \nincreased\u2020*\n\nAspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased\u2020*\n\nHepatic failure*\n\nHepatitis*\n\nFulminant \nhepatitis*\n\nJaundice*\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nRash (e.g. \nexanthematous)*\n\nUrticaria*\n\nPruritus*\n\nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis*\n\nAngioedema*\n\nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome*\n\nErythema \nmultiforme*\n\nExfoliative \ndermatitis*\n\nHyperhidro\nsis*\n\nSkin \ntexture \nchanges*\n\nMusculoskeleta\nl and \nconnective \ntissue disorders\n\nPolyarthral\ngia*\n\nThoracic \nspine pain*\n\nRenal and \nurinary\ndisorders\n\nCreatinine renal \nclearance \ndecreased\u2020\n\nElevations in serum \ncreatinine*\n\nAcute renal failure* \n\nOliguria/anuria*\n\nPolyuria* \n\nUrine discoloration \n(harmless and \nshould not be \nconfused with \nhaematuria)*\n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders\n\nPruritus \nvulvae*\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nFever*\n\nLocal pain and \ninduration at the \ninjection site*\n\nChest \ndiscomfort\n*\n\nAsthenia/\nweakness*\n\nInvestigations\nIncreases in \nserum alkaline \nphosphatase*\n\nCoombs test \npositive*\n\nProlonged \nprothrombin time*\n\nDecreased \nhaemoglobin*\n\nIncreases in serum \nbilirubin*\n\nElevations in blood \nurea nitrogen*\n\nBlood \nlactate \ndehydroge\nnase \nincreased*\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\n*reported with imipenem/cilastatin in clinical studies or during post-marketing experience with \nimipenem/cilastatin\n\u2020reported with imipenem/cilastatin plus relebactam in Phase 2 studies (N = 431)\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of overdose, discontinue Recarbrio, treat based on symptoms, and institute general \nsupportive treatment. Imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam can be removed by haemodialysis. No \nclinical information is available on the use of haemodialysis to treat overdosage.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, carbapenems, ATC code: J01DH56\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe bactericidal activity of imipenem results from the inhibition of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) \nleading to inhibition of peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis.\n\nCilastatin limits the renal metabolism of imipenem and does not have antibacterial activity.\n\nRelebactam is a non-beta lactam inhibitor of Ambler class A and class C beta-lactamases, including \nclass A Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases \n(ESBLs), and class C (AmpC-type) beta-lactamases including Pseudomonas-Derived \nCephalosporinase (PDC). Relebactam does not inhibit class B enzymes (metallo-beta-lactamases) or \nclass D carbapenemases. Relebactam has no antibacterial activity.\n\nResistance\n\nMechanisms of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria that are known to affect imipenem/relebactam\ninclude the production of metallo-beta-lactamases or oxacillinases with carbapenemase activity.\n\nExpression of certain alleles of the class A beta-lactamase Guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase \n(GES) and overexpression of PDC coupled with loss of imipenem entry porin OprD may confer \nresistance to imipenem/relebactam in P. aeruginosa. The expression of efflux pumps in P. aeruginosa\ndoes not affect activity of either imipenem or relebactam. Mechanisms of bacterial resistance that \ncould decrease the antibacterial activity of imipenem/relebactam in Enterobacterales include porin \nmutations affecting outer membrane permeability.\n\nAntibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents\n\nIn vitro studies have demonstrated no antagonism between imipenem/relebactam and amikacin, \nazithromycin, aztreonam, colistin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, linezolid, tigecycline, tobramycin, or \nvancomycin.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\nSusceptibility testing breakpoints\n\nMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are as follows:\n\nOrganism group\n\nMinimum Inhibitory Concentrations\n\n(mg/L)\n\nSusceptible \u2264 Resistant >\n\nEnterobacterales (except \n\nMorganellaceae)\n2 2\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa 2 2\n\nAcinetobacter spp. 2 2\n\nViridans group streptococci 2 2\n\nAnaerobes, Gram-positive 2 2\n\nAnaerobes, Gram-negative 2 2\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship\n\nTime that unbound plasma concentrations of imipenem exceed the imipenem/relebactam minimum \ninhibitory concentration (% fT > MIC) has been shown to best correlate with efficacy. The ratio of the\n24 - hour unbound plasma relebactam AUC to imipenem/relebactam MIC (fAUC / MIC) has been \ndetermined to be the index that best predicts activity of relebactam.\n\nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that the following pathogens would be susceptible to imipenem, cilastatin, and \nrelebactam in the absence of acquired mechanisms of resistance:\n\nGram-negative aerobic micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Acinetobacter baumannii\n\uf0b7 Citrobacter spp. (including C. freundii and C. koseri)\n\uf0b7 Enterobacter spp. (including E. asburiae and E. cloacae)\n\uf0b7 Escherichia coli\n\uf0b7 Klebsiella spp. (including K. aerogenes, K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae)\n\uf0b7 Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\uf0b7 Serratia marcescens\n\nGram-negative anaerobic micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis)\n\uf0b7 Fusobacterium spp. (including F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum)\n\uf0b7 Prevotella spp. (including P. melaninogenica, P. bivia, and P. buccae)\n\nGram-positive aerobic micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Enterococcus faecalis\n\uf0b7 Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only)\n\uf0b7 Viridans group streptococci (including S. anginosus and S. constellatus)\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that the following species are not susceptible to imipenem, cilastatin, and \nrelebactam:\n\nGram-negative aerobic micro-organisms\n\uf0b7 Legionella spp.\n\uf0b7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia\n\nPaediatric population\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nRecarbrio in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Gram-negative \nbacterial infections (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nGeneral introduction\n\nThe steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam in healthy adults \nand patients with active bacterial infection with normal renal function after multiple 30 minute \nintravenous infusions of 500 mg imipenem/500 mg cilastatin + 250 mg relebactam administered every\n6 hours are summarised in Table 4 and Table 5. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar for \nsingle- and multiple-dose administration due to minimal accumulation.\n\nThe C max and AUC of imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam increase in proportion to dose.

The binding of relebactam to human plasma proteins is approximately 22 % and is\nindependent of concentration.\n\nThe steady-state volume of distribution of imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam is 24.3 L, 13.8 L, and \n19.0 L, respectively, in subjects following multiple doses infused over 30 minutes every 6 hours.\n\nThe penetration into pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (ELF) expressed as the total ELF-to-unbound \nplasma exposure ratio was 55 % and 54 % for imipenem and relebactam, respectively.\n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nBiotransformation\n\nImipenem, when administered alone, is metabolised in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase-I, resulting in \nlow levels of imipenem (average of 15-20 % of the dose) recovered in human urine. Cilastatin, an \ninhibitor of this enzyme, effectively prevents renal metabolism so that when imipenem and cilastatin \nare given concomitantly, adequate levels of imipenem (approximately 70 % of the dose) are achieved \nin the urine to enable antibacterial activity.\n\nCilastatin is mainly eliminated in the urine as unchanged parent drug (approximately 70 - 80 % of the\ndose), with 10 % of the dose recovered as an N-acetyl metabolite, which has inhibitory activity against \ndehydropeptidase-I comparable to the parent medicinal product.\n\nRelebactam is cleared primarily via renal excretion as unchanged parent drug (greater than 90 % of the \ndose) and is minimally metabolised. Unchanged relebactam was the only drug-related component \ndetected in human plasma.\n\nElimination\n\nImipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam are mainly excreted by the kidneys.\n\nFollowing multiple-dose administration of 500 mg imipenem, 500 mg cilastatin, and 250 mg \nrelebactam to healthy male subjects, approximately 63 % of the administered imipenem dose, and\n77 % of the administered cilastatin dose are recovered as unchanged parent in the urine. The renal \nexcretion of imipenem and cilastatin involves both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. \nGreater than 90 % of the administered relebactam dose was excreted unchanged in human urine. The \nmean renal clearance for relebactam is 135 mL/min, close to the plasma clearance (148 mL/min), \nindicating nearly complete elimination of relebactam by the renal route. The unbound renal clearance \nof relebactam is greater than the glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that in addition to glomerular \nfiltration, active tubular secretion is involved in the renal elimination, accounting for ~ 30 % of the \ntotal clearance.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of relebactam are linear across the 25 mg to 1150 mg dose range studied for a \nsingle intravenous administration, and 50 mg to 625 mg dose range studied for multiple intravenous \nadministration every 6 hours up to 7 days. Minimal accumulation of imipenem, cilastatin or \nrelebactam was observed following multiple 30 minute intravenous infusions of relebactam (50 to \n625 mg) co-administered with 500 mg imipenem/500 mg cilastatin every 6 hours up to 7 days in \nhealthy adult males with normal renal function.\n\nDrug metabolizing enzymes\n\nStudies evaluating the potential for imipenem or cilastatin to interact with CYP450 enzymes have not \nbeen conducted.\n\nRelebactam at clinically relevant concentrations does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, \nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 in vitro in human liver microsomes. Relebactam showed \nno potential for in vitro induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes. Thus, \nrelebactam is unlikely to cause clinical drug-drug interactions via CYP-mediated pathways.\n\nImipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam are all cleared primarily via renal excretion unchanged, with \nmetabolism as a minor elimination route. Thus, Recarbrio is unlikely to be subject to drug-drug \ninteractions when co-administered with CYP inhibitors or inducers.\n\nMembrane transporters\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nRelebactam does not inhibit the following hepatic and renal transporters in vitro at clinically relevant \nconcentrations: OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MATE2K, or\nBSEP.\n\nRelebactam is actively secreted into the urine. It is not a substrate of OAT1, OCT2, P-gp, BCRP, \nMRP2, or MRP4 transporters, but is a substrate of OAT3, OAT4, MATE1 and MATE2K transporters. \nThe active tubular secretion accounts for only approximately 30 % of the total clearance of \nrelebactam, thus, the extent of drug-drug interaction due to inhibition of the tubular transporters is \nexpected to be of minimal clinical significance, which was confirmed with a clinical drug-drug \ninteraction study with probenecid and Recarbrio (see section 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\n\nIn a clinical pharmacokinetic study and population pharmacokinetic analysis, clinically relevant \ndifferences in exposure (AUC) were observed for imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam based on the \nextent of renal impairment.\n\nIn the clinical study, imipenem geometric mean AUCs were up to 1.4 - fold, 1.5 - fold, and 2.5 - fold \nhigher in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to \nhealthy subjects with normal renal function. The respective cilastatin geometric mean AUCs were up \nto 1.6 - fold, 1.9 - fold, and 5.6 - fold higher. Relebactam geometric mean AUCs were up to 1.6 - fold, \n2.2 - fold, and 4.9 - fold higher in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, \nrespectively, compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function. In subjects with End Stage \nRenal Disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis, imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam are efficiently removed \nby haemodialysis.\n\nTo maintain systemic exposures similar to patients with normal renal function, dose adjustment is \nrecommended for patients with renal impairment. ESRD patients on haemodialysis should receive \nRecarbrio after haemodialysis session (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nImipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam are primarily cleared renally; therefore, hepatic impairment is not \nlikely to have any effect on Recarbrio exposures (see section 4.2).\n\nElderly/gender\n\nIn a geriatric/gender study and population pharmacokinetic analysis no clinically relevant differences \nin exposure (AUC) were observed for imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam based on age or gender, \napart from the effect of renal function (see section 4.2).\n\nRace\n\nOnly a limited number of non-white patients were included in the clinical studies, but no major effect \nof race on imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam pharmacokinetics is expected.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nImipenem/cilastatin\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity studies.\nAnimal studies showed that the toxicity produced by imipenem, as a single entity, was limited to the \nkidney. Co-administration of cilastatin with imipenem in a 1:1 ratio prevented the nephrotoxic effects \n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nof imipenem in rabbits and monkeys. Available evidence suggests that cilastatin prevents the \nnephrotoxicity by preventing entry of imipenem into the tubular cells. \n\nA teratology study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys given imipenem/cilastatin sodium at doses of \n40/40 mg/kg/day (bolus intravenous injection) resulted in maternal toxicity including emesis, \ninappetence, body weight loss, diarrhoea, abortion, and death in some cases. When doses of \nimipenem/cilastatin sodium (approximately 100/100 mg/kg/day or approximately 3 times the \nrecommended daily human intravenous dose) were administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys at \nan intravenous infusion rate which mimics human clinical use, there was minimal maternal intolerance \n(occasional emesis), no maternal deaths, no evidence of teratogenicity, but an increase in embryonic \nloss relative to control groups (see section 4.6).\n\nLong term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of \nimipenem/cilastatin.\n\nRelebactam\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, reproduction toxicity, or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies \nhave not been conducted with relebactam.\n\nRelebactam administered intravenously to lactating rats at a dose of 450 mg/kg/day (GD 6 to LD 14), \nwas excreted into the milk with concentration of approximately 5 % that of maternal plasma \nconcentrations.\n\nAnimal studies show that relebactam given as a single entity caused renal tubular degeneration in \nmonkeys at AUC exposure 7-fold the human AUC exposure at the maximum recommended human \ndose (MRHD). Renal tubular degeneration was shown to be reversible after dose discontinuation.\nThere was no evidence of nephrotoxicity at AUC exposures less than or equal to 3-fold the human \nAUC exposure at the MRHD.\n\n6.

What Recarbrio is and what it is used for\n\nRecarbrio is an antibiotic. It contains the active substances imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam.\n\nRecarbrio is used to kill a wide range of bacteria that cause infections. It is used when there are few or \nno other treatments available.\n\nRecarbrio is used in patients 18 years or older.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Recarbrio\n\nYou should not be given Recarbrio if:\n\uf0b7 you are allergic to imipenem, cilastatin, relebactam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6)\n\uf0b7 you are allergic to carbapenem antibiotics \n\uf0b7 you ever had a severe allergic reaction to penicillin antibiotics or cephalosporin antibiotics\nYou should not be given Recarbrio if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor or nurse before being given Recarbrio.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before being given Recarbrio if:\n\uf0b7 you are allergic to any medicines - especially antibiotics\n\uf0b7 you have ever had convulsions (seizures or fits)\n\uf0b7 you have ever had confusion or muscle twitches with a medicine\n\uf0b7 you are taking a medicine containing valproic acid\n\uf0b7 you have had diarrhoea while taking antibiotics in the past\n\uf0b7 you have kidney problems \u2013 your doctor may lower your dose\n\nTell your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction, convulsions (seizures or fits), diarrhoea, \nor develop kidney problems while receiving Recarbrio (see section 3).\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nChildren and adolescents\nRecarbrio should not be used in children or adolescents who are under 18 years of age. This is because\nit is not known if the medicine is safe to use in these patients.\n\nOther medicines and Recarbrio\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.\n\nTell your doctor about all the medicines you take, especially if you take:\n\uf0b7 medicines that contain ganciclovir, used for treating some viral infections\n\uf0b7 medicines that contain valproic acid or divalproex sodium, usually used for treating epilepsy, \n\nbipolar disorder, or migraine\n\uf0b7 medicines to control blood clotting, such as warfarin\n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding\nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask\nyour doctor for advice before being given this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nRecarbrio may make you feel dizzy, shaky, or cause convulsions or seizures. This may affect your \nability to drive or use machines.\n\nRecarbrio contains sodium\nThis medicine contains approximately 37.5 mg of sodium (main component of cooking/ table salt) in \neach vial. This is equivalent to about 2 % of the adult recommended maximum amount of sodium you \nshould take daily, and needs to be taken into account if you are on a low-salt diet.\n\n3. How you are given Recarbrio\n\nThe usual dose is one vial (containing 500 mg imipenem, 500 mg cilastatin, and 250 mg relebactam) \nevery 6 hours. If you have kidney problems, your doctor may lower your dose.\n\nIt is given as a drip directly into a vein (\u2018intravenous infusion\u2019).
