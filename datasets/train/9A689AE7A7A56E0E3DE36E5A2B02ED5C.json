NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nFasturtec 1.5 mg/ml powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nFasturtec is a recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme produced by genetically modified Saccharomyces \n\ncerevisiae  strain. Rasburicase is a tetrameric protein with identical subunits of a molecular mass of \n\nabout 34 kDa. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml of Fasturtec concentrate contains 1.5 mg rasburicase. \n\n \n\n1 mg corresponds to 18.2 EAU*. \n\n \n\n*One enzyme activity unit (EAU) corresponds to the enzyme activity that converts 1 \u00b5mol of uric acid \n\ninto allantoin per minute under the operating conditions described: +30 \u00b0C \u00b1 1 \u00b0C TEA pH 8.9 buffer. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for sterile concentrate). \n\n \n\nThe powder is an entire or broken white to off white pellet. \n\nThe solvent is a colourless and clear liquid. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1. Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment and prophylaxis of acute hyperuricaemia, in order to prevent acute renal failure, in adults, \n\nchildren and adolescents (aged 0 to 17 years) with haematological malignancy with a high tumour \n\nburden and at risk of a rapid tumour lysis or shrinkage at initiation of chemotherapy. \n\n \n\n4.2. Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nFasturtec is to be used immediately prior to and during the initiation of chemotherapy only, as at the \n\npresent, there is insufficient data to recommend multiple treatment courses. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose for Fasturtec is 0.20 mg/kg/day. Fasturtec is administered as a once daily \n\n30 minute intravenous infusion in 50 ml of a sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution (see section \n\n6.6). \n\n \n\nThe duration of treatment with Fasturtec may be up to 7 days, the exact duration should be based upon \n\nadequate monitoring of uric acid levels in plasma and clinical judgment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAs no adjustment is necessary, the recommended dose is 0.20 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenally or hepatically impaired patients: No dose adjustment is necessary. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of Administration \n\nFasturtec should be administered under the supervision of a physician trained in chemotherapy of \n\nhaematological malignancies. \n\n \n\nAdministration of rasburicase does not require any change in the timing or schedule of initiation of \n\ncytoreductive chemotherapy. \n\nRasburicase solution should be infused over 30 minutes. Rasburicase solution should be infused \n\nthrough a different line than that used for infusion of chemotherapeutic agents to prevent any possible \n\ndrug incompatibility. If use of a separate line is not possible, the line should be flushed out with saline \n\nsolution between infusion of chemotherapeutic agents and rasburicase. For instructions on \n\nreconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nBecause rasburicase may degrade uric acid in vitro, special precautions must be used during sample \n\nhandling for plasma uric acid measurements, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nG6PD deficiency and other cellular metabolic disorders known to cause haemolytic anaemia. \n\nHydrogen peroxide is a by-product of the conversion of uric acid to allantoin. In order to prevent \n\npossible haemolytic anaemia induced by hydrogen peroxide, rasburicase is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith these disorders. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nRasburicase like other proteins, has the potential to induce allergic responses in humans, such as \n\nanaphylaxis, including anaphylactic shock, with potential fatal outcome. Clinical experience with \n\nFasturtec demonstrates that patients should be closely monitored for the onset of allergic-type \n\nundesirable effects, especially severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis (see section \n\n4.8). In case of severe allergic reaction, treatment should immediately and permanently be \n\ndiscontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. \n\n \n\nCaution should be used in patients with a history of atopic allergies. \n\n \n\nAt present, there is insufficient data available on patients being retreated to recommend multiple \n\ntreatment courses. Anti-rasburicase antibodies have been detected in treated patients and healthy \n\nvolunteers administered rasburicase. \n\n \n\nMethaemoglobinaemia has been reported in patients receiving Fasturtec. Fasturtec should immediately \n\nand permanently be discontinued in patients having developed methaemoglobinaemia, and appropriate \n\nmeasures initiated (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nHaemolysis has been reported in patients receiving Fasturtec. In such case, treatment should \n\nimmediately and permanently be discontinued and appropriate measures initiated (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAdministration of Fasturtec reduces the uric acid levels to below normal levels and by this mechanism \n\nreduces the chance of development of renal failure due to precipitation of uric acid crystals in renal \n\ntubules as a consequence of hyperuricaemia. Tumour lysis can also result in hyperphosphataemia, \n\nhyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia. Fasturtec is not directly effective in the treatment of these \n\nabnormalities. Therefore, patients must be monitored closely. \n\n \n\nFasturtec has not been investigated in the patients with hyperuricemia in the context of \n\nmyeloproliferative disorders. \n\n \n\nTo ensure accurate measurement of uric acid plasma level during treatment with Fasturtec, a strict \n\nsample handling procedure must be followed (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. Rasburicase being an enzyme itself, it would be an \n\nunlikely candidate for drug-drug interactions. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data from the use of rasburicase in pregnant women. Results from animal studies could \n\nnot be interpreted due to the presence of endogenous urate oxidase in standard animal models. \n\nBecause teratogenic effects of rasburicase cannot be ruled out, Fasturtec should only be used during \n\npregnancy if strictly necessary.  Fasturtec is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not \n\nusing contraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether rasburicase is excreted in human milk. As a protein the dose for the infant is \n\nexpected to be very low. During treatment with Fasturtec, the advantage of breastfeeding should be \n\nweighted against the potential risk for the infant. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data regarding the effect of rasburicase on fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nFasturtec is concomitantly administered as supportive care to cytoreductive chemotherapy of advanced \n\nmalignancies, the causality of adverse events is therefore difficult to assess due to the significant \n\nburden of adverse events expected from the underlying disease and its treatment. \n\n \n\n The most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, and diarrhea. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, haematological disorders such as haemolysis, haemolytic anaemia and \n\nmethaemoglobinaemia are uncommonly caused by Fasturtec. The enzymatic digestion of uric acid to \n\nallantoin by rasburicase produces hydrogen peroxide and haemolytic anaemia or \n\nmethaemoglobinaemia have been observed in certain at risk populations such as those with G6PD \n\ndeficiency. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions possibly attributable to Fasturtec and reported in the clinical trials, are listed below, \n\nby system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined using the following MedDRA \n\nconvention as: very common (\uf0b31/10); common (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100), \n\nrare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nMedDRA \n\nOrgan system \n\nclasses \n\nVery \n\ncommon \n\n \n\nCommon \n\n \n\nUncommon \n\n \n\nRare Not known \n\nBlood and \n\nlymphatic \n\nsystem \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\n  - Haemolysis \n\n- Haemolytic \n\nanaemia  \n\n- \n\nMethaemoglobina\n\nemia \n\n  \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n - Allergy/ \n\nallergic \n\nreactions \n\n(rashes and \n\nurticaria) \n\n- Severe \n\nhypersensitivity \n\nreactions \n\n- Anaphylaxis - Anaphylactic \n\nshock* \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\n- Headache + \n\n \n\n - Convulsion** \n \n\n - Muscle \ncontraction \n\ninvoluntary** \n\nVascular \n\ndisorders \n\n  - Hypotension   \n\nRespiratory, \n\nthoracic and \n\nmediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\n  - Bronchospasm - Rhinitis \n \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\n \n\n- Diarrhoea + \n\n- Vomiting++ \n\n- Nausea++ \n\n \n\n    \n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministration \n\nsite conditions \n\n \n\n- Fever++ \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n* Anaphylactic shock including potential fatal outcome  \n\n** From post-marketing experience \n\n+ Uncommon G3/4 \n\n++ Common G3/4 \n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn view of the mechanism of action of Fasturtec, an overdose will lead to low or undetectable plasma \n\nuric acid concentrations and increased production of hydrogen peroxide. Thus patients suspected of \n\nreceiving an overdose should be monitored for haemolysis, and general supportive measures should be \n\ninitiated as no specific antidote for Fasturtec has been identified. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Detoxifying agents for antineoplastic treatment, ATC code: V03AF07. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nIn humans, uric acid is the final step in the catabolic pathway of purines. The acute increase in plasma \n\nlevels of uric acid subsequent to the lysis of large numbers of malignant cells and during cytoreductive \n\nchemotherapy may lead to impairment of renal function and renal failure resulting from the \n\nprecipitation of crystals of uric acid in renal tubules. Rasburicase is a highly potent uricolytic agent \n\nthat catalyses enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into allantoin, a water soluble product, easily excreted \n\nby the kidneys in the urine. \n\nThe enzymatic oxidation of uric acid leads to stoichiometric formation of hydrogen peroxide. The \n\nincreased of hydrogen peroxide over ambient levels can be eliminated by endogenous antioxidants and \n\nthe only increased risk is for haemolysis in G6PD deficient and inherited anaemia patients. \n\n \n\nIn healthy volunteers, a marked dose-related decrease in plasma uric acid levels was observed across \n\nthe dose range 0.05 mg/kg to 0.20 mg/kg of Fasturtec. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nIn a randomised comparative phase III study, performed in 52 paediatric patients, 27 patients were \n\ntreated with rasburicase at the recommended dose of 0.20 mg/kg/day, intravenously, for 4 to 7 days \n\n(< 5 years: n=11; 6-12 years: n=11; 13-17 years: n=5), and 25 patients with allopurinol daily oral \n\ndoses for 4 to 8 days. Results showed a significantly more rapid onset of action of Fasturtec in \n\ncomparison with allopurinol. At 4 hours post first dose, there was a significant difference in the mean \n\npercentage change from baseline plasma uric acid concentration (p <0.0001) in the Fasturtec group (-\n\n86.0%) compared to that for the allopurinol group (-12.1%). \n\n \n\nTime to first confirmation of normal levels of uric acid in hyperuricaemic patients is four hours for \n\nFasturtec and 24 hours for allopurinol. In addition this rapid control of uric acid in this population is \n\naccompanied by improvements in renal function. In turn, this allows efficient excretion of the serum \n\nphosphate load preventing further deterioration of renal function from calcium/phosphorus \n\nprecipitation. \n\n \n\nIn a randomized (1:1:1), multi-center, open-label study, 275 adult patients with leukemia and \n\nlymphoma at risk for hyperuricemia and tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) were treated with either \n\nrasburicase at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day, intravenously, for 5 days (arm A: n=92), rasburicase at a dose \n\nof 0.2 mg/kg/day, intravenously, from day 1 through day 3 followed by oral allopurinol at a dose of \n\n300 mg once a day from day 3 through day 5 (overlap on day 3: rasburicase and allopurinol \n\nadministered approximately 12 hours apart) (arm B: n=92), or oral allopurinol at a dose of 300 mg \n\nonce a day for 5 days (arm C: n=91). The uric acid response rate (proportion of patients with plasma \n\nuric acid levels \u22647.5 mg/dl from day 3 to day 7 after initiation of antihyperuricemic treatment) was \n\n87% in arm A, 78% in arm B, and 66% in arm C. The response rate in arm A was significantly greater \n\nthan in arm C (p=0.0009); the response rate was higher for arm B compared to arm C although this \n\ndifference was not statistically significant. Uric acid levels were <2 mg/dl in 96% of patients in the \n\ntwo arms containing rasburicase and 5% of patients in the allopurinol arm at 4 hours of the day 1 dose. \n\nThe safety results of patients treated with Fasturtec in Study EFC4978 were consistent with the \n\nadverse events profile observed in previous clinical studies with predominantly paediatric patients. \n\n \n\nIn pivotal clinical studies, 246 paediatric patients ( mean age 7 years, range 0 to17) were treated with \n\nrasburicase at doses of 0.15 mg/kg/day or 0.20 mg/kg/day for 1 to 8 days (mainly 5 to 7 days). \n\nEfficacy results on 229 evaluable patients showed an overall response rate (normalization of plasma \n\nuric acid levels) of 96.1%. Safety results on 246 patients were consistent with the adverse events \n\nprofile in the overall population. \n\nIn long term safety studies, an analysis of data from 867 paediatric patients (mean age 7.3 years, range \n\n0 to17) treated with rasburicase at 0.20 mg/kg/day for 1 to 24 days (mainly 1 to 4 days) showed \n\n\n\n7 \n\nconsistent findings with pivotal clinical studies in terms of efficacy and safety. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of rasburicase were evaluated in both paediatric and adult patients with \n\nleukaemia, lymphoma or other haematological malignancies.  \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter infusion of rasburicase at a dose of 0.20 mg/kg/day, steady state is achieved at day 2 - 3. \n\nMinimal accumulation of rasburicase (<1.3 fold) was observed between days 1 and 5 of dosing. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe mean volume of distribution ranged from 110 - 127 ml/kg in paediatric patients and from 75.8 to \n\n138 ml/kg in adult patients, respectively, which is comparable to the physiological vascular volume. \n\n \n\nMetabolism \n\nRasburicase is a protein, and therefore: 1) not expected to bind to proteins, 2) expected that metabolic \n\ndegradation will follow the pathways of other proteins, i.e. peptide hydrolysis, 3) unlikely to be \n\ncandidate for drug-drug interactions.  \n\n \n\nElimination  \n\nClearance of rasburicase was ca. 3.5 ml/h/kg. The mean terminal half-life was similar between \n\npaediatric and adult patients and ranged from 15.7 to 22.5 hours. Clearance is increased (ca. 35%) in \n\nchildren and adolescents compared to adults, resulting in a lower systemic exposure. Renal elimination \n\nof rasburicase is considered to be a minor pathway for rasburicase clearance. \n\n \n\nSpecial patient populations  \n\nIn adults (\u2265 the age of 18 years), age, gender, baseline liver enzymes and creatinine clearance did not \n\nimpact the pharmacokinetics of rasburicase. A cross-study comparison revealed that after \n\nadministration of rasburicase at 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg, the geometric mean values of body-weight \n\nnormalized clearance were approximately 40% lower in Japanese (n=20) than that in Caucasians \n\n(n=26).  \n\n \n\nAs metabolism is expected to occur by peptide hydrolysis, an impaired liver function is not expected \n\nto affect the pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. The interpretation of the non-clinical studies is \n\nhampered due to the presence of endogenous urate oxidase in standard animal models. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n\n \n\nPowder: \n\nalanine \n\nmannitol \n\ndisodium phosphate dodecahydrate \n\ndisodium phosphate dihydrate \n\nsodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate \n\n \n\nSolvent: \n\npoloxamer 188 \n\nwater for injection \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \n\nsection 6.6. \n\nRasburicase solution should be infused through a different line than that used for infusion of \n\nchemotherapeutic agents to prevent any possible drug incompatibility. If use of a separate line is not \n\npossible, the line should be flushed out with saline solution between chemotherapeutic agent infusions \n\nand rasburicase. \n\nNo filter should be used for infusion. \n\nDo not use any glucose solution for dilution due to potential incompatibility. \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n\n \n\n3 years. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution or dilution an immediate use is recommended. However, the in-use stability has \n\nbeen demonstrated for 24 hours between +2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nPowder in vial: store in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \n\nDo not freeze. \n\nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution or dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \n\nFasturtec is supplied as a pack of: \n\n \n\n3 vials of 1.5 mg rasburicase and 3 ampoules of 1 ml solvent. The powder is supplied in 3 ml clear \n\nglass (type I) vial with a rubber stopper and the solvent in a 2 ml clear glass (type I) ampoule. \n\n \n\n1 vial of 7.5 mg rasburicase and 1 ampoule of 5 ml solvent. The powder is supplied in 10 ml clear \n\nglass (type I) vial with a rubber stopper and the solvent in a 5 ml clear glass (type I) ampoule. \n\n \n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n \n\nRasburicase must be reconstituted with the entire volume of the supplied solvent ampoule (1.5 mg \n\nrasburicase vial to be reconstituted with the 1 ml solvent ampoule; 7.5 mg rasburicase vial to be \n\nreconstituted with the 5 ml solvent ampoule). Reconstitution results in a solution with a concentration \n\nof 1.5 mg/ml rasburicase to be further diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) intravenous \n\nsolution. \n\n \n\nReconstitution of the solution: \n\nAdd the content of one ampoule of solvent to one vial containing rasburicase and mix by swirling very \n\ngently under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\nDo not shake. \n\nInspect visually prior to use. Only clear and colourless solutions without particles should be used. \n\nFor single-use only, any unused solution should be discarded. \n\nThe solvent contains no preservative. Therefore the reconstituted solution should be diluted under \n\ncontrolled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nDilution before infusion: \n\nThe required volume of the reconstituted solution depends on the patient's body weight. The use of \n\nseveral vials may be necessary to obtain the quantity of rasburicase required for one administration. \n\nThe required volume of the reconstituted solution, taken from one or more vials, is to be further \n\ndiluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution to make a total volume of 50 ml. The \n\nconcentration of rasburicase in the final solution for infusion depends on the patient's body weight. \n\n \n\nThe reconstituted solution contains no preservative. Therefore the diluted solution should be infused \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nInfusion: \n\nThe final solution should be infused over 30 minutes. \n\n \n\nSample handling: \n\nIf it is necessary to monitor a patient\u2019s uric acid level, a strict sample-handling procedure must be \n\nfollowed to minimise ex vivo degradation of the analyte. Blood must be collected into pre-chilled tubes \n\ncontaining heparin anticoagulant. Samples must be immersed in an ice/water bath. Plasma samples \n\nshould immediately be prepared by centrifugation in a pre-cooled centrifuge (4\u00b0C). Finally, plasma \n\nmust be maintained in an ice/water bath and analysed for uric acid within 4 hours. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist. \n\n- If you get any side effects, please talk to your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist. This includes \n\nany possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Fasturtec is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Fasturtec \n\n3. How to use Fasturtec \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Fasturtec \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Fasturtec is and what it is used for  \n\n \n\nFasturtec contains the active ingredient rasburicase. \n\nRasburicase is used to treat or prevent high blood levels of uric acid from occurring in adults, children \n\nand adolescents (aged 0 to 17 years) with disorders of the blood cells (haematological diseases) who \n\nare about to receive or are receiving chemotherapy treatment.  \n\n \n\nWhen chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, releasing large amounts of uric acid into the \n\nbloodstream.  \n\nFasturtec works by allowing uric acid to more easily be removed from the body by the kidneys.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Fasturtec \n\n \n\nDo not use Fasturtec if you: \n\n- are allergic (hypersensitive) to rasburicase, other uricases or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- have a history of haemolytic anaemia (an illness caused by red blood cells being abnormally \n\nbroken down).  \n\n \n\nWarning and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist if you have a history of any kind of allergy. \n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had any allergic type reactions due to other medicines; Fasturtec can \n\ncause allergic-type reactions, such as severe anaphylaxis including anaphylactic shock (sudden life-\n\nthreatening or fatal allergic reactions).  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following as you may need to stop treatment: \n\n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat \n\u2022 coughing or wheezing \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing or swallowing \n\u2022 rash, itching or hives (nettle-type rash) on the skin \n\n \n\nThese may be the first signs that a severe allergic reaction is happening. Your treatment with \n\nFasturtec may need to be stopped, and you may need further treatment. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether the chance of developing an allergic reaction is increased if treatment with \n\nFasturtec is repeated. \n\n \n\nIn case of disorders of the blood in which red blood cells are abnormally broken down (haemolysis) or \n\nabnormal blood pigment levels (methaemoglobinaemia), your doctor will immediately and \n\npermanently discontinue treatment with Fasturtec. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Fasturtec  \n\nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines, including \n\nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nTell your doctor if you are, or think you may be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nNo information on the ability to drive and use machines is available. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Fasturtec  \n\n \n\nFasturtec is to be given to you before or during the start of your course of chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nFasturtec is injected slowly into a vein, which should take about 30 minutes. \n\n \n\nYour dose will be calculated according to your body weight.  \n\nThe recommended dose is 0.20 mg per kg of body weight per day in both children and adults. \n\n \n\nIt will be given once a day, for up to 7 days.  \n\nDuring treatment with Fasturtec, your doctor will carry out blood tests to check the levels of uric acid \n\nand decide how long you will be treated for.  \n\nYour doctor may also test your blood to make sure that you do not develop any blood disorders. \n\n \n\nIf you are given more Fasturtec than you should be \n\nIf it does occur, the doctor will closely monitor the effects on your red blood cells and treat any \n\nsymptoms that follow. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or hospital \n\npharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n\nFasturtec will be administered at the same time as other medicines that may also cause side effects.  \n\n \n\nIf you suddenly notice: \n\n- a swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other part of your body \n\n- a shortness of breath, wheezing or breathing problems  \n\n- a rash, itching or hives  \n\nTell your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist immediately as these may be signs of a serious \n\nallergic reaction (anaphylaxis). These are rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n- diarrhoea \n\n- vomiting \n\n- nausea \n\n\n\n28 \n\n- headache \n\n- fever \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n- allergic reactions, mainly rashes and urticaria. \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n- severe hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis (rare) including anaphylactic shock \n\n(frequency not known) which may be fatal \n\n- low blood pressure (hypotension) \n\n- wheezing or difficulty in breathing (bronchospasm) \n\n- blood disorders such as a disorder of the blood in which red blood cells are abnormally broken \n\ndown (haemolysis), destroyed (haemolytic anaemia), or abnormal blood pigment levels \n\n(methaemoglobinaemia)  \n\n-  fits (convulsion).  \n\n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\n- runny or blocked nose, sneezing, facial pressure or pain (rhinitis). \n\n \n\nFrequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n- involuntary muscle movements (muscle contraction involuntary). \n \n\nIf you notice any of these, tell your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

Reconstitution results in a solution with a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml to be \n\nfurther diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%). \n\n \n\nReconstitution of the solution:  \n\nAdd the content of one ampoule of solvent to one vial containing rasburicase and mix by swirling very \n\ngently under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.  \n\nDo not shake.  \n\nInspect visually prior to use. Only clear and colourless solutions without particles should be used. \n\nFor single-use only, any unused solution should be discarded. \n\nThe solvent contains no preservative. Therefore the reconstituted solution should be diluted under \n\ncontrolled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\nDilution before infusion: \n\nThe required volume of the reconstituted solution depends on the patient's body weight. The use of \n\nseveral vials may be necessary to obtain the quantity of rasburicase required for one administration. \n\nThe required volume of the reconstituted solution, taken from one or more vials, is to be further \n\ndiluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution to make a total volume of 50 ml. The \n\nconcentration of rasburicase in the final solution for infusion depends on the patient's body weight.  \n\n \n\nThe reconstituted solution contains no preservative. Therefore the diluted solution should be infused \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nInfusion: \n\nThe final solution should be infused over 30 minutes. \n\n \n\nSample handling: \n\nIf it is necessary to monitor a patient\u2019s uric acid level, a strict sample-handling procedure must be \n\nfollowed to minimise ex vivo degradation of the analyte. Blood must be collected into pre-chilled tubes \n\ncontaining heparin anticoagulant. Samples must be immersed in an ice/water bath. Plasma samples \n\nshould immediately be prepared by centrifugation in a pre-cooled centrifuge (4\u00b0C). Finally, plasma \n\nmust be maintained in an ice/water bath and analysed for uric acid within 4 hours. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
