NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCotellic 20 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains cobimetinib hemifumarate equivalent to 20 mg cobimetinib. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 36 mg lactose monohydrate.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet.  \n \nWhite, round film-coated tablets of approximately 6.6 mm diameter, with “COB” debossed on one \nside. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCotellic is indicated for use in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib should only be initiated and supervised by a \nqualified physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products.  \n \nBefore starting this treatment, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma tumour \nstatus confirmed by a validated test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Cotellic is 60 mg (3 tablets of 20 mg) once daily.  \n \nCotellic is taken on a 28 day cycle. Each dose consists of three 20 mg tablets (60 mg) and should be \ntaken once daily for 21 consecutive days (Days 1 to 21-treatment period); followed by a 7-day break \n(Days 22 to 28-treatment break). Each subsequent Cotellic treatment cycle should start after the 7-day \ntreatment break has elapsed.  \n \nFor information on the posology of vemurafenib, please refer to its SmPC. \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nTreatment with Cotellic should continue until the patient no longer derives benefit or until the \ndevelopment of unacceptable toxicity (see Table 1 below). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMissed doses  \n \nIf a dose is missed, it can be taken up to 12 hours prior to the next dose to maintain the once-daily \nregimen. \n \nVomiting \n \nIn case of vomiting after administration of Cotellic, the patient should not take an additional dose on \nthat day and treatment should be continued as prescribed the following day.  \n \nGeneral dose modifications \n \nThe decision on whether to reduce the dose for either or both treatments should be based on the \nprescriber’s assessment of individual patient safety or tolerability. Dose modification of Cotellic is \nindependent of vemurafenib dose modification.  \n \nIf doses are omitted for toxicity, these doses should not be replaced. Once the dose has been reduced, \nit should not be increased at a later time. \n \nTable 1 below gives general Cotellic dose modification guidance. \n \nTable 1 Recommended Cotellic dose modifications    \n \n\nGrade (CTC-AE)* Recommended Cotellic dose \n\nGrade 1 or Grade 2 (tolerable)  No dose reduction. Maintain Cotellic at a dose of \n60 mg once daily (3 tablets) \n\nGrade 2 (intolerable) or Grade 3/4  \n\n1st Appearance Interrupt treatment until Grade ≤ 1, restart treatment \nat 40 mg once daily (2 tablets) \n\n2nd Appearance Interrupt treatment until Grade ≤ 1, restart treatment \nat 20 mg once daily (1 tablet) \n\n3rd Appearance Consider permanent discontinuation \n*The intensity of clinical adverse events graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 \n(CTC-AE) \n \nDose modification advice for haemorrhage \n \nGrade 4 events or cerebral haemorrhage: Cotellic treatment should be interrupted. Cotellic treatment \nshould be permanently discontinued for haemorrhage events attributed to Cotellic. \n \nGrade 3 events: Cotellic treatment should be interrupted during evaluation to avoid any potential \ncontribution to the event. There is no data on the effectiveness of Cotellic dose modification for \nhaemorrhage events. Clinical judgment should be applied when considering restarting Cotellic \ntreatment. Vemurafenib dosing can be continued when Cotellic treatment is interrupted, if clinically \nindicated. \n \nDose modification advice for left ventricular dysfunction \n \nPermanent discontinuation of Cotellic treatment should be considered if cardiac symptoms are \nattributed to Cotellic and do not improve after temporary interruption. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2 Recommended dose modifications for Cotellic in patients with left ventricular ejection \nfraction (LVEF) decrease from baseline \n \n\nPatient LVEF value \n\nRecommended \nCotellic dose \nmodification \n\nLVEF value \nfollowing \n\ntreatment break \n\nRecommended Cotellic \ndaily dose \n\nAsymptomatic \n\n≥ 50%  \n(or 40-49% \nand < 10% \n\nabsolute \ndecrease \n\nfrom \nbaseline) \n\nContinue at \ncurrent dose N/A N/A \n\n< 40%  \n(or 40-49% \nand ≥ 10% \n\nabsolute \ndecrease \n\nfrom \nbaseline)  \n\nInterrupt \ntreatment for \n\n2 weeks \n\n< 10% absolute \ndecrease from \n\nbaseline \n\n1st occurrence: 40 mg \n\n2nd occurrence: 20 mg \n3rd occurrence:  \npermanent discontinuation \n\n< 40%  \n(or ≥ 10% absolute \n\ndecrease from \nbaseline) \n\nPermanent discontinuation \n\nSymptomatic N/A \nInterrupt \n\ntreatment for \n4 weeks \n\nAsymptomatic and \n< 10% absolute \ndecrease from \n\nbaseline \n\n1st occurrence: 40 mg \n\n2nd occurrence: 20 mg \n3rd occurrence:  \npermanent discontinuation \n\nAsymptomatic and \n< 40%  \n\n(or ≥ 10% absolute \ndecrease from \n\nbaseline) \n\nPermanent discontinuation \n\nSymptomatic \nregardless of LVEF Permanent discontinuation \n\nN/A = Not Applicable \n \nVemurafenib treatment can be continued when Cotellic treatment is modified, if clinically indicated. \n \nDose modification advice for rhabdomyolysis and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations \n \nRhabdomyolysis or symptomatic CPK elevations  \n \nCotellic treatment should be interrupted. If rhabdomyolysis or symptomatic CPK elevations do not \nimprove within 4 weeks, Cotellic treatment should be permanently discontinued. \nIf severity is improved by at least one grade within 4 weeks, Cotellic could be restarted at a dose \nreduced by 20 mg, if clinically indicated.  Patients should be closely monitored. Vemurafenib dosing \ncan be continued when Cotellic treatment is modified.  \n \nAsymptomatic CPK elevations \n \nGrade 4: Cotellic treatment should be interrupted.  If CPK elevations do not improve to Grade ≤3 \nwithin 4 weeks following dose interruption, Cotellic treatment should be permanently discontinued. \nIf CPK improves to Grade ≤3 within 4 weeks, Cotellic could be restarted, if clinically indicated, at a \ndose reduced by 20 mg and the patient should be closely monitored.  Vemurafenib dosing can be \ncontinued when Cotellic treatment is modified.  \n \nGrade ≤3: After rhabdomyolysis has been ruled out, Cotellic dosing does not need to be modified.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nDose modification advice for Cotellic when used with vemurafenib \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities \n \nFor Grade 1 and 2 liver laboratory abnormalities, Cotellic and vemurafenib should be continued at the \nprescribed dose. \n \nGrade 3: Cotellic should be continued at the prescribed dose. The dose of vemurafenib may be \nreduced as clinically appropriate.  Please refer to the vemurafenib SmPC. \n \nGrade 4: Cotellic treatment and vemurafenib treatment should be interrupted. If liver laboratory \nabnormalities improve to Grade ≤1 within 4 weeks, Cotellic should be restarted at a dose reduced by \n20 mg and vemurafenib at a clinically appropriate dose, per its SmPC.   \n \nCotellic treatment and vemurafenib treatment should be discontinued if liver laboratory abnormalities \ndo not resolve to Grade ≤1 within 4 weeks or if Grade 4 liver laboratory abnormalities recur after \ninitial improvement. \n \nPhotosensitivity \n \nGrade ≤2 (tolerable) photosensitivity should be managed with supportive care.   \n \nGrade 2 (intolerable) or Grade ≥3 photosensitivity: Cotellic and vemurafenib should be interrupted \nuntil resolution to Grade ≤1. Treatment can be restarted with no change in Cotellic dose. Vemurafenib \ndosing should be reduced as clinically appropriate, please refer to its SmPC for further information.  \n \nRash \n \nRash events may occur with either Cotellic or vemurafenib treatment. The dose of Cotellic and/or \nvemurafenib may be either temporarily interrupted and/or reduced as clinically indicated.   \nAdditionally, for: \n \nGrade ≤2 (tolerable) rash should be managed with supportive care. Cotellic dosing can be continued \nwithout modification. \n \nGrade 2 (intolerable) or Grade ≥3 acneiform rash: General dose modification recommendations in \nTable 1 for Cotellic should be followed. Vemurafenib dosing can be continued when Cotellic \ntreatment is modified (if clinically indicated).  \n \nGrade 2 (intolerable) or Grade ≥3 non-acneiform or maculopapular rash: Cotellic dosing can be \ncontinued without modification if clinically indicated. Vemurafenib dosing may be either temporarily \ninterrupted and/or reduced, please refer to its SmPC for further information. \n \nQT prolongation \n \nIf during treatment the QTc exceeds 500 msec, please refer to the vemurafenib SmPC (section 4.2) for \ndose modifications for vemurafenib. No dose modification of Cotellic is required when taken in \ncombination with vemurafenib. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients aged ≥65 years old. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment based on \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis (see section 5.2). There are minimal data for Cotellic in patients \nwith severe renal impairment, therefore an effect cannot be excluded. Cotellic should be used with \ncaution in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment may have increased plasma concentrations of unbound cobimetinib compared to patients \nwith normal hepatic function (see section 5.2). Liver laboratory abnormalities can occur with Cotellic \nand caution should be used in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nNon-Caucasian patients \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Cotellic in non-Caucasian patients have not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Cotellic in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nCotellic is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. They can be taken with or \nwithout food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBefore taking Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-\npositive tumour status confirmed by a validated test. \n  \nCotellic in combination with vemurafenib in patients who have progressed on a BRAF inhibitor \n \nThere are limited data in patients taking the combination of Cotellic with vemurafenib who have \nprogressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor. These data show that the efficacy of the combination will be \nlower in these patients (see section 5.1). Therefore other treatment options should be considered before \ntreatment with the combination in this prior BRAF inhibitor treated population. The sequencing of \ntreatments following progression on a BRAF inhibitor therapy has not been established. \n \nCotellic in combination with vemurafenib in patients with brain metastases \n \nThe safety and efficacy of the combination of Cotellic and vemurafenib have not been evaluated in \npatients with a BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma which has metastasised to the brain. The \nintracranial activity of cobimetinib is currently unknown (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nHaemorrhagic events, including major haemorrhagic events can occur (see section 4.8).  \n \nCaution should be used in patients with additional risk factors for bleeding, such as brain metastases, \nand/or in patients that use concomitant medicinal products that increase the risk of bleeding (including \nantiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy). For management of haemorrhage please see section 4.2. \n \nSerous retinopathy  \n \nSerous retinopathy (fluid accumulation within the layers of the retina) has been observed in patients \ntreated with MEK-inhibitors, including Cotellic (see section 4.8). The majority of events were reported \nas chorioretinopathy or retinal detachment. \n \nMedian time to initial onset of serous retinopathy events was 1 month (range 0-9 months). Most events \nobserved in clinical studies were resolved, or improved to asymptomatic Grade 1, following dose \ninterruption or reduction. \n \nPatients should be assessed at each visit for symptoms of new or worsening visual disturbances. If \nsymptoms of new or worsening visual disturbances are identified, an ophthalmologic examination is \nrecommended. If serous retinopathy is diagnosed, Cotellic treatment should be withheld until visual \nsymptoms improve to Grade ≤1. Serous retinopathy can be managed with treatment interruption, dose \nreduction or with treatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in section 4.2). \n \nLeft ventricular dysfunction  \n \nDecrease in LVEF from baseline has been reported in patients receiving Cotellic (see section 4.8).  \nMedian time to initial onset of events was 4 months (1-13 months).   \n \nLVEF should be evaluated before initiation of treatment to establish baseline values, then after the first \nmonth of treatment and at least every 3 months or as clinically indicated until treatment \ndiscontinuation.  Decrease in LVEF from baseline can be managed using treatment interruption, dose \nreduction or with treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2). \n \nAll patients restarting treatment with a dose reduction of Cotellic should have LVEF measurements \ntaken after approximately 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 10 weeks and 16 weeks, and then as clinically indicated. \n \nPatients with a baseline LVEF either below institutional lower limit of normal (LLN) or below 50% \nhave not been studied. \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities can occur when Cotellic is used in combination with vemurafenib and \nwith vemurafenib as a single agent (please refer to its SmPC). \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities, specifically increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), have been observed in patients treated with \nCotellic plus vemurafenib (see section 4.8).  \n \nLiver value abnormalities should be monitored by liver laboratory tests before initiation of \ncombination treatment and monthly during treatment, or more frequently as clinically indicated (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nGrade 3 liver laboratory abnormalities should be managed with vemurafenib treatment interruption or \ndose reduction. Manage Grade 4 liver laboratory abnormalities with treatment interruption, dose \nreduction or with treatment discontinuation of both Cotellic and vemurafenib (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nRhabdomyolysis and CPK elevations \n  \nRhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients receiving Cotellic (see section 4.8).  \n \nIf rhabdomyolysis is diagnosed, Cotellic treatment should be interrupted and CPK levels and other \nsymptoms monitored until resolution. Depending on the severity of rhabdomyolysis, dose reduction or \ntreatment discontinuation may be required (see section 4.2).  \n \nGrade 3 and 4 CPK elevations, including asymptomatic elevations over baseline, also occurred in \npatients receiving Cotellic with vemurafenib in clinical studies(see section 4.8). The median time to \nfirst occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevations was 16 days (range: 11 days to 10 months); the \nmedian time to complete resolution was 16 days (range: 2 days to 15 months).   \n \nSerum CPK and creatinine levels should be measured before initiation of treatment, to establish \nbaseline values, and then monitored monthly during treatment, or as clinically indicated. If serum CPK \nis elevated, check for signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis or other causes. Depending on the \nseverity of symptoms or CPK elevation; treatment interruption, dose reduction or treatment \ndiscontinuation may be required (see section 4.2). \n \nDiarrhoea \n \nCases of Grade ≥3 and serious diarrhoea have been reported in patients treated with Cotellic. \nDiarrhoea should be managed with anti-diarrhoeal agents and supportive care. For Grade ≥3 diarrhoea \nthat occurs despite supportive care, Cotellic and vemurafenib should be withheld until diarrhoea has \nimproved to Grade ≤1. If Grade ≥3 diarrhoea recurs, the dose of Cotellic and vemurafenib should be \nreduced (see section 4.2).  \n \nDrug-drug interactions: CYP3A inhibitors \n \nConcurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with Cotellic should be avoided. Caution \nshould be exercised if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor is co-administered with Cotellic. If concomitant \nuse with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored \nfor safety and dose modifications applied if clinically indicated (see Table 1 in section 4.2).  \n \nQT prolongation \n \nIf during treatment the QTc exceeds 500 msec, please refer to the vemurafenib SmPC sections 4.2 and \n4.4. \n \nExcipients  \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.   \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on cobimetinib \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \n \nCobimetinib is metabolized by CYP3A and cobimetinib AUC increased approximately 7 fold in the \npresence of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) in healthy subjects. The magnitude of interaction \ncould potentially be lower in patients.  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nStrong CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.4.)  \n \nAvoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with cobimetinib. Strong CYP3A \ninhibitors include, but are not limited to ritonavir, cobicistat, telaprevir, lopinavir, itraconazole, \nvoriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, posaconazole, nefazodone and grapefruit juice. If \nconcomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored \nfor safety. For strong CYP3A inhibitors used short-term (7 days or less), consider interrupting \ncobimetinib therapy during the duration of inhibitor use. \n \nModerate CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.4.)  \n \nCaution should be exercised if cobimetinib is co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. \nModerate CYP3A inhibitors include, but are not limited to, amiodarone, erythromycin, fluconazole, \nmiconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, delavirdine, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, imatinib. When \ncobimetinib is co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, patients should be carefully \nmonitored for safety.  \n \nMild CYP3A inhibitors  \n \nCobimetinib can be co-administered with mild inhibitors of CYP3A without dose adjustment. \n \nCYP3A inducers \n \nCo-administration of cobimetinib with a strong CYP3A inducer was not assessed in a clinical study, \nhowever, a reduction in cobimetinib exposure is likely. Therefore, concomitant use of moderate and \nstrong CYP3A inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort) should be \navoided. Alternative agents with no or minimal CYP3A induction should be considered. Given that \ncobimetinib concentrations are likely to be significantly reduced when co-administered with moderate \nto strong CYP3A inducers, patient’s efficacy may be compromised. \n \nP-glycoprotein inhibitors \n \nCobimetinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors \nsuch as ciclosporin and verapamil may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of \ncobimetinib. \n \nEffects of cobimetinib on other medicinal products   \n \nCYP3A and CYP2D6 substrates \n \nA clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in cancer patients showed that plasma concentrations of \nmidazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) and dextromethorphan (a sensitive CYP2D6 substrate) were \nnot altered in the presence of cobimetinib. \n  \nCYP1A2 substrates \n \nIn vitro, cobimetinib is a potential inducer of CYP1A2 and may therefore reduce the exposure of \nsubstrates of this enzyme e.g., theophylline. No clinical DDI studies have been conducted to assess the \nclinical relevance of this finding. \n \nBCRP substrates \n \nIn vitro, cobimetinib is a moderate inhibitor of BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein). No clinical \nDDI studies have been conducted to assess this finding, and clinically relevant inhibition of intestinal \nBCRP cannot be ruled out. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nOther anti-cancer agents \n \nVemurafenib \n \nThere is no evidence of any clinically significant drug-drug interaction between cobimetinib and \nvemurafenib in unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients and therefore no dose adjustments is \nrecommended. \n \nEffects of cobimetinib on drug transport systems \n \nIn vitro studies show that cobimetinib is not a substrate of the liver uptake transporters OATP1B1, \nOATP1B3 and OCT1, however, it weakly inhibits these transporters. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings has not been investigated.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use two effective contraceptive methods, such \nas a condom or other barrier method (with spermicide, if available) during treatment with Cotellic and \nfor at least three months following treatment discontinuation.  \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of Cotellic in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nembryolethality and foetal malformations of the great vessels and skull (see section 5.3). Cotellic \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after a careful consideration of the \nneeds of the mother and the risk to the foetus.   \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether cobimetinib is excreted in human breast milk. A risk to the newborns/infants \ncannot be excluded. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue \nCotellic therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data in humans for cobimetinib. In animals, no fertility studies have been performed, but \nadverse effects were seen on reproductive organs (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of this is \nunknown.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCotellic has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Visual disturbances have been \nreported in some patients treated with cobimetinib during clinical studies (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \nPatients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience visual disturbances or any \nother adverse effects that may affect their ability.  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib has been evaluated in 247 patients with \nadvanced BRAF V600 mutated melanoma in Study GO28141.The median time to onset for the first \nGrade ≥3 adverse events was 0.6 months in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm vs 0.8 months in the \nplacebo plus vemurafenib arm.  \n \nThe safety of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib has also been evaluated in 129 patients with \nadvanced BRAF V600 mutated melanoma in Study NO25395.  The safety profile of Study NO25395 \nwas consistent with that observed in Study GO28141. \n \nIn Study GO28141, the most common adverse reactions (>20%) observed with a higher frequency in \nthe Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm were diarrhoea, rash, nausea, pyrexia, photosensitivity reaction, \nincreased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased blood creatine \nphosphokinase, and vomiting. The most common adverse reactions (>20%) observed with a higher \nfrequency in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm were arthralgia, alopecia, and hyperkeratosis. Fatigue \nwas observed at similar frequencies in both arms. \n \nPlease refer to the vemurafenib SmPC for complete descriptions of all undesirable effects associated \nwith vemurafenib treatment.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) are based on results from a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, Phase III Study (GO28141) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Cotellic in \ncombination with vemurafenib as compared to vemurafenib alone in previously untreated BRAF V600 \nmutation-positive patients with unresectable locally advanced (Stage IIIc) or metastatic melanoma \n(Stage IV). \n \nADR frequencies are based upon the safety analysis of patients treated with cobimetinib plus \nvemurafenib with a median follow up of 11.2 months (data cut-off date of 19 September 2014). \n \nADRs which were reported in melanoma patients are listed below by MedDRA body system organ \nclass, frequency and grade of severity. The following convention has been used for the classification \nof frequency: \nVery common ≥ 1/10 \nCommon ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \nUncommon ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \nRare ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000  \nVery rare < 1/10,000 \n \nTable 3 lists adverse reactions considered associated with the use of Cotellic. Within each frequency \ngrouping, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing severity and were reported according to NCI-\nCTCAE v 4.0 (common toxicity criteria) for assessment of toxicity in Study GO28141. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 3 Adverse drug reactions in patients treated with Cotellic in combination with \nvemurafenib in Study GO28141^ \n \nSystem organ class Very Common  \n\n \nCommon Uncommon \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified (incl. cysts \nand polyps) \n\n Basal cell carcinoma,  \nCutaneous squamous \ncell  carcinoma**, \nKeratoacanthoma** \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nAnaemia   \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Dehydration, \nHypophosphataemia, \nHyponatremia, \nHyperglycaemia \n \n\n \n\nEye disorders Serous retinopathya, \nBlurred vision \n \n\nVisual impairment \n \n\n \n\nVascular disorders Hypertension, \nHaemorrhage* \n \n\n  \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders  \n\n Pneumonitis \n \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n \n\nDiarrhoea, Nausea, \nVomiting \n \n\n  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nPhotosensitivityb, Rash, \nRash maculo-papular, \nDermatitis acneiform, \nHyperkeratosis** \n \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Rhabdomyolysis*** \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia, Chills \n \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  Blood CPK increased, \nALT increased, AST \nincreased, Gamma-\nGlutamyltransferase \n(GGT) increased, Blood \nALP  increased \n\nEjection fraction \ndecreased, Blood \nbilirubin increased \n \n\n \n\n^ Data cut-off date of 19 September 2014 \n* Please refer to the paragraph Haemorrhage in the “Description of selected adverse reactions” section \n** Please refer to the paragraph Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma and hyperkeratosis in \nthe “Description of selected adverse reactions” section. \n*** Please refer to the paragraph Rhabdomyolysis  in the “Description of selected adverse reactions” section. \na Includes both chorioretinopathy and retinal detachment events indicative of serous retinopathy (see section 4.4) \nb Combined figure includes reports of photosensitivity reaction, sunburn, solar dermatitis, actinic elastosis \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHaemorrhage \n \nBleeding events have been reported more frequently in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm than in the \nplacebo plus vemurafenib arm (all types and Grades: 13% vs 7%).  The median time to first onset was \n6.1 months in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm. \n \nThe majority of events were Grade 1 or 2 and non-serious. Most events resolved with no change in \nCotellic dose. Major haemorrhagic events (including intracranial and gastrointestinal tract \nhaemorrhage) were reported in the post-marketing setting. The risk of haemorrhage may be increased \nwith concomitant use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. If haemorrhage occurs, treat as clinically \nindicated (see section 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nRhabdomyolysis  \n \nRhabdomyolysis has been reported in the post-marketing setting.  Signs or symptoms of \nrhabdomyolysis warrant an appropriate clinical evaluation and treatment as indicated, along with \nCotellic dose modification or discontinuation according to the severity of the adverse reaction (see \nsection 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nPhotosensitivity \n \nPhotosensitivity has been observed with a higher frequency in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm vs \nplacebo plus vemurafenib arm (47% vs 35%).  The majority of events were Grades 1 or 2, with \nGrade ≥3 events occurring in 4% of patients in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm vs 0% in the placebo \nplus vemurafenib arm.  \n \nThere were no apparent trends in the time of onset of Grade ≥3 events. Grade ≥3 photosensitivity \nevents in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm were treated with primary topical medicinal products in \nconjunction with dose interruptions of both cobimetinib and vemurafenib (see section 4.2). \n \nNo evidence of phototoxicity was observed with Cotellic as a single agent. \n \nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma and hyperkeratosis \n \nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has been reported with a lower frequency in the Cotellic plus \nvemurafenib arm vs placebo plus vemurafenib arm (all Grade: 3% vs 13%).  Keratoacanthoma has \nbeen reported with a lower frequency in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm vs placebo plus \nvemurafenib arm (all Grade: 2% vs 9%). Hyperkeratosis has been reported with a lower frequency in \nthe Cotellic plus vemurafenib vs placebo plus vemurafenib arm (all Grade: 11% vs 30%). \n \nSerous retinopathy  \n \nCases of serous retinopathy have been reported in patients treated with Cotellic (see section 4.4.) For \npatients reporting new or worsening visual disturbances, an ophthalmologic examination is \nrecommended. Serous retinopathy can be managed with treatment interruption, dose reduction or with \ntreatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in section 4.2). \n \nLeft ventricular dysfunction  \n \nDecrease in LVEF from baseline has been reported in patients receiving Cotellic (see section 4.4). \nLVEF should be evaluated before initiation of treatment to establish baseline values, then after the first \nmonth of treatment and at least every 3 months or as clinically indicated until treatment \ndiscontinuation.  Decrease in LVEF from baseline can be managed using treatment interruption, dose \nreduction or with treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLiver laboratory abnormalities \nLiver laboratory abnormalities, specifically ALT, AST, and ALP have been observed in patients \ntreated with Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib (see section 4.4).   \nLiver laboratory tests should be monitored before initiation of combination treatment and monthly \nduring treatment, or more frequently if clinically indicated (see section 4.2). \n \nBlood creatine phosphokinase increase \nAsymptomatic increases in blood CPK levels were observed with a higher frequency in the Cotellic \nplus vemurafenib arm vs placebo plus vemurafenib arm in Study GO28141 (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \nOne event of rhabdomyolysis was observed in each treatment arm of the study with concurrent \nincreases in blood CPK.  \n \nTable 4 provides the frequency of measured liver laboratory abnormalities and elevated creatine \nphosphokinase for all Grades and Grades 3-4. \n \nTable 4 Liver function and other laboratory tests observed in the Phase III Study GO28141 \n \n\nChanges in reported \nlaboratory data \n\nCobimetinib plus \nvemurafenib \n\n(n = 247) \n (%) \n\nPlacebo plus vemurafenib \n(n = 246) \n\n(%) \n\n All Grades Grades 3-4 All Grades Grades 3-4 \nLiver function test \nIncreased ALP 69 7 55 3 \nIncreased ALT 67 11 54 5 \nIncreased AST 71 7 43 2 \nIncreased GGT 62 20 59 17 \nIncreased blood bilirubin 33 2 43 1 \nOther laboratory abnormalities \nIncreased blood CPK 70 12 14 <1 \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \n \nIn the Phase III study with Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib in patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic melanoma (n=247), 183 patients (74%) were <65 years of age, and 44 patients (18%) were \n65-74 years of age, 16 (6%) were 75-84 years of age, and 4 patients (2%) were aged ≥85 years. The \nproportion of patients experiencing adverse events (AE) was similar in the patients aged <65 years and \nthose aged ≥65 years. Patients ≥65 years were more likely to experience serious adverse events \n(SAEs) and experience AEs leading to discontinuation of cobimetinib than those <65 years. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with renal impairment has been conducted. Dose adjustment is \nnot recommended for mild to moderate renal impairment based on the results of the population \npharmacokinetic analysis. There are minimal data for Cotellic in patients with severe renal impairment. \nCotellic should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.  \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose in human clinical studies. In case of suspected overdose, \ncobimetinib should be withheld and supportive care instituted. There is no specific antidote for \noverdosage with cobimetinib. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE38 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nCobimetinib is a reversible, selective, allosteric, oral inhibitor that blocks the mitogen-activated \nprotein kinase (MAPK) pathway by targeting the mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated \nkinase (MEK) 1 and MEK 2 which results in inhibition of phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-\nregulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK 2. Therefore, cobimetinib blocks the cell proliferation induced by \nthe MAPK pathway through inhibition of the MEK1/2 signalling node. \n \nIn the preclinical models, the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib showed that by \nsimultaneously targeting mutated BRAF V600 proteins and MEK proteins in melanoma cells, the \ncombination of the two products inhibits MAPK pathway reactivation through MEK1/2, resulting in a \nstronger inhibition of intracellular signalling and decreased tumour cell proliferation  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThere are no data on the safety or efficacy of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib in patients \nwith central nervous system metastasis or in patients with non-cutaneous malignant melanoma. \n \nStudy GO28141 (coBRIM) \n \nStudy GO28141 is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study to \nevaluate the safety and efficacy of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib as compared to \nvemurafenib plus placebo, in previously untreated patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive \nunresectable locally advanced (Stage IIIc) or metastatic melanoma (Stage IV).  \n \nOnly patients with ECOG performance status 0 and 1 were enrolled in Study GO28141. Patients with \nECOG performance status 2 or higher were excluded from the study. \n \nFollowing confirmation of a BRAF V600 mutation, using the cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test, \n495 previously untreated patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma were \nrandomised to receive either: \n\n∑ Placebo once daily on Days 1-21 of each 28-day treatment cycle and 960 mg vemurafenib \ntwice daily on Days 1-28, or \n\n∑ Cotellic 60 mg once daily on Days 1-21 of each 28-day treatment cycle and 960 mg \nvemurafenib twice daily on Days 1-28 \n\n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n16 \n\nProgression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator (INV) was the primary endpoint.  \nSecondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, duration of \nresponse (DoR) as assessed by INV and PFS as assessed by an independent review facility (IRF). \n \nKey baseline characteristics included: 58% of patients were male, median age was 55 years (range 23 \nto 88 years), 60% had metastatic melanoma stage M1c and the proportion of patients with elevated \nLDH was 46.3% in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 43.0% in the placebo plus vemurafenib \narm.  \n \nIn Study GO28141, there were 89 patients (18.1%) aged 65-74, 38 patients (7.7%) aged 75-84 and \n5 patients (1.0%) aged 85 years and older. \n  \nEfficacy results are summarized in Table 5. \n \nTable 5 Efficacy results from Study GO28141 (coBRIM)  \n \n\n Cotellic + vemurafenib                                                                  N=247     \nPlacebo + vemurafenib \n\nN=248                                       \n\n  \n\nPrimary Endpointa, f  \n\nProgression-Free Survival (PFS) \nMedian (months) \n(95 % CI) \n\n12.3     \n(9.5, 13.4)      \n\n7.2   \n(5.6, 7.5)                               \n\nHazard ratio (95% CI) b 0.58 (0.46; 0.72) \n\nKey Secondary Endpointsa, f,  \n\nOverall Survival (OS)g \nMedian (months) \n(95 % CI) \n\n22.3  \n(20.3, NE) \n\n17.4  \n(15.0, 19.8) \n\nHazard ratio (95% CI)b \n0.70 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.90) \n\n(p-value = 0.0050e) \n\nObjective response rate \n(ORR) 172 (69.6%) 124 (50.0%) \n\n(95% CI) for ORRc (63.5%, 75.3%) (43.6%, 56.4%) \nDifference in ORR % (95% CI) d 19.6 (11.0, 28.3) \nBest Overall Response (BOR) \nComplete Response 39 (15.8%) 26 (10.5%) \nPartial Response 133 (53.8%) 98 (39.5%) \nStable disease 44 (17.8%) 92 (37.1%) \nDuration of Response (DoR) \nMedian DoR (months) \n(95% CI) for median \n\n13 \n(11.1, 16.6) \n\n9.2 \n(7.5, 12.8) \n\nNE = Not evaluable \na Assessed and confirmed by the investigator (INV) using RECIST v1.1 \nb Stratified analysis by geographic region and metastasis classification (disease stage) \nc Using Clopper-Pearson method \nd Using Hauck-Anderson method \ne The OS p-value (0.0050) crossed the pre-specified boundary (p value <0.0499) \nf The data cut-off date for this updated PFS analysis and the secondary endpoints of ORR, BOR and DoR is \n16 January 2015.

The objective response rate (ORR) in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm was 67.6% vs \n44.8% in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. The difference in ORR was 22.9 % (p-value<0.0001). \n \nThe final OS analysis for Study GO28141 was conducted with a data-cut off date of 28 August 2015.  \nSignificant improvement in OS was observed in patients assigned to the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm \ncompared to the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (Figure 1). The 1-year (75 %) and 2-year (48 %) OS \nestimates for the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm were greater than those for placebo plus vemurafenib \narm (64 % and 38 % respectively). \n \nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves of final overall survival – Intent to treat population (cut-off date: \n28 August 2015) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nFigure 2: Forest plot for hazard ratios of final overall survival subgroup analyses – Intent to \ntreat population (cut-off date: 28 August 2015) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGlobal health status / health-related quality of life by patient-report were measured using the EORTC \nQuality of Life Questionnaire – Core 30 (QLQ-C30). Scores for all functioning domains and most \nsymptoms (appetite loss, constipation, nausea and vomiting, dyspnoea, pain, fatigue) showed that the \nmean change from baseline was similar between the two treatment arms and did not demonstrate a \nclinically meaningful change (all scores were ≤ 10 point change from baseline). \n \nStudy NO25395 (BRIM7) \n \nThe efficacy of Cotellic was evaluated in Phase Ib Study, NO25395, which was designed to assess the \nsafety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of Cotellic when added to vemurafenib for the \ntreatment of patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive (as detected by the cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 \nMutation Test), unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  \nThis study treated 129 patients with Cotellic and vemurafenib: 63 were BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) \ntherapy naïve and 66 patients had previously progressed on prior vemurafenib therapy. Among the 63 \nBRAFi naïve patients, 20 patients had received prior systemic therapy for advanced melanoma with \nthe majority (80%) being immunotherapy.  \n \nResults of the BRAFi naïve population from Study NO25395 were generally consistent with those \nfrom Study GO28141. The BRAFi-naïve patients (n=63) attained an 87% objective response rate, \nincluding a complete response in 16% of patients. The median duration of response was 14.3 months. \nThe median PFS for BRAFi-naïve patients was 13.8 months, with median follow-up time of \n20.6 months.  \n \nAmong patients who had progressed on vemurafenib (n=66), the objective response rate was 15%. The \nmedian duration of response was 6.8 months. The median PFS for patients who had progressed on \nvemurafenib was 2.8 months, with median follow-up time of 8.1 months. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nIn patients who were naive to BRAF inhibitor therapy, the median overall survival was 28.5 months \n(95% CI 23.3-34.6). In patients who had progressed on BRAF inhibitor therapy, the median overall \nsurvival was 8.4 months (95% CI 6.7-11.1).  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nCotellic in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in malignant solid tumours (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral dosing of 60 mg in cancer patients, cobimetinib showed a moderate rate of absorption \nwith a median Tmax of 2.4 hours. The mean steady-state Cmax and AUC0-24 were 273 ng/mL and \n4340 ng.h/mL respectively. The mean accumulation ratio at steady state was approximately 2.4-fold. \nCobimetinib has linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of ~3.5 mg to 100 mg. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of cobimetinib was 45.9% (90% CI: 39.7%, 53.1%) in healthy subjects. \nA human mass balance study was conducted in healthy subjects, and showed that cobimetinib was \nextensively metabolised and eliminated in faeces. The fraction absorbed was ~88% indicating high \nabsorption and first pass metabolism.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib are not altered when administered in the fed state (high-fat meal) \ncompared with the fasted state in healthy subjects. Since food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of \ncobimetinib, it can be administered with or without food.   \n \nDistribution \n \nCobimetinib is 94.8% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. No preferential binding to human red \nblood cells was observed (blood to plasma ratio 0.93).  \n \nThe volume of distribution was 1050 L in healthy subjects given an intravenous dose of 2 mg. The \napparent volume of distribution was 806 L in cancer patients based on population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis. \n \nCobimetinib is a substrate of P-gp in vitro. The transport across the blood brain barrier is unknown. \n \nBiotransformation \n  \nOxidation by CYP3A and glucuronidation by UGT2B7 appear to be the major pathways of \ncobimetinib metabolism. Cobimetinib is the predominant moiety in plasma. No oxidative metabolites \ngreater than 10% of total circulating radioactivity or human specific metabolites were observed in \nplasma. Unchanged medicinal product in faeces and urine accounted for 6.6% and 1.6% of the \nadministered dose, respectively, indicating that cobimetinib is primarily metabolised with minimal \nrenal elimination. In vitro data indicate cobimetinib is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2. \n \nElimination \n \nCobimetinib and its metabolites were characterised in a mass balance study in healthy subjects. On \naverage, 94% of the dose was recovered within 17 days. Cobimetinib was extensively metabolised and \neliminated in faeces. \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of a 2 mg dose of cobimetinib, the mean plasma clearance (CL) \nwas 10.7 L/hr. The mean apparent CL following oral dosing of 60 mg in cancer patients was 13.8 L/hr. \n\n\n\n20 \n\nThe mean elimination half-life following oral dosing of cobimetinib was 43.6 hours (range: 23.1 to \n69.6 hours). Therefore, it may take up to 2 weeks following treatment cessation for cobimetinib to be \ncompletely removed from systemic circulation.    \n \nSpecial populations \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender, race, ethnicity, baseline ECOG, mild and \nmoderate renal impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetic of cobimetinib. Baseline age and \nbaseline body weight were identified as statistically significant covariates on cobimetinib clearance \nand volume of distribution respectively. However, sensitivity analysis suggests neither of these \ncovariates had clinically significant impact on steady state exposure. \n \nGender \n \nGender does not have an effect on the exposure of cobimetinib, based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis including 210 women and 277 men. \n \nElderly \n \nAge does not have an effect on the exposure of cobimetinib, based on a population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis including 133 patients ≥ 65 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nBased on preclinical data and the human mass balance study, cobimetinib is mainly metabolised, with \nminimal renal elimination. No formal pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with renal \nimpairment.  \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from 151 patients with mild renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance (CRCL) 60 to less than 90 mL/min), 48 patients with moderate renal impairment \n(CRCL 30 to less than 60 mL/min), and 286 patients with normal renal function (CRCL greater than \nor equal to 90 mL/min), showed that CRCL had no meaningful influence on exposure of cobimetinib. \nMild to moderate renal impairment does not influence cobimetinib exposure based on the population \npharmacokinetic analysis.  There are minimal data for Cotellic in patients with severe renal \nimpairment.  \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib were evaluated in 6 subjects with mild hepatic impairment \n(Child Pugh A), 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), 6 subjects with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) and 10 healthy subjects. Systemic total cobimetinib exposures \nafter a single dose were similar in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to \nhealthy subjects, while subjects with severe hepatic impairment had lower total cobimetinib exposures \n(AUC0-∞ geometric mean ratio of 0.69 compared to healthy subjects) which is not considered to be \nclinically significant. Unbound cobimetinib exposures were similar between subjects with mild and \nmoderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function while subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment had approximately 2-fold higher exposures (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib in paediatric \npatients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with cobimetinib. Standard genotoxicity studies with \ncobimetinib were negative. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nNo dedicated fertility studies in animals have been performed with cobimetinib. In  toxicology studies, \ndegenerative changes were observed in reproductive tissues including increased apoptosis/necrosis of \ncorpora lutea and seminal vesicle, epididymal and vaginal epithelial cells in rats, and epididymal \nepithelial cells in dogs. The clinical relevance of this is unknown.  \n \nWhen administered to pregnant rats, cobimetinib caused embryolethality and foetal malformations of \nthe great vessels and skull at systemic exposures similar to human exposure at recommended dose.  \n \nCardiovascular safety of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib has not been evaluated in vivo. \nIn vitro, cobimetinib produced moderate hERG ion channel inhibition (IC50= 0.5 µM [266 ng/mL]), \nwhich is approximately 18 fold higher than peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) at the 60 mg to be \nmarketed dose (unbound Cmax=14 ng/mL [0.03 µM]).  \n \nToxicity studies in rats and dogs identified generally reversible degenerative changes in the bone \nmarrow, gastrointestinal tract, skin, thymus, adrenal gland, liver, spleen, lymph node, kidney, heart, \novary, and vagina at plasma exposures below clinical efficacious levels.  Dose limiting toxicities \nincluded skin ulcerations, surface exudates, and acanthosis in the rat and chronic active inflammation \nand degeneration of the oesophagus associated with varying degrees of gastroenteropathy in dogs. \n \nIn a repeat dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, cobimetinib systemic exposures were 2 to11 fold higher \non post natal day 10 than on post natal day 38 when exposures were similar to those in adult rats. In \njuvenile rats, cobimetinib administration resulted in similar changes as seen in the pivotal toxicity \nstudies in adults, including reversible degenerative changes in the thymus and liver, decreased spleen \nand thyroid/parathyroid weights, increased phosphorus, bilirubin and red blood cell mass and \ndecreased triglycerides. Mortality occurred in juvenile animals at a dose (3 mg/kg) which did not lead \nto mortalities in adult animals. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n31 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nCotellic 20 mg film-coated tablets \ncobimetinib \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n∑ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n∑ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n∑ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n∑ If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Cotellic is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Cotellic \n3. How to take Cotellic \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Cotellic \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Cotellic is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Cotellic is \nCotellic is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance cobimetinib.  \n \nWhat Cotellic is used for \nCotellic is used to treat adult patients with a type of skin cancer called melanoma, that has spread to \nother parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. \n∑ It is used in combination with another anti-cancer medicine called vemurafenib.  \n∑ It can only be used in patients whose cancer has a change (mutation) in a protein called “BRAF”. \n\nBefore starting treatment, your doctor will test for this mutation. This change may have led to the \ndevelopment of melanoma.  \n\n \nHow Cotellic works \nCotellic targets a protein called “MEK” that is important in controlling cancer cell growth. When \nCotellic is used in combination with vemurafenib (which targets the changed “BRAF” protein), it \nfurther slows down or stops the growth of your cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Cotellic \n \nDo not take Cotellic: \n∑ if you are allergic to cobimetinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Cotellic. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Cotellic if you have: \n \n∑ Bleeding \nCotellic can cause severe bleeding, especially in your brain or stomach (see also “Severe bleeding” in \nSection 4). Tell your doctor straight away if you have any unusual bleeding or any of these \nsymptoms: headaches, dizziness, feeling weak, blood in the stools or black stools and vomiting blood.   \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n∑ Eye problems \nCotellic can cause eye problems (see also “Eye (vision) problems” in Section 4). Tell your doctor \nstraight away if you get the following symptoms: blurred vision, distorted vision, partly missing vision, \nor any other changes to your sight during treatment. Your doctor should examine your eyes if you \nhave any new or worsening problems with your sight while you are taking Cotellic. \n\n \n∑ Heart problems \nCotellic can lower the amount of blood pumped by your heart (see also “Heart problems” in \nSection 4). Your doctor should do tests before and during your treatment with Cotellic to check how \nwell your heart can pump blood. Tell your doctor straight away if it feels like your heart is pounding, \nracing or beating unevenly, or if you experience dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, \ntiredness, or swelling in the legs.  \n \n∑ Liver problems \nCotellic can increase the amount of some liver enzymes in your blood during treatment. Your doctor \nwill do blood tests to check these amounts and monitor how well your liver is working.   \n\n \n∑ Muscle problems \nCotellic can cause increased levels of creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme that is found mainly in the \nmuscle, heart, and brain. This can be a sign of muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis) (see also “Muscle \nproblems” in Section 4). Your doctor will do blood tests to monitor for this. Tell your doctor straight \naway if you get any of these symptoms: muscle aches, muscle spasms, weakness, or dark- or red-\ncoloured urine.  \n\n \n∑ Diarrhoea \nTell your doctor straight away if you get diarrhoea. Severe diarrhoea can cause loss of body fluid \n(dehydration). Follow your doctor’s instructions for what to do to help prevent or treat diarrhoea. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nCotellic is not recommended for children and adolescents. The effects of Cotellic in people younger \nthan 18 years old are not known. \n \nOther medicines and Cotellic \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \nThis is because Cotellic can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines \ncan affect the way Cotellic works. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Cotellic if you are taking: \n \n\nMedicine  Purpose of the medicine \nitraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, \ntelithromycin, voriconazole, rifampicin, \nposaconazole, fluconazole, miconazole \n\nfor some fungal and bacterial infections \n\nritonavir, cobicistat, lopinavir, delavirdine, \namprenavir, fosamprenavir  \n\nfor HIV infection \n\ntelaprevir for hepatitis C \nnefadozone for depression \namiodarone for an uneven heartbeat \ndiltiazem, verapamil for high blood pressure  \nimatinib for cancer \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin for fits (seizures) \nSt John’s Wort a herbal medicine, used to treat depression. \n\nThis is available without prescription. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \nCotellic with food and drink \nAvoid taking Cotellic with grapefruit juice. This is because it could increase the amount of Cotellic in \nyour blood. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n∑ Cotellic is not recommended during pregnancy - although the effects of Cotellic have not been \n\nstudied in pregnant women, it may cause permanent harm or birth defects to an unborn baby.  \n∑ If you become pregnant during treatment with Cotellic or in the 3 months after your last dose, tell \n\nyour doctor straight away.   \n∑ It is not known if Cotellic passes into breast milk. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits \n\nand risks of taking Cotellic, if you are breast-feeding.  \n \nContraception \nWomen of childbearing potential should use two effective methods of contraception, such as a \ncondom or other barrier method (with spermicide, if available) during treatment and for at least \n3 months after treatment has finished. Ask your doctor about the best contraception for you. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCotellic can affect your ability to drive or use machines. Avoid driving or using machines if you have \nproblems with your vision or other problems that might affect your ability e.g. if you feel dizzy or \ntired. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure.  \n \nCotellic contains lactose and sodium \nThe tablets contain lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.   \n \n \n3. How to take Cotellic \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is 3 tablets (a total of 60 mg) once a day.  \n∑ Take the tablets every day for 21 days (called a “treatment period”).  \n∑ After the 21 days, do not take any Cotellic tablets for 7 days. During this 7 day break in Cotellic \n\ntreatment, you should keep taking vemurafenib as told by your doctor. \n∑ Start your next Cotellic 21 day treatment period after the 7 day break. \n∑ If you get side effects, your doctor may decide to lower your dose, stop treatment temporarily or \n\npermanently. Always take Cotellic exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. \n \nTaking the medicine \n∑ Swallow the tablets whole with water. \n∑ Cotellic can be taken with or without food.  \n \nIf you are sick \nIf you are sick (vomit) after taking Cotellic, do not take an extra dose of Cotellic on that day. Continue \nto take Cotellic as normal, the next day.   \n \nIf you take more Cotellic than you should \nIf you take more Cotellic than you should, talk to a doctor straight away. Take the medicine package \n\n\n\n34 \n\nand this leaflet with you.  \n \nIf you forget to take Cotellic \n∑ If it is more than 12 hours before your next dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember.  \n∑ If it is less than 12 hours before your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take the next dose at \n\nthe usual time. \n∑ Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Cotellic \nIt is important to keep taking Cotellic for as long as your doctor prescribes it.  \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. If you get \nside effects your doctor may decide to lower your dose, stop treatment temporarily or permanently. \n \nPlease also refer to the Package Leaflet for vemurafenib, which is used in combination with Cotellic. \n \nSerious side effects \nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the side effects listed below or if these get worse \nduring treatment. \n \n\nSevere bleeding (common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nCotellic can cause severe bleeding, especially in your brain or stomach. Depending on the area \nof the bleeding, symptoms may include: \n∑ headaches, dizziness, or weakness \n∑ vomiting blood \n∑ abdominal pain \n∑ red or black coloured stools. \n \nEye (vision) problems (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \nCotellic can cause eye problems.
