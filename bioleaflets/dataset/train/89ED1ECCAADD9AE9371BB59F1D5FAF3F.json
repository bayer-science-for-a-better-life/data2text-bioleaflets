This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVedrop 50 mg/ml oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 50 mg of d-alpha-tocopherol, in the form of tocofersolan, corresponding to 74.5 IU of \ntocopherol. \n\n \nExcipients:  \nEach ml contains 6 mg sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219), 4 mg sodium ethyl \nparahydroxybenzoate (E215) and 0.18 mmoles (4.1 mg) of sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution. \n \nSlightly viscous, pale yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVedrop is indicated in vitamin E deficiency due to digestive malabsorption in paediatric patients with \ncongenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis, from birth (full term newborns) up to 18 \nyears of age. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe treatment with Vedrop should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of patients suffering from congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis. \n \nBioavailability of vitamin E from Vedrop differs from that of other medicinal products. The dose should be \nprescribed in mg of d-alpha-tocopherol in the form of tocofersolan. Plasma vitamin E level should be \nmonitored monthly for at least the first few months of therapy, thereafter at regular intervals and the dose \nadjusted accordingly if necessary.  \n \nPosology \nThe recommended total daily dose in paediatric patients suffering from congenital chronic cholestasis or \nhereditary chronic cholestasis is 0.34 ml/kg/day (17 mg/kg of d-alpha-tocopherol in the form of \ntocofersolan). The dose should be prescribed in ml. \n \nThe dose should be adjusted according to plasma vitamin E level. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nTo calculate the dose of Vedrop to be administered, divide the prescribed dose of d-alpha-tocopherol (in mg) \nby 50. The result is the volume of Vedrop in ml: \n \n\n \nDose of Vedrop (in ml) = dose of d-alpha-tocopherol (in mg) \n\n                     50 \n \n\n \nThe following table gives the volume of oral solution in function of patients\u2019 weights. \n \n\nWeight (kg) Oral solution volume (ml) \n\n3 1.0 \n4 1.4 \n5 1.7 \n6 2.0 \n7 2.4 \n8 2.7 \n9 3.1 \n10 3.4 \n15 5.1 \n\n \n \nSpecial populations \n\nHepatic or renal impairment \n\nExperience with tocofersolan therapy in patients with renal impairment or underlying liver impairment has \ndemonstrated no need to adapt the dose regimen of Vedrop (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \nVedrop is administered orally with or without water. The 1-ml or 2-ml oral syringes included in the \ncontainer are designed to assist in measuring out the exact dose in accordance with the prescribed posology. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nVedrop must not be used in preterm newborn infants. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs large doses of vitamin E have been reported to increase bleeding tendency in vitamin-K deficient patients \nor those taking oral anti-vitamins K treatment, it is therefore recommended to monitor the prothrombin time \nand international normalised ratio (INR). A possible adjustment of the dose of oral anticoagulant during and \nafter treatment with Vedrop may be necessary. \n \nAs data on patients with renal impairment are limited, Vedrop should be administered with caution and \nunder close monitoring of the renal function in patients with renal impairment e.g. dehydrated patients (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nVedrop should be administered with caution in patients with underlying liver impairment and under close \nmonitoring of the hepatic functions in such patients (see section 4.2). \n \nVedrop contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) and sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate \n(E215) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nThis medicinal product contains sodium. It should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled \nsodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nIt is recommended to monitor the coagulation function when administered with anti-vitamins K treatment \n(see section 4.4). \n \nDue to inhibition of P-Glycoprotein transporter, tocofersolan may also enhance intestinal absorption of other \nconcomitant fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) or that of highly lipophilic medicinal products (such as \nsteroids, antibiotics, antihistamines, cyclosporine, tacrolimus). Therefore, monitoring should be performed \nand, when necessary, doses should be adjusted. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor tocofersolan no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-\nnatal development (see section 5.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether tocofersolan is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of tocofersolan in milk \nhas not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to \ncontinue/discontinue therapy with Vedrop should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding \nto the child and the benefit of tocofersolan therapy to the woman. \n \nFertility \nNo data is available \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVedrop has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reaction during treatment is diarrhoea. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nReported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency.  \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10),  uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).  \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nSystem organ class \n \n\nAdverse reactions \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n\nCommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: abdominal pain \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \n\nUncommon: alopecia, pruritus, rash \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n \n\nUncommon: asthenia, headache \n\nInvestigations \n \n\nUncommon: serum sodium abnormal, serum potassium \nabnormal, transaminases increase \n\n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLarge vitamin E doses may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal disturbances.  \nIn case of overdose, a symptomatic treatment should be proposed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vitamins, Other plain vitamin preparations; ATC code: A11HA08 \n \nVitamin E is the principal lipo-soluble antioxidant in the organism. It acts as a free radical chain breaking \nmolecule, stopping the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and it is involved in maintaining the \nstability and integrity of cell membranes. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. This means that due to the \nrarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.  \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year \nand this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe active substance d-alpha-tocopherol-polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (tocofersolan) is a pro-drug; the \nactive metabolite is the d-alpha-tocopherol. At low concentrations, tocofersolan forms micelles which \nenhance absorption of non-polar lipids such as fat-soluble vitamins. Its critical micellar concentration is low \n(0.04 to 0.06 mmol/l).  \n \nThe hydrolysis of tocofersolan occurs in the gut lumen. Taken up by cells, the alpha-tocopherol moiety \nappears in chylomicrons in the lymph in a manner identical to vitamin E absorbed from the diet. Cellular \nuptake does not require receptors, binding proteins or metabolic processes and does not occur by \npinocytosis. Absorption of deuterated tocofersolan showed a normal pattern in lipoproteins: alpha-\ntocopherol peaked first in chylomicrons, then in very low- density lipoproteins (VLDL) and finally in low-\ndensity lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and the disappearance portions of the \ncurves paralleled those in control subjects.  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \nA study in 12 healthy volunteers compared tocofersolan with a water-miscible reference vitamin E after a \nsingle oral loading dose of 1200 IU. The relative bioavailability of tocofersolan tended to be higher (Frel of \n1.01 \u00b1 1.74) with AUC0-t of 0.383 \u00b1 0.203\u00b5M.h/mg, Cmax of 0.013 \u00b1 0.006, tmax of 6.0 h (6.0 \u2013 24.0), and t1/2 \nof 29.7 h (16.0 \u2013 59.5). \n \nIn a similar study tocofersolan showed a higher bioavailability than a water-miscible reference vitamin E in \npaediatric patients with chronic cholestasis (n=6), absorption was significantly higher on both plasma \nconcentration maximum increase (p=0.008) and AUC (p=0.0026). \n \nDistribution \nLocated principally on cell membranes, within mitochondria and microsomes, vitamin E is ubiquitously \ndistributed (red blood cells, brain, muscle, liver, platelets) and fat tissues are its major reservoir. \n \nElimination \nVitamin E is mainly eliminated in the bile (75%) and stools, either as free tocopherol or as oxidized forms. \nUrine represents a minor elimination route of vitamin E (as glucuro-conjugate). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data in the literature reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction. \n \n \n6.

What Vedrop is and what it is used for \n\n \nVedrop contains vitamin E (in the form of tocofersolan). It is used to treat lack of vitamin E due to digestive \nmalabsorption (where nutrients from the food are not easily absorbed during digestion) in patients from birth \n(full term newborns) up to 18 years of age suffering from chronic cholestasis (a hereditary or congenital \ndisease where bile cannot flow from the liver to the intestine). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vedrop \n \nDo not take Vedrop  \n- If you are allergic to vitamin E (d-alpha-tocopherol) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \nin section 6). \n- Vedrop must not be used in newborn premature babies. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking Vedrop if you have: \n\uf0a7 Problems with your kidney or dehydration. Vedrop should be used with caution and your kidney \n\nfunction closely monitored, because polyethylene glycol, part of the active substance tocofersolan, may \ndamage your kidneys.  \n\n\uf0a7 Problems with your liver. Vedrop should be used with caution and liver functions closely monitored. \n \nOther medicines and Vedrop \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \n \n \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking:  \n\uf0a7 Certain medicines to thin the blood (oral anticoagulants such as warfarin). Your doctor will ask you to \n\nperform blood tests regularly and may adjust their dose to avoid higher risk of bleeding. \n\uf0a7 Fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin A, D, E or K) or highly fat-soluble medicines (such as corticoids, \n\nciclosporin, tacrolimus, antihistamine). As Vedrop may increase their absorption during digestion, your \ndoctor will monitor the treatment effect and adjust the doses if necessary. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nNo clinical data are available on exposure to this medicine during pregnancy. Inform your doctor if you are \npregnant as he/she will decide if the medicine may be used.  \nThere is no data on whether or not this medicine is present in the breast milk. Inform your doctor if you \nwant to breast-feed. Your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVedrop is not likely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nVedrop contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) and sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate \n(E215), which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n \nVedrop contains 0.18 mmoles (4.1 mg) sodium per ml.
