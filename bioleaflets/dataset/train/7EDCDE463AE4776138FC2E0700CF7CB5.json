NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNexavar 200 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg of sorafenib (as tosylate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nRed, round, biconvex film-coated tablets, debossed with Bayer cross on one side and \"200\" on the \nother side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nHepatocellular carcinoma \n \nNexavar is indicated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal cell carcinoma \n \nNexavar is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have failed \nprior interferon-alpha or interleukin-2 based therapy or are considered unsuitable for such therapy. \n \nDifferentiated thyroid carcinoma \n \nNexavar is indicated for the treatment of patients with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic, \ndifferentiated (papillary/follicular/H\u00fcrthle cell) thyroid carcinoma, refractory to radioactive iodine. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNexavar treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer therapies. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Nexavar in adults is 400 mg sorafenib (two tablets of 200 mg) twice daily \n(equivalent to a total daily dose of 800 mg).  \n \nTreatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n \nPosology adjustments \n \nManagement of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption or dose \nreduction of sorafenib therapy.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nWhen dose reduction is necessary during the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and \nadvanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the Nexavar dose should be reduced to two tablets of 200 mg \nsorafenib once daily (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen dose reduction is necessary during the treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), the \nNexavar dose should be reduced to 600 mg sorafenib daily in divided doses (two tablets of 200 mg \nand one tablet of 200 mg twelve hours apart). \nIf additional dose reduction is necessary, Nexavar may be reduced to 400 mg sorafenib daily in \ndivided doses (two tablets of 200 mg twelve hours apart), and if necessary further reduced to one \ntablet of 200 mg once daily. After improvement of non-haematological adverse reactions, the dose of \nNexavar may be increased. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Nexavar in children and adolescents aged < 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment is required in the elderly (patients above 65 years of age). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. No data is \navailable in patients requiring dialysis (see section 5.2). \n \nMonitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes in patients at risk of renal dysfunction is advised. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with Child Pugh A or B (mild to moderate) hepatic \nimpairment. No data is available on patients with Child Pugh C (severe) hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \nIt is recommended that sorafenib should be administered without food or with a low or moderate fat \nmeal. If the patient intends to have a high-fat meal, sorafenib tablets should be taken at least 1 hour \nbefore or 2 hours after the meal. The tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDermatological toxicities \n \nHand foot skin reaction (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia) and rash represent the most common \nadverse drug reactions with sorafenib. Rash and hand foot skin reaction are usually CTC (Common \nToxicity Criteria) Grade 1 and 2 and generally appear during the first six weeks of treatment with \nsorafenib. Management of dermatological toxicities may include topical therapies for symptomatic \nrelief, temporary treatment interruption and/or dose modification of sorafenib, or in severe or \npersistent cases, permanent discontinuation of sorafenib (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHypertension \n \nAn increased incidence of arterial hypertension was observed in sorafenib-treated patients. \nHypertension was usually mild to moderate, occurred early in the course of treatment, and was \namenable to management with standard antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored \nregularly and treated, if required, in accordance with standard medical practice. In cases of severe or \npersistent hypertension, or hypertensive crisis despite institution of antihypertensive therapy, \npermanent discontinuation of sorafenib should be considered (see section 4.8). \n \nAneurysms and artery dissections  \n \nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Nexavar, this risk should be \ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nDecreases in blood glucose, in some cases clinically symptomatic and requiring hospitalization due to \nloss of consciousness, have been reported during sorafenib treatment. In case of symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, sorafenib should be temporarily interrupted. Blood glucose levels in diabetic patients \nshould be checked regularly in order to assess if anti-diabetic medicinal product's dosage needs to be \nadjusted.  \n \nHaemorrhage \n \nAn increased risk of bleeding may occur following sorafenib administration. If any bleeding event \nnecessitates medical intervention it is recommended that permanent discontinuation of sorafenib \nshould be considered (see section 4.8).  \n \nCardiac ischaemia and/or infarction \n \nIn a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (study 1, see section 5.1) the incidence of \ntreatment-emergent cardiac ischaemia/infarction events was higher in the sorafenib group (4.9 %) \ncompared with the placebo group (0.4 %). In study 3 (see section 5.1) the incidence of treatment-\nemergent cardiac ischaemia/infarction events was 2.7 % in sorafenib patients compared with 1.3 % in \nthe placebo group. Patients with unstable coronary artery disease or recent myocardial infarction were \nexcluded from these studies. Temporary or permanent discontinuation of sorafenib should be \nconsidered in patients who develop cardiac ischaemia and/or infarction (see section 4.8). \n \nQT interval prolongation  \n \nSorafenib has been shown to prolong the QT/QTc interval (see section 5.1), which may lead to an \nincreased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Use sorafenib with caution in patients who have, or may \ndevelop prolongation of QTc, such as patients with a congenital long QT syndrome, patients treated \nwith a high cumulative dose of anthracycline therapy, patients taking certain anti-arrhythmic \nmedicines or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation, and those with electrolyte \ndisturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or hypomagnesaemia. When using sorafenib in \nthese patients, periodic monitoring with on-treatment electrocardiograms and electrolytes (magnesium, \npotassium, calcium) should be considered. \n \nGastrointestinal perforation \n \nGastrointestinal perforation is an uncommon event and has been reported in less than 1% of patients \ntaking sorafenib. In some cases this was not associated with apparent intra-abdominal tumour. \nSorafenib therapy should be discontinued (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo data is available on patients with Child Pugh C (severe) hepatic impairment. Since sorafenib is \nmainly eliminated via the hepatic route exposure might be increased in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nWarfarin co-administration \n \nInfrequent bleeding events or elevations in the International Normalised Ratio (INR) have been \nreported in some patients taking warfarin while on sorafenib therapy. Patients taking concomitant \nwarfarin or phenprocoumon should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time, INR or \nclinical bleeding episodes (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nWound healing complications \n \nNo formal studies of the effect of sorafenib on wound healing have been conducted. Temporary \ninterruption of sorafenib therapy is recommended for precautionary reasons in patients undergoing \nmajor surgical procedures. There is limited clinical experience regarding the timing of reinitiation of \ntherapy following major surgical intervention. Therefore, the decision to resume sorafenib therapy \nfollowing a major surgical intervention should be based on clinical judgement of adequate wound \nhealing. \n \nElderly population \n \nCases of renal failure have been reported. Monitoring of renal function should be considered.  \n \nDrug-drug interactions \n \nCaution is recommended when administering sorafenib with compounds that are \nmetabolised/eliminated predominantly by the UGT1A1 (e.g. irinotecan) or UGT1A9 pathways (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nCaution is recommended when sorafenib is co-administered with docetaxel (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of neomycin or other antibiotics that cause major ecological disturbances of the \ngastrointestinal microflora may lead to a decrease in sorafenib bioavailability (see section 4.5). The \nrisk of reduced plasma concentrations of sorafenib should be considered before starting a treatment \ncourse with antibiotics. \n \nHigher mortality has been reported in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung treated with \nsorafenib in combination with platinum-based chemotherapies. In two randomised trials investigating \npatients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the subgroup of patients with squamous cell carcinoma \ntreated with sorafenib as add-on to paclitaxel/carboplatin, the HR for overall survival was found to be \n1.81 (95% CI 1.19; 2.74) and as add-on to gemcitabine/cisplatin 1.22 (95% CI 0.82; 1.80). No single \ncause of death dominated, but higher incidence of respiratory failure, hemorrhages and infectious \nadverse events were observed in patients treated with sorafenib as add-on to platinum-based \nchemotherapies. \n \nDisease specific warnings \n \nDifferentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) \n \nBefore initiating treatment, physicians are recommended to carefully evaluate the prognosis in the \nindividual patient considering maximum lesion size (see section 5.1), symptoms related to the disease \n(see section 5.1) and progression rate. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nManagement of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption or dose \nreduction of sorafenib therapy. In study 5 (see section 5.1), 37% of subjects had dose interruption and \n35% had dose reduction already in cycle 1 of sorafenib treatment. \n \nDose reductions were only partially successful in alleviating adverse reactions. Therefore repeat \nevaluations of benefit and risk is recommended taking anti-tumour activity and tolerability into \naccount. \n \nHaemorrhage in DTC \nDue to the potential risk of bleeding, tracheal, bronchial, and oesophageal infiltration should be treated \nwith localized therapy prior to administering sorafenib in patients with DTC. \n \nHypocalcaemia in DTC  \nWhen using sorafenib in patients with DTC, close monitoring of blood calcium level is recommended. \nIn clinical trials, hypocalcaemia was more frequent and more severe in patients with DTC, especially \nwith a history of hypoparathyroidism, compared to patients with renal cell or hepatocellular \ncarcinoma. Hypocalcaemia grade 3 and 4 occurred in 6.8% and 3.4% of sorafenib-treated patients with \nDTC (see section 4.8). Severe hypocalcaemia should be corrected to prevent complications such as \nQT-prolongation or torsade de pointes (see section QT prolongation).   \n \nTSH suppression in DTC \nIn study 5 (see section 5.1), increases in TSH levels above 0.5mU/L were observed in sorafenib \ntreated patients. When using sorafenib in DTC patients, close monitoring of TSH level is \nrecommended. \n \nRenal cell carcinoma \n \nHigh Risk Patients, according to MSKCC (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) prognostic \ngroup, were not included in the phase III clinical study in renal cell carcinoma (see study 1 in section \n5.1), and benefit-risk in these patients has not been evaluated. \n \nInformation about excipients \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u201csodium \nfree\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInducers of metabolic enzymes \n \nAdministration of rifampicin for 5 days before administration of a single dose of sorafenib resulted in \nan average 37 % reduction of sorafenib AUC. Other inducers of CYP3A4 activity and/or \nglucuronidation (e.g. Hypericum perforatum also known as St. John\u2019s wort, phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, and dexamethasone) may also increase metabolism of sorafenib and \nthus decrease sorafenib concentrations. \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n \nKetoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, administered once daily for 7 days to healthy male \nvolunteers did not alter the mean AUC of a single 50 mg dose of sorafenib. These data suggest that \nclinical pharmacokinetic interactions of sorafenib with CYP3A4 inhibitors are unlikely. \n \nCYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates \n \nSorafenib inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 in vitro with similar potency. However, in \nclinical pharmacokinetic studies, concomitant administration of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily with \ncyclophosphamide, a CYP2B6 substrate, or paclitaxel, a CYP2C8 substrate, did not result in a \n\n\n\n7 \n\nclinically meaningful inhibition. These data suggest that sorafenib at the recommended dose of \n400 mg twice daily may not be an in vivo inhibitor of CYP2B6 or CYP2C8.  \nAdditionally, concomitant treatment with sorafenib and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, did not result \nin changes in mean PT-INR compared to placebo. Thus, also the risk for a clinically relevant in vivo \ninhibition of CYP2C9 by sorafenib may be expected to be low. However, patients taking warfarin or \nphenprocoumon should have their INR checked regularly (see section 4.4). \n \nCYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 substrates \n \nConcomitant administration of sorafenib and midazolam, dextromethorphan or omeprazole, which are \nsubstrates for cytochromes CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 respectively, did not alter the exposure \nof these agents. This indicates that sorafenib is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of these cytochrome \nP450 isoenzymes. Therefore, clinical pharmacokinetic interactions of sorafenib with substrates of \nthese enzymes are unlikely.  \n \nUGT1A1 and UGT1A9 substrates \n \nIn vitro, sorafenib inhibited glucuronidation via UGT1A1 and UGT1A9. The clinical relevance of this \nfinding is unknown (see below and section 4.4).  \n \nIn vitro studies of CYP enzyme induction \n \nCYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activities were not altered after treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with \nsorafenib, indicating that sorafenib is unlikely to be an inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. \n \nP-gp-substrates \n \nIn vitro, sorafenib has been shown to inhibit the transport protein p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Increased \nplasma concentrations of P-gp substrates such as digoxin cannot be excluded with concomitant \ntreatment with sorafenib. \n \nCombination with other anti-neoplastic agents \n \nIn clinical studies sorafenib has been administered with a variety of other anti-neoplastic agents at \ntheir commonly used dosing regimens including gemcitabine, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, \ncarboplatin, capecitabine, doxorubicin, irinotecan, docetaxel and cyclophosphamide. Sorafenib had no \nclinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin or \ncyclophosphamide. \n \nPaclitaxel/carboplatin \n \no Administration of paclitaxel (225 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC = 6) with sorafenib (\u2264 400 mg \n\ntwice daily), administered with a 3-day break in sorafenib dosing (two days prior to and on the \nday of paclitaxel/carboplatin administration), resulted in no significant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of paclitaxel.  \n\n \no Co-administration of paclitaxel (225 mg/m2, once every 3 weeks) and carboplatin (AUC=6) \n\nwith sorafenib (400 mg twice daily, without a break in sorafenib dosing) resulted in a 47% \nincrease in sorafenib exposure, a 29% increase in paclitaxel exposure and a 50% increase in 6-\nOH paclitaxel exposure. The pharmacokinetics of carboplatin were unaffected.  \n\n \nThese data indicate no need for dose adjustments when paclitaxel and carboplatin are co-administered \nwith sorafenib with a 3-day break in sorafenib dosing (two days prior to and on the day of \npaclitaxel/carboplatin administration). The clinical significance of the increases in sorafenib and \npaclitaxel exposure, upon co-administration of sorafenib without a break in dosing, is unknown. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nCapecitabine \n \nCo-administration of capecitabine (750-1050 mg/m2 twice daily, Days 1-14 every 21 days) and \nsorafenib (200 or 400 mg twice daily, continuous uninterrupted administration) resulted in no \nsignificant change in sorafenib exposure, but a 15-50% increase in capecitabine exposure and a 0-52% \nincrease in 5-FU exposure. The clinical significance of these small to modest increases in capecitabine \nand 5-FU exposure when co-administered with sorafenib is unknown. \n \nDoxorubicin/Irinotecan \n \nConcomitant treatment with sorafenib resulted in a 21 % increase in the AUC of doxorubicin. When \nadministered with irinotecan, whose active metabolite SN-38 is further metabolised by the UGT1A1 \npathway, there was a 67 - 120 % increase in the AUC of SN-38 and a 26 - 42 % increase in the AUC \nof irinotecan. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nDocetaxel \n \nDocetaxel (75 or 100 mg/m2 administered once every 21 days) when co-administered with sorafenib \n(200 mg twice daily or 400 mg twice daily administered on Days 2 through 19 of a 21-day cycle with \na 3-day break in dosing around administration of docetaxel) resulted in a 36-80 % increase in \ndocetaxel AUC and a 16-32 % increase in docetaxel Cmax. Caution is recommended when sorafenib is \nco-administered with docetaxel (see section 4.4). \n \nCombination with other agents \n \nNeomycin \nCo-administration of neomycin, a non-systemic antimicrobial agent used to eradicate gastrointestinal \nflora, interferes with the enterohepatic recycling of sorafenib (see section 5.2, Metabolism and \nElimination), resulting in decreased sorafenib exposure. In healthy volunteers treated with a 5-day \nregimen of neomycin the average exposure to sorafenib decreased by 54%. Effects of other antibiotics \nhave not been studied, but will likely depend on their ability to interfere with microorganisms with \nglucuronidase activity. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of sorafenib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity including malformations (see section 5.3). In rats, sorafenib and its metabolites \nwere demonstrated to cross the placenta and sorafenib is anticipated to cause harmful effects on the \nfoetus. Sorafenib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after careful \nconsideration of the needs of the mother and the risk to the foetus. \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment.  \n \nLactation \n \nIt is not known whether sorafenib is excreted in human milk. In animals, sorafenib and/or its \nmetabolites were excreted in milk. Because sorafenib could harm infant growth and development (see \nsection 5.3), women must not breast-feed during sorafenib treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nResults from animal studies further indicate that sorafenib can impair male and female fertility (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. There is no \nevidence that sorafenib affects the ability to drive or to operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe most important serious adverse reactions were myocardial infarction/ischaemia, gastrointestinal \nperforation, drug induced hepatitis, haemorrhage, and hypertension/hypertensive crisis. \n \nThe most common adverse reactions were diarrhoea, fatigue, alopecia, infection, hand foot skin \nreaction (corresponds to palmar plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome in MedDRA) and rash. \n \nAdverse reactions reported in multiple clinical trials or through post-marketing use are listed below in \ntable 1, by system organ class (in MedDRA) and frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common \n(\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), \nnot known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: All adverse reactions reported in patients in multiple clinical trials or through post-\nmarketing use \n \nSystem \norgan class \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare \n \n\nNot known \n\nInfections \nand \ninfestations \n\ninfection folliculitis    \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nlymphopenia leucopenia \n\nneutropenia \n\nanaemia \n\nthrombocytope-\nnia \n\n   \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n  hypersensitivity \nreactions \n(including skin \nreactions and \nurticaria) \n\nanaphylactic \nreaction \n\nangioedema   \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism   \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\nanorexia \n\nhypo-\nphosphataemia \n\nhypocalcaemia \n\nhypokalaemia \n\nhyponatraemia \n\nhypoglycaemia \n\ndehydration   \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n depression    \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem \norgan class \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare \n \n\nNot known \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n peripheral \nsensory \nneuropathy \n\ndysgeusia  \n\n \n\nreversible \nposterior \nleukoencephalo-\npathy* \n \n\n encephalo-\npathy\u00b0 \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n tinnitus    \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n congestive heart \nfailure* \n\nmyocardial \nischaemia and \ninfarction* \n\n QT \nprolongation \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nhaemorrhage \n(inc. \ngastrointestinal*, \nrespiratory tract* \nand cerebral \nhaemorrhage*) \n\nhypertension \n\nflushing hypertensive \ncrisis* \n\n aneurysms and \nartery \ndissections \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n rhinorrhoea \n\ndysphonia \n\ninterstitial lung \ndisease-like \nevents* \n(pneumonitis, \nradiation \npneumonitis, \nacute \nrespiratory \ndistress, etc. ) \n\n  \n\nGastro-\nintestinal \ndisorders \n\ndiarrhoea \n\nnausea \n\nvomiting \n\nconstipation \n\nstomatitis \n(including dry \nmouth and \nglossodynia) \n\ndyspepsia \n\ndysphagia \n\ngastro \noesophageal \nreflux disease \n\npancreatitis \n\ngastritis \n\ngastrointestinal \nperforations* \n\n  \n\nHepatobi-\nliary \ndisorders \n\n  increase in \nbilirubin and \njaundice, \ncholecystitis, \ncholangitis \n\ndrug induced \nhepatitis* \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSystem \norgan class \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare \n \n\nNot known \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\ndry skin \n\nrash \n\nalopecia \n\nhand foot skin \nreaction** \n\nerythema  \n\npruritus \n\nkeratoacan-\nthoma/ \nsquamous cell \ncancer of the \nskin \n\ndermatitis \nexfoliative \n\nacne \n\nskin \ndesquamation \n\nhyperkeratosis \n\neczema \n\nerythema \nmultiforme  \n\nradiation recall \ndermatitis \nStevens-\nJohnson \nsyndrome \nleucocyto-\nclastic \nvasculitis \ntoxic epidermal \nnecrolysis* \n\n \n\nMusculo-\nskeletal and \nconnective \ntissue \ndisorders \n\narthralgia myalgia \n\nmuscle spasms \n\n rhabdomyolysis  \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n renal failure \n\nproteinuria \n\n nephrotic \nsyndrome \n\n \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast \ndisorders \n\n erectile \ndysfunction \n\ngynaecomastia   \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadminis-\ntration site \nconditions \n\nfatigue \n\npain (including \nmouth, \nabdominal, \nbone, tumour \npain and \nheadache) \n\nfever \n\nasthenia \n\ninfluenza like \nillness \n\nmucosal \ninflammation \n\n   \n\nInvestiga-\ntions \n\nweight \ndecreased \n\nincreased \namylase  \n\nincreased lipase  \n\ntransient \nincrease in \ntransaminases  \n\ntransient \nincrease in \nblood alkaline \nphosphatase \n\nINR abnormal, \nprothrombin \nlevel abnormal \n\n  \n\n*  The adverse reactions may have a life-threatening or fatal outcome. Such events are either \nuncommon or less frequent than uncommon. \n\n**  Hand foot skin reaction corresponds to palmar plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome in \nMedDRA. \n\n\u00b0  Cases have been reported in the post marketing setting. \n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nFurther information on selected adverse drug reactions \n \nCongestive heart failure \nIn company sponsored clinical trials congestive heart failure was reported as an adverse event in 1.9% \nof patients treated with sorafenib (N= 2276). In study 11213 (RCC) adverse events consistent with \ncongestive heart failure were reported in 1.7% of patients treated with sorafenib and 0.7% receiving \nplacebo. In study 100554 (HCC), 0.99% of those treated with sorafenib and 1.1% receiving placebo \nwere reported with these events. \n \nAdditional information on special populations \nIn clinical trials, certain adverse drug reactions such as hand foot skin reaction, diarrhoea, alopecia, \nweight decrease, hypertension, hypocalcaemia, and keratoacanthoma/squamous cell carcinoma of skin \noccurred at a substantially higher frequency in patients with differentiated thyroid compared to \npatients in the renal cell or hepatocellular carcinoma studies. \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities in HCC (study 3) and RCC (study 1) patients \n \nIncreased lipase and amylase were very commonly reported. CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevations \noccurred in 11 % and 9 % of patients in the sorafenib group in study 1 (RCC) and study 3 (HCC), \nrespectively, compared to 7 % and 9 % of patients in the placebo group. CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 amylase \nelevations were reported in 1 % and 2 % of patients in the sorafenib group in study 1 and study 3, \nrespectively, compared to 3 % of patients in each placebo group. Clinical pancreatitis was reported in \n2 of 451 sorafenib treated patients (CTCAE Grade 4) in study 1, 1 of 297 sorafenib treated patients in \nstudy 3 (CTCAE Grade 2), and 1 of 451 patients (CTCAE Grade 2) in the placebo group in study 1. \n \nHypophosphataemia was a very common laboratory finding, observed in 45 % and 35 % of sorafenib \ntreated patients compared to 12 % and 11 % of placebo patients in study 1 and study 3, respectively. \nCTCAE Grade 3 hypophosphataemia (1 \u2013 2 mg/dl) in study 1 occurred in 13 % of sorafenib treated \npatients and 3 % of patients in the placebo group, in study 3 in 11 % of sorafenib treated patients and \n2 % of patients in the placebo group. There were no cases of CTCAE Grade 4 hypophosphataemia \n(< 1 mg/dl) reported in either sorafenib or placebo patients in study 1, and 1 case in the placebo group \nin study 3. The aetiology of hypophosphataemia associated with sorafenib is not known. \n \nCTCAE Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities occurring in \u2265 5 % of sorafenib treated patients \nincluded lymphopenia and neutropenia. \n \nHypocalcaemia was reported in 12% and 26.5% of sorafenib treated patients compared to 7.5% and \n14.8% of placebo patients in study 1 and study 3, respectively. Most reports of hypocalcaemia were \nlow grade (CTCAE Grade 1 and 2). CTCAE grade 3 hypocalcaemia (6.0 \u2013 7.0 mg /dL) occurred in \n1.1% and 1.8% of sorafenib treated patients and 0.2% and 1.1% of patients in the placebo group, and \nCTCAE grade 4 hypocalcaemia (< 6.0 mg/dL) occurred in 1.1% and 0.4% of sorafenib treated patients \nand 0.5% and 0% of patients in the placebo group in study 1 and 3, respectively. The aetiology of \nhypocalcaemia associated with sorafenib is not known. \n \nIn studies 1 and 3 decreased potassium was observed in 5.4% and 9.5% of sorafenib-treated patients \ncompared to 0.7% and 5.9% of placebo patients, respectively. Most reports of hypokalaemia were low \ngrade (CTCAE Grade 1). In these studies CTCAE Grade 3 hypokalaemia occurred in 1.1% and 0.4% \nof sorafenib treated patients and 0.2% and 0.7% of patients in the placebo group. There were no \nreports of hypokalaemia CTCAE grade 4. \n \nLaboratory test abnormalities in DTC patients (study 5) \n \nHypocalcaemia was reported in 35.7% of sorafenib treated patients compared to 11.0% of placebo \npatients. Most reports of hypocalcaemia were low grade. CTCAE grade 3 hypocalcaemia occurred in \n6.8% of sorafenib treated patients and 1.9% of patients in the placebo group, and CTCAE grade 4 \nhypocalcaemia occurred in 3.4% of sorafenib treated patients and 1.0% of patients in the placebo \ngroup. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nOther clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities observed in the study 5 are shown in table 2. \n \nTable 2: Treatment-emergent laboratory test abnormalities reported in DTC  patient (study 5) \ndouble blind period \n \n\nLaboratory parameter,  \n(in % of samples \n\ninvestigated) \n\nSorafenib N=207 Placebo N=209 \nAll \n\nGrades* \nGrade \n\n3* \nGrade \n\n4* \nAll \n\nGrades* \nGrade \n\n3* \nGrade \n\n4* \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nAnemia 30.9 0.5 0 23.4 0.5 0 \nThrombocytopenia 18.4 0 0 9.6 0 0 \nNeutropenia  19.8 0.5 0.5 12 0 0 \nLymphopenia  42 9.7 0.5 25.8 5.3 0 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nHypokalemia 17.9 1.9 0 2.4 0 0 \n\nHypophosphatemia** 19.3 12.6 0 2.4 1.4 0 \nHepatobiliary disorders \nBilirubin increased  8.7 0 0 4.8 0 0 \nALT increased 58.9 3.4 1.0 24.4 0 0 \nAST increased 53.6 1.0 1.0 14.8 0 0 \nInvestigations  \nAmylase increased 12.6 2.4 1.4 6.2 0 1.0 \nLipase increased 11.1 2.4 0 2.9 0.5 0 \n* Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0  \n** The aetiology of hypophosphatemia associated with sorafenib is not known. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific treatment for sorafenib overdose. The highest dose of sorafenib studied clinically \nis 800 mg twice daily. The adverse events observed at this dose were primarily diarrhoea and \ndermatological events. In the event of suspected overdose sorafenib should be withheld and supportive \ncare instituted where necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE05 \n \nSorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor which has demonstrated both anti-proliferative and anti-\nangiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nSorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that decreases tumour cell proliferation in vitro. Sorafenib inhibits \ntumour growth of a broad spectrum of human tumour xenografts in athymic mice accompanied by a \nreduction of tumour angiogenesis. Sorafenib inhibits the activity of targets present in the tumour cell \n(CRAF, BRAF, V600E BRAF, c-KIT, and FLT-3) and in the tumour vasculature (CRAF, VEGFR-2, \nVEGFR-3, and PDGFR-\u00df). RAF kinases are serine/threonine kinases, whereas  \nc-KIT, FLT-3, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-\u00df are receptor tyrosine kinases.  \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe clinical safety and efficacy of sorafenib have been studied in patients with hepatocellular \ncarcinoma (HCC), in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and in patients with \ndifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). \n \nHepatocellular carcinoma \n \nStudy 3 (study 100554) was a Phase III, international, multi-centre, randomised, double blind, \nplacebo-controlled study in 602 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Demographics and baseline \ndisease characteristics were comparable between the sorafenib and the placebo group with regard to \nECOG status (status 0: 54 % vs. 54 %; status 1: 38 % vs. 39 %; status 2: 8 % vs. 7 %), TNM stage \n(stage I: <1 % vs. <1 %; stage II: 10.4 % vs. 8.3 %; stage III: 37.8 % vs. 43.6 %; stage IV: 50.8 % \nvs. 46.9 %), and BCLC stage (stage B: 18.1 % vs. 16.8 %; stage C: 81.6 % vs. 83.2 %; stage D: < 1 % \nvs. 0 %). \n \nThe study was stopped after a planned interim analysis of OS had crossed the prespecified efficacy \nboundary. This OS analysis showed a statistically significant advantage for sorafenib over placebo for \nOS (HR: 0.69, p = 0.00058, see table 3).  \n \nThere are limited data from this study in patients with Child Pugh B liver impairment and only one \npatient with Child Pugh C had been included. \n \nTable 3: Efficacy results from study 3 (study 100554) in hepatocellular carcinoma \n \nEfficacy Parameter Sorafenib \n\n(N=299) \nPlacebo \n(N=303) \n\nP-value HR \n(95% CI) \n\nOverall Survival (OS) \n[median, weeks (95% \nCI)] \n\n46.3 \n(40.9, 57.9) \n\n34.4 \n(29.4, 39.4) \n\n0.00058* \n \n\n0.69 \n(0.55, 0.87) \n\nTime to Progression \n(TTP) [median, weeks \n(95% CI)]** \n\n24.0 \n(18.0, 30.0) \n\n12.3 \n(11.7, 17.1) \n\n0.000007 0.58 \n(0.45, 0.74) \n\nCI=Confidence interval, HR=Hazard ratio (sorafenib over placebo) \n* statistically significant as the p-value was below the prespecified O\u2019Brien Fleming stopping \n\nboundary of 0.0077 \n** independent radiological review \n \nA second Phase III, international, multi-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study \n(Study 4, 11849) evaluated the clinical benefit of sorafenib in 226 patients with advanced \nhepatocellular carcinoma. This study, conducted in China, Korea and Taiwan confirmed the findings \nof Study 3 with respect to the favourable benefit-risk profile of sorafenib (HR (OS): 0.68, \np = 0.01414). \n \nIn the pre-specified stratification factors (ECOG status, presence or absence of macroscopic vascular \ninvasion and/or extrahepatic tumour spread) of both Study 3 and 4, the HR consistently favoured \nsorafenib over placebo. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that patients with distant metastases \nat baseline derived a less pronounced treatment effect. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nRenal cell carcinoma \n \nThe safety and efficacy of sorafenib in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were \ninvestigated in two clinical studies: \n \nStudy 1 (study 11213) was a Phase III, multi-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled \nstudy in 903 patients. Only patients with clear cell renal carcinoma and low and intermediate risk \nMSKCC (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) were included. The primary endpoints were \noverall survival and progression-free survival (PFS).  \nApproximately half of the patients had an ECOG performance status of 0, and half of the patients were \nin the low risk MSKCC prognostic group.  \nPFS was evaluated by blinded independent radiological review using RECIST criteria. The PFS \nanalysis was conducted at 342 events in 769 patients. The median PFS was 167 days for patients \nrandomised to sorafenib compared to 84 days for placebo patients (HR = 0.44; 95 % CI: 0.35 - 0.55; \np < 0.000001). Age, MSKCC prognostic group, ECOG PS and prior therapy did not affect the \ntreatment effect size.  \n \nAn interim analysis (second interim analysis) for overall survival was conducted at 367 deaths in 903 \npatients. The nominal alpha value for this analysis was 0.0094. The median survival was 19.3 months \nfor patients randomised to sorafenib compared to 15.9 months for placebo patients (HR = 0.77; 95 % \nCI:  0.63 - 0.95; p = 0.015). At the time of this analysis, about 200 patients had crossed-over to \nsorafenib from the placebo group.  \n \nStudy 2 was a Phase II, discontinuation study in patients with metastatic malignancies, including RCC. \nPatients with stable disease on therapy with sorafenib were randomised to placebo or continued \nsorafenib therapy. Progression-free survival in patients with RCC was significantly longer in the \nsorafenib group (163 days) than in the placebo group (41 days) (p = 0.0001, HR = 0.29). \n \nDifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) \n \nStudy 5 (study 14295) was a Phase III, international, multi-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo-\ncontrolled trial in 417 patients with locally advanced or metastatic DTC refractory to radioactive \niodine. Progression-free survival (PFS) as evaluated by a blinded independent radiological review \nusing RECIST criteria was the primary endpoint of the study. Secondary endpoints included overall \nsurvival (OS), tumour response rate and duration of response. Following progression, patients were \nallowed to receive open label sorafenib.  \nPatients were included in the study if they experienced progression within 14 months of enrollment \nand had DTC refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI). DTC refractory to RAI was defined as having a \nlesion without iodine uptake on a RAI scan, or receiving cumulative RAI \u2265 22.2  GBq, or experiencing \na progression after a RAI treatment within 16 months of enrollment or after two RAI treatments within \n16 months of each other.  \n \nBaseline demographics and patient characteristics were well balanced for both treatment groups. \nMetastases were present in the lungs in 86%, lymph node in 51% and bone in 27% of the patients. The \nmedian delivered cumulative radioactive iodine activity before enrollment was approximately 14.8  \nGBq. Majority of patients had papillary carcinoma (56.8%), followed by follicular (25.4%) and poorly \ndifferentiated carcinoma (9.6%). \n \nMedian PFS time was 10.8 months in the sorafenib group compared to 5.8 months in the placebo \ngroup (HR=0.587; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.454, 0.758; one-sided p <0.0001).  \nThe effect of sorafenib on PFS was consistent independent of geographic region, age above or below \n60 years, gender, histological subtype, and presence or absence of bone metastasis.  \n \nIn an overall survival analysis conducted 9 months after the data cut-off for the final PFS analysis \nthere was no statically significant difference in overall survival between the treatment groups \n(HR=0.884; 95% CI: 0.633, 1.236, one-sided p value of 0.236). The median OS was not reached in \n\n\n\n16 \n\nthe sorafenib arm and was 36.5 months in the placebo arm. One hundred fifty seven (75%) patients \nrandomised to placebo and 61 (30%) patients randomised to sorafenib received open-label sorafenib. \n \nThe median duration of therapy in the double-blind period was 46 weeks (range 0.3-135) for patients \nreceiving sorafenib and 28 weeks (range 1.7\u2013132) for patients receiving placebo. \n \nNo complete response (CR) according to RECIST was observed. The overall response rate (CR + \npartial response (PR) per independent radiological assessment was higher in the sorafenib group (24 \npatients, 12.2%) than in the placebo group (1 patient, 0.5%), one-sided p<0.0001. The median duration \nof response was 309 days (95% CI: 226,505 days) in sorafenib treated patients who experienced a PR. \n \nA post-hoc subgroup analysis by maximum tumour size showed a treatment effect for PFS in favour of \nsorafenib over placebo for patients with maximum tumour size of 1.5 cm or larger (HR 0.54  (95% CI: \n0.41 - 0.71)) whereas a numerically lower effect was reported in patients with a maximum tumour size \nof less than 1.5 cm (HR 0.87 (95% CI: 0.40 - 1.89). \n \nA post-hoc subgroup analysis by thyroid carcinoma symptoms at baseline showed a treatment effect \nfor PFS in favour of sorafenib over placebo for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The HR \nof progression free survival was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21 - 0.72) for patients with symptoms at baseline and \n0.60 (95% CI: 0.45 - 0.81) for patients without symptoms at baseline. \n \nQT interval prolongation \n \nIn a clinical pharmacology study, QT/QTc measurements were recorded in 31 patients at baseline \n(pre-treatment) and post-treatment. After one 28-day treatment cycle, at the time of maximum \nconcentration of sorafenib, QTcB was prolonged by 4 \u00b119 msec and QTcF by 9 \u00b118 msec, as \ncompared to placebo treatment at baseline. No subject showed a QTcB or QTcF >500 msec during the \npost-treatment ECG monitoring (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies, in all \nsubsets of the paediatric population, in kidney and renal pelvis carcinoma (excluding nephroblastoma, \nnephroblastomatosis, clear cell sarcoma, mesoblastic nephroma, renal medullary carcinoma and \nrhabdoid tumour of the kidney) and liver and intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma (excluding \nhepatoblastoma) and differentiated thyroid carcinoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nAfter administration of sorafenib tablets the mean relative bioavailability is 38 - 49 % when compared \nto an oral solution. The absolute bioavailability is not known. Following oral administration sorafenib \nreaches peak plasma concentrations in approximately 3 hours. When given with a high-fat meal \nsorafenib absorption was reduced by 30 % compared to administration in the fasted state.  \nMean Cmax and AUC increased less than proportionally beyond doses of 400 mg administered twice \ndaily. In vitro binding of sorafenib to human plasma proteins is 99.5 %. \nMultiple dosing of sorafenib for 7 days resulted in a 2.5- to 7-fold accumulation compared to single \ndose administration. Steady state plasma sorafenib concentrations are achieved within 7 days, with a \npeak to trough ratio of mean concentrations of less than 2. \n \nThe steady-state concentrations of sorafenib administered at 400 mg twice daily were evaluated in \nDTC, RCC and HCC patients. The highest mean concentration was observed in DTC patients \n(approximately twice that observed in patients with RCC and HCC), though variability was high for \nall tumour types. The reason for the increased concentration in DTC patients is unknown. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nThe elimination half-life of sorafenib is approximately 25 - 48 hours. Sorafenib is metabolised \nprimarily in the liver and undergoes oxidative metabolism, mediated by CYP 3A4, as well as \nglucuronidation mediated by UGT1A9. Sorafenib conjugates may be cleaved in the gastrointestinal \ntract by bacterial glucuronidase activity, allowing reabsorption of unconjugated active substance. Co-\nadministration of neomycin has been shown to interfere with this process, decreasing the mean \nbioavailability of sorafenib by 54%. \n \nSorafenib accounts for approximately 70 - 85 % of the circulating analytes in plasma at steady state. \nEight metabolites of sorafenib have been identified, of which five have been detected in plasma. The \nmain circulating metabolite of sorafenib in plasma, the pyridine N-oxide, shows in vitro potency \nsimilar to that of sorafenib. This metabolite comprises approximately 9 - 16 % of circulating analytes \nat steady state. \n \nFollowing oral administration of a 100 mg dose of a solution formulation of sorafenib, 96 % of the \ndose was recovered within 14 days, with 77 % of the dose excreted in faeces, and 19 % of the dose \nexcreted in urine as glucuronidated metabolites. Unchanged sorafenib, accounting for 51 % of the \ndose, was found in faeces but not in urine, indicating that biliary excretion of unchanged active \nsubstance might contribute to the elimination of sorafenib. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAnalyses of demographic data suggest that there is no relationship between pharmacokinetics and age \n(up to 65 years), gender or body weight. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in paediatric patients.  \n \nRace \n \nThere are no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics between Caucasian and Asian \nsubjects. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn four Phase I clinical trials, steady state exposure to sorafenib was similar in patients with mild or \nmoderate renal impairment compared to the exposures in patients with normal renal function. In a \nclinical pharmacology study (single dose of 400 mg sorafenib), no relationship was observed between \nsorafenib exposure and renal function in subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate or severe \nrenal impairment. No data is available in patients requiring dialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with Child-Pugh A or B (mild to moderate) hepatic \nimpairment, exposure values were comparable and within the range observed in patients without \nhepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib in Child-Pugh A and B non-HCC \npatients were similar to the PK in healthy volunteers. There are no data for patients with Child-Pugh C \n(severe) hepatic impairment. Sorafenib is mainly eliminated via the liver, and exposure might be \nincreased in this patient population. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe preclinical safety profile of sorafenib was assessed in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. \nRepeat-dose toxicity studies revealed changes (degenerations and regenerations) in various organs at \nexposures below the anticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC comparisons). \n\n\n\n18 \n\nAfter repeated dosing to young and growing dogs effects on bone and teeth were observed at \nexposures below the clinical exposure. Changes consisted in irregular thickening of the femoral \ngrowth plate, hypocellularity of the bone marrow next to the altered growth plate and alterations of the \ndentin composition. Similar effects were not induced in adult dogs. \n \nThe standard program of genotoxicity studies was conducted and positive results were obtained as an \nincrease in structural chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro mammalian cell assay (Chinese hamster \novary) for clastogenicity in the presence of metabolic activation was seen. Sorafenib was not \ngenotoxic in the Ames test or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. One intermediate in the \nmanufacturing process, which is also present in the final active substance (< 0.15 %), was positive for \nmutagenesis in an in vitro bacterial cell assay (Ames test). Furthermore, the sorafenib batch tested in \nthe standard genotoxicity battery included 0.34 % PAPE. \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with sorafenib. \n \nNo specific studies with sorafenib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility. \nAn adverse effect on male and female fertility can however be expected because repeat-dose studies in \nanimals have shown changes in male and female reproductive organs at exposures below the \nanticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC). Typical changes consisted of signs of degeneration and \nretardation in testes, epididymides, prostate, and seminal vesicles of rats. Female rats showed central \nnecrosis of the corpora lutea and arrested follicular development in the ovaries. Dogs showed tubular \ndegeneration in the testes and oligospermia. \n \nSorafenib has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits at \nexposures below the clinical exposure. Observed effects included decreases in maternal and foetal \nbody weights, an increased number of foetal resorptions and an increased number of external and \nvisceral malformations.  \n \nEnvironmental Risk assessment studies have shown that sorafenib tosylate has the potential to be \npersistent, bioaccumulative and toxic to the environment. Environmental Risk Assessment information \nis available in the EPAR of this medicine (see section 6.6). \n \n \n6.

your doctor straight away if you (or anyone else) have taken more than your prescribed dose. taking too much nexavar makes side effects more likely or more severe, especially diarrhoea and skin
