CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult and paediatric (in any age range) patients with confirmed diagnosis of hereditary \ntyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNitisinone treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of \nHT-1 patients. \n \nPosology \nTreatment of all genotypes of the disease should be initiated as early as possible to increase overall \nsurvival and avoid complications such as liver failure, liver cancer and renal disease. Adjunct to the \nnitisinone treatment, a diet deficient in phenylalanine and tyrosine is required and should be followed \nby monitoring of plasma amino acids (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe recommended initial daily dose in the paediatric and adult population is 1 mg/kg body weight \nadministered orally. The dose of nitisinone should be adjusted individually. It is recommended to \nadminister the dose once daily. However, due to the limited data in patients with body weight <20 kg, \nit is recommended to divide the total daily dose into two daily administrations in this patient \npopulation. \n \nDose adjustment \nDuring regular monitoring, it is appropriate to follow urine succinylacetone, liver function test values \nand alpha-fetoprotein levels (see section 4.4). If urine succinylacetone is still detectable one month \nafter the start of nitisinone treatment, the nitisinone dose should be increased to 1.5 mg/kg body \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nweight/day. A dose of 2 mg/kg body weight/day may be needed based on the evaluation of all \nbiochemical parameters. This dose should be considered as a maximal dose for all patients. \nIf the biochemical response is satisfactory, the dose should be adjusted only according to body weight \ngain. \n \nHowever, in addition to the tests above, during the initiation of therapy, switch from twice daily to \nonce daily dosing or if there is a deterioration, it may be necessary to follow more closely all available \nbiochemical parameters (i.e. plasma succinylacetone, urine 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) and erythrocyte \nporphobilinogen (PBG)-synthase activity).  \n \nSpecial populations \nThere are no specific dose recommendations for elderly or patients that have renal or hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe dose recommendation in mg/kg body weight is the same in children and adults. \nHowever, due to the limited data in patients with body weight <20 kg, it is recommended to divide the \ntotal daily dose into two daily administrations in this patient population. \n \nMethod of administration \nThe capsule may be opened and the content suspended in a small amount of water or formula diet \nimmediately before intake. \n \nOrfadin is also available as a 4 mg/ml oral suspension for paediatric patients who have difficulties \nswallowing capsules. \n \nIt is recommended that if nitisinone treatment is initiated with food, this should be maintained on a \nroutine basis, see section 4.5. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nMothers receiving nitisinone must not breast-feed (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMonitoring of plasma tyrosine levels \nIt is recommended that a slit-lamp examination of the eyes is performed before initiation of nitisinone \ntreatment and thereafter regularly, at least once a year. A patient displaying visual disorders during \ntreatment with nitisinone should without delay be examined by an ophthalmologist. It should be \nestablished that the patient is adhering to his/her dietary regimen and the plasma tyrosine \nconcentration should be measured. A more restricted tyrosine and phenylalanine diet should be \nimplemented in case the plasma tyrosine level is above 500 micromol/l. It is not recommended to \nlower the plasma tyrosine concentration by reduction or discontinuation of nitisinone, since the \nmetabolic defect may result in deterioration of the patient\u2019s clinical condition. \n \nLiver monitoring \nThe liver function should be monitored regularly by liver function tests and liver imaging. It is \nrecommended to also monitor serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations. Increase in serum \nalpha-fetoprotein concentration may be a sign of inadequate treatment. Patients with increasing \nalpha-fetoprotein or signs of nodules in the liver should always be evaluated for hepatic malignancy. \n \nPlatelet and white blood cell (WBC) monitoring \nIt is recommended that platelet and WBC counts are monitored regularly, as a few cases of reversible \nthrombocytopenia and leucopenia were observed during clinical evaluation. \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nMonitoring visits should be performed every 6 months; shorter intervals between visits are \nrecommended in case of adverse events. \n \nConcomitant use with other medicinal products \nNitisinone is a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor. Nitisinone treatment may therefore result in increased \nplasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products metabolized primarily via CYP2C9. \nNitisinone treated patients who are concomitantly treated with medicinal products with a narrow \ntherapeutic window metabolized through CYP2C9, such as warfarin and phenytoin, should be \ncarefully monitored. Dose-adjustment of these co-administered medicinal products may be needed \n(see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNitisinone is metabolised in vitro by CYP 3A4 and dose-adjustment may therefore be needed when \nnitisinone is co-administered with inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme. \n \nBased on data from a clinical interaction study with 80 mg nitisinone at steady-state, nitisinone is a \nmoderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (2.3-fold increase in tolbutamide AUC), therefore nitisinone treatment \nmay result in increased plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products metabolized \nprimarily via CYP2C9 (see section 4.4).  \nNitisinone is a weak inducer of CYP2E1 (30% decrease in chlorzoxazone AUC) and a weak inhibitor \nof OAT1 and OAT3 (1.7-fold increase in AUC of furosemide), whereas nitisinone did not inhibit \nCYP2D6 (see section 5.2). \n \nNo formal food interactions studies have been performed with Orfadin hard capsules. However, \nnitisinone has been co-administered with food during the generation of efficacy and safety data. \nTherefore, it is recommended that if nitisinone treatment with Orfadin hard capsules is initiated with \nfood, this should be maintained on a routine basis, see section 4.2. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of nitisinone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Orfadin \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment \nwith nitisinone. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether nitisinone is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nadverse postnatal effects via exposure of nitisinone in milk. Therefore, mothers receiving nitisinone \nmust not breast-feed, since a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded (see sections 4.3 and 5.3).  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on nitisinone affecting fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOrfadin has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions involving the \neyes (see section 4.8) can affect the vision. If the vision is affected the patient should not drive or use \nmachines until the event has subsided. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nBy its mode of action, nitisinone increases tyrosine levels in all nitisinone treated patients. Eye-related \nadverse reactions, such as conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, keratitis, photophobia, and eye pain, related \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nto elevated tyrosine levels are therefore common. Other common adverse reactions include \nthrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and granulocytopenia. Exfoliative dermatitis may occur uncommonly. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions listed below by MedDRA system organ class and absolute frequency, are based \non data from a clinical trial and post-marketing use. Frequency is defined as very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon  Thrombocytopenia, \nleucopenia, granulocytopenia \n\nUncommon  Leukocytosis \nEye disorders Common  Conjunctivitis, corneal \n\nopacity, keratitis, \nphotophobia, eye pain \n\nUncommon Blepharitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon  Exfoliative dermatitis, \nerythematous rash, pruritus \n\nInvestigations Very common  Elevated tyrosine levels \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nNitisinone treatment leads to elevated tyrosine levels. Elevated levels of tyrosine have been associated \nwith eye-related adverse reactions, such as e.g. corneal opacities and hyperkeratotic lesions. \nRestriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the diet should limit the toxicity associated with this type \nof tyrosinemia by lowering tyrosine levels (see section 4.4). \nIn clinical studies, granulocytopenia was only uncommonly severe (<0.5x109/L) and not associated \nwith infections. Adverse reactions affecting the MedDRA system organ class \u2018Blood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\u2019 subsided during continued nitisinone treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety profile is mainly based on the paediatric population since nitisinone treatment should be \nstarted as soon as the diagnosis of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) has been established. From \nclinical study and post marketing data there are no indications that the safety profile is different in \ndifferent subsets of the paediatric population or different from the safety profile in adult patients.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAccidental ingestion of nitisinone by individuals eating normal diets not restricted in tyrosine and \nphenylalanine will result in elevated tyrosine levels. Elevated tyrosine levels have been associated \nwith toxicity to eyes, skin, and the nervous system. Restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the \ndiet should limit toxicity associated with this type of tyrosinemia. No information about specific \ntreatment of overdose is available. \n \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, Various alimentary tract \nand metabolism products, ATC code: A16A X04. \n \nMechanism of action \nThe biochemical defect in hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) is a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate \nhydrolase, which is the final enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway. Nitisinone is a competitive \ninhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme which precedes fumarylacetoacetate \nhydrolase in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in \npatients with HT-1, nitisinone prevents the accumulation of the toxic intermediates maleylacetoacetate \nand fumarylacetoacetate. In patients with HT-1, these intermediates are converted to the toxic \nmetabolites succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate. Succinylacetone inhibits the porphyrin \nsynthesis pathway leading to the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinate.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nNitisinone treatment leads to normalised porphyrin metabolism with normal erythrocyte \nporphobilinogen synthase activity and urine 5-aminolevulinate, decreased urinary excretion of \nsuccinylacetone, increased plasma tyrosine concentration and increased urinary excretion of phenolic \nacids. Available data from a clinical study indicates that in more than 90% of the patients urine \nsuccinylacetone was normalized during the first week of treatment. Succinylacetone should not be \ndetectable in urine or plasma when the nitisinone dose is properly adjusted. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe clinical study was open-labelled and uncontrolled. The dosing frequency in the study was twice \ndaily. Survival probabilities after 2, 4 and 6 years of treatment with nitisinone are summarized in the \ntable below. \n\nNTBC study (N=250) \nAge at start of treatment 2 years 4 years 6 years \n\u2264 2 months 93% 93% 93% \n\u2264 6 months 93% 93% 93% \n> 6 months 96% 95% 95% \nOverall 94% 94% 94% \n\n \nData from a study used as a historical control (van Spronsen et al., 1994) showed the following \nsurvival probability. \n\nAge at onset of symptoms 1 year 2 years \n< 2 months 38% 29% \n> 2-6 months 74% 74% \n> 6 months 96% 96% \n\n \nTreatment with nitisinone was also found to result in reduced risk for the development of \nhepatocellular carcinoma compared to historical data on treatment with dietary restriction alone. It was \nfound that the early initiation of treatment resulted in a further reduced risk for the development of \nhepatocellular carcinoma. \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nThe 2-, 4-, and 6-year probability of no occurrence of HCC during nitisinone treatment for patients \naged 24 months or younger at the start of treatment and for those older than 24 months at the start of \ntreatment is shown in the following table: \n \n\nNTBC study (N=250) \n Number of patients at Probability of no HCC (95% confidence \n\ninterval) at \nstart 2 years 4 years 6 years 2 years 4 years 6 years \n\nAll \npatients \n\n250 155 86 15 98% \n(95; 100) \n\n94%  \n(90; 98) \n\n91%  \n(81; 100) \n\nStart age \n\u2264 24 \nmonths \n\n193 114 61 8 99%  \n(98; 100) \n\n99%  \n(97; 100) \n\n99%  \n(94; 100) \n\nStart age \n> 24 \nmonths \n\n57 41 25 8 92%  \n(84; 100) \n\n82%  \n(70; 95) \n\n75%  \n(56; 95) \n\n \nIn an international survey of patients with HT-1 on treatment with dietary restriction alone, it was \nfound that HCC had been diagnosed in 18% of all patients aged 2 years and above. \n \nA study to evaluate the PK, efficacy and safety of once daily dosing compared to twice daily dosing \nwas performed in 19 patients with HT-1. There were no clinically important differences in AEs or \nother safety assessments between once and twice daily dosing. No patient had detectable \nsuccinylacetone (SA) levels at the end of the once-daily treatment period. The study indicates that \nonce daily administration is safe and efficacious across all ages of patients. Data is, however, limited \nin patients with body weight <20 kg. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFormal absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination studies have not been performed with \nnitisinone. In 10 healthy male volunteers, after administration of a single dose of nitisinone capsules \n(1 mg/kg body weight) the terminal half-life (median) of nitisinone in plasma was 54 hours (ranging \nfrom 39 to 86 hours). A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been conducted on a group of \n207 HT-1 patients. The clearance and half-life were determined to be 0.0956 l/kg body weight/day and \n52.1 hours respectively.  \n \nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed P450 enzymes have shown \nlimited CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. \n \nBased on data from a clinical interaction study with 80 mg nitisinone at steady-state, nitisinone caused \na 2.3-fold increase in AUC\u221e of the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide, which is indicative of a moderate \ninhibition of CYP2C9. Nitisinone caused an approximate 30% decrease in chlorzoxazone AUC\u221e, \nindicative of a weak induction of CYP2E1. Nitisinone does not inhibit CYP2D6 since metoprolol \nAUC\u221e was not affected by the administration of nitisinone. Furosemide AUC\u221e was increased 1.7-fold, \nindicating a weak inhibition of OAT1/OAT3 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nBased on in vitro studies, nitisinone is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, 2C19 or 3A4-mediated \nmetabolism or to induce CYP1A2, 2B6 or 3A4/5. Nitisinone is not expected to inhibit P-gp, BCRP or \nOCT2-mediated transport. Nitisinone plasma concentration reached in clinical setting is not expected \nto inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3 mediated transport. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNitisinone has shown embryo-foetal toxicity in the mouse and rabbit at clinically relevant dose levels. \nIn the rabbit, nitisinone induced a dose-related increase in malformations (umbilical hernia and \ngastroschisis) from a dose level 2.5-fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose \n(2 mg/kg/day). \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nA pre- and postnatal development study in the mouse showed statistically significantly reduced pup \nsurvival and pup growth during the weaning period at dose levels 125- and 25-fold higher, \nrespectively, than the maximum recommended human dose, with a trend toward a negative effect on \npup survival starting from the dose of 5 mg/kg/day. In rats, exposure via milk resulted in reduced \nmean pup weight and corneal lesions.  \n \nNo mutagenic but a weak clastogenic activity was observed in in vitro studies. There was no evidence \nof in vivo genotoxicity (mouse micronucleus assay and mouse liver unscheduled DNA synthesis \nassay). Nitisinone did not show carcinogenic potential in a 26-week carcinogenicity study in \ntransgenic mice (TgrasH2). \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult and paediatric (in any age range) patients with confirmed diagnosis of hereditary \ntyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNitisinone treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of \nHT-1 patients. \n \nPosology \nTreatment of all genotypes of the disease should be initiated as early as possible to increase overall \nsurvival and avoid complications such as liver failure, liver cancer and renal disease. Adjunct to the \nnitisinone treatment, a diet deficient in phenylalanine and tyrosine is required and should be followed \nby monitoring of plasma amino acids (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe recommended initial daily dose in the paediatric and adult population is 1 mg/kg body weight \nadministered orally. The dose of nitisinone should be adjusted individually. It is recommended to \nadminister the dose once daily. However, due to the limited data in patients with body weight <20 kg, \nit is recommended to divide the total daily dose into two daily administrations in this patient \npopulation. \n \nDose adjustment \nDuring regular monitoring, it is appropriate to follow urine succinylacetone, liver function test values \nand alpha-fetoprotein levels (see section 4.4). If urine succinylacetone is still detectable one month \nafter the start of nitisinone treatment, the nitisinone dose should be increased to 1.5 mg/kg body \nweight/day. A dose of 2 mg/kg body weight/day may be needed based on the evaluation of all \nbiochemical parameters. This dose should be considered as a maximal dose for all patients. \nIf the biochemical response is satisfactory, the dose should be adjusted only according to body weight \ngain. \n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nHowever, in addition to the tests above, during the initiation of therapy, switch from twice daily to \nonce daily dosing or if there is a deterioration, it may be necessary to follow more closely all available \nbiochemical parameters (i.e. plasma succinylacetone, urine 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) and erythrocyte \nporphobilinogen (PBG)-synthase activity).  \n \nSpecial populations \nThere are no specific dose recommendations for elderly or patients that have renal or hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe dose recommendation in mg/kg body weight is the same in children and adults. \nHowever, due to the limited data in patients with body weight <20 kg, it is recommended to divide the \ntotal daily dose into two daily administrations in this patient population. \n \nMethod of administration \nThe suspension is administered in the patient\u2019s mouth with an oral syringe without dilution. A 1 ml, \n3 ml and 5 ml oral syringes are included in the pack to measure the dose in ml in accordance with the \nprescribed posology.

Before re-dispersion, the medicinal \nproduct may appear as a solid cake with a slightly opalescent supernatant. The dose should be \nwithdrawn and administered immediately after re-dispersion. \nIt is important to carefully follow the instructions given in section 6.6 for preparation and \nadministration of the dose, in order to ensure the dosing accuracy. \nIt is recommended that the healthcare professional advises the patient or care giver how to use the oral \nsyringes to ensure that the correct volume is administered and that the prescription is given in ml. \n \nOrfadin is also available in 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg capsules, if considered more suitable for the \npatient. \n \nIt is recommended that the oral suspension is taken with food, see section 4.5. \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nNo needle, intravenous tubing or any other device for parenteral administration should be attached to \nthe oral syringe. \nOrfadin is for oral use only. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nMothers receiving nitisinone must not breast-feed (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMonitoring of plasma tyrosine levels \nIt is recommended that a slit-lamp examination of the eyes is performed before initiation of nitisinone \ntreatment and thereafter regularly, at least once a year. A patient displaying visual disorders during \ntreatment with nitisinone should without delay be examined by an ophthalmologist. It should be \nestablished that the patient is adhering to his/her dietary regimen and the plasma tyrosine \nconcentration should be measured. A more restricted tyrosine and phenylalanine diet should be \nimplemented in case the plasma tyrosine level is above 500 micromol/l. It is not recommended to \nlower the plasma tyrosine concentration by reduction or discontinuation of nitisinone, since the \nmetabolic defect may result in deterioration of the patient\u2019s clinical condition. \n \nLiver monitoring \nThe liver function should be monitored regularly by liver function tests and liver imaging. It is \nrecommended to also monitor serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations. Increase in serum \nalpha-fetoprotein concentration may be a sign of inadequate treatment. Patients with increasing \nalpha-fetoprotein or signs of nodules in the liver should always be evaluated for hepatic malignancy. \n \nPlatelet and white blood cell (WBC) monitoring \nIt is recommended that platelet and WBC counts are monitored regularly, as a few cases of reversible \nthrombocytopenia and leucopenia were observed during clinical evaluation. \n \nMonitoring visits should be performed every 6 months; shorter intervals between visits are \nrecommended in case of adverse events. \n \nConcomitant use with other medicinal products \nNitisinone is a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor. Nitisinone treatment may therefore result in increased \nplasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products metabolized primarily via CYP2C9. \nNitisinone treated patients who are concomitantly treated with medicinal products with a narrow \ntherapeutic window metabolized through CYP2C9, such as warfarin and phenytoin, should be \ncarefully monitored. Dose-adjustment of these co-administered medicinal products may be needed \n(see section 4.5). \n \nExcipients with known effect: \nGlycerol  \nEach ml contains 500 mg. A dose of 20 ml oral suspension (10 g glycerol) or more may cause \nheadache, stomach upset and diarrhoea. \n \nSodium  \nEach ml contains 0.7 mg (0.03 mmol). \n \nSodium benzoate  \nEach ml contains 1 mg. Increase in bilirubin following its displacement from albumin, caused by \nbenzoic acid and its salts, may increase jaundice in pre-term and full-term jaundiced neonates and \ndevelop into kernicterus (unconjugated bilirubin deposits in the brain tissue). A close monitoring of \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nthe plasma levels of bilirubin in the newborn patient is therefore of great importance. Bilirubin levels \nshould be measured before start of treatment: in case of markedly elevated plasma levels of bilirubin, \nespecially in premature patients with risk factors as acidosis and low albumin level, treatment with an \nappropriately weighed portion of an Orfadin capsule should be considered instead of the oral \nsuspension until the unconjugated bilirubin plasma levels are normalised.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNitisinone is metabolised in vitro by CYP 3A4 and dose-adjustment may therefore be needed when \nnitisinone is co-administered with inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme. \n \nBased on data from a clinical interaction study with 80 mg nitisinone at steady-state, nitisinone is a \nmoderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (2.3-fold increase in tolbutamide AUC), therefore nitisinone treatment \nmay result in increased plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products metabolized \nprimarily via CYP2C9 (see section 4.4). \nNitisinone is a weak inducer of CYP2E1 (30% decrease in chlorzoxazone AUC) and a weak inhibitor \nof OAT1 and OAT3 (1.7-fold increase in AUC of furosemide), whereas nitisinone did not inhibit \nCYP2D6 (see section 5.2). \n \nFood does not influence the bioavailability of nitisinone oral suspension, but intake together with food \ndecreases the absorption rate and consequently leads to lower fluctuations in serum concentrations \nwithin a dosage interval. Therefore, it is recommended that the oral suspension is taken with food, see \nsection 4.2. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of nitisinone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Orfadin \nshould not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment \nwith nitisinone. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether nitisinone is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nadverse postnatal effects via exposure of nitisinone in milk. Therefore, mothers receiving nitisinone \nmust not breast-feed, since a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded (see sections 4.3 and 5.3).  \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on nitisinone affecting fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOrfadin has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions involving the \neyes (see section 4.8) can affect the vision. If the vision is affected the patient should not drive or use \nmachines until the event has subsided. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nBy its mode of action, nitisinone increases tyrosine levels in all nitisinone treated patients. Eye-related \nadverse reactions, such as conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, keratitis, photophobia, and eye pain, related \nto elevated tyrosine levels are therefore common. Other common adverse reactions include \nthrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and granulocytopenia. Exfoliative dermatitis may occur uncommonly. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions listed below by MedDRA system organ class and absolute frequency, are based \non data from a clinical trial and post-marketing use. Frequency is defined as very common (\u22651/10), \n\n\n\n 14 \n\ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nMedDRA system organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon  Thrombocytopenia, \nleucopenia, granulocytopenia \n\nUncommon  Leukocytosis \nEye disorders Common  Conjunctivitis, corneal \n\nopacity, keratitis, \nphotophobia, eye pain \n\nUncommon Blepharitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon  Exfoliative dermatitis, \nerythematous rash, pruritus \n\nInvestigations Very common  Elevated tyrosine levels \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nNitisinone treatment leads to elevated tyrosine levels. Elevated levels of tyrosine have been associated \nwith eye-related adverse reactions, such as e.g. corneal opacities and hyperkeratotic lesions. \nRestriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the diet should limit the toxicity associated with this type \nof tyrosinemia by lowering tyrosine levels (see section 4.4). \nIn clinical studies, granulocytopenia was only uncommonly severe (<0.5x109/L) and not associated \nwith infections. Adverse reactions affecting the MedDRA system organ class \u2018Blood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\u2019 subsided during continued nitisinone treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety profile is mainly based on the paediatric population since nitisinone treatment should be \nstarted as soon as the diagnosis of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) has been established. From \nclinical study and post marketing data there are no indications that the safety profile is different in \ndifferent subsets of the paediatric population or different from the safety profile in adult patients.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAccidental ingestion of nitisinone by individuals eating normal diets not restricted in tyrosine and \nphenylalanine will result in elevated tyrosine levels. Elevated tyrosine levels have been associated \nwith toxicity to eyes, skin, and the nervous system. Restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the \ndiet should limit toxicity associated with this type of tyrosinemia. No information about specific \ntreatment of overdose is available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, Various alimentary tract \nand metabolism products, ATC code: A16A X04. \n \nMechanism of action \nThe biochemical defect in hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) is a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate \nhydrolase, which is the final enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway. Nitisinone is a competitive \n\n\n\n 15 \n\ninhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme which precedes fumarylacetoacetate \nhydrolase in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in \npatients with HT-1, nitisinone prevents the accumulation of the toxic intermediates maleylacetoacetate \nand fumarylacetoacetate. In patients with HT-1, these intermediates are converted to the toxic \nmetabolites succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate. Succinylacetone inhibits the porphyrin \nsynthesis pathway leading to the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinate.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nNitisinone treatment leads to normalised porphyrin metabolism with normal erythrocyte \nporphobilinogen synthase activity and urine 5-aminolevulinate, decreased urinary excretion of \nsuccinylacetone, increased plasma tyrosine concentration and increased urinary excretion of phenolic \nacids. Available data from a clinical study indicates that in more than 90% of the patients urine \nsuccinylacetone was normalized during the first week of treatment. Succinylacetone should not be \ndetectable in urine or plasma when the nitisinone dose is properly adjusted. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe clinical study was open-labelled and uncontrolled. The dosing frequency in the study was twice \ndaily. Survival probabilities after 2, 4 and 6 years of treatment with nitisinone are summarized in the \ntable below. \n\nNTBC study (N=250) \nAge at start of treatment 2 years 4 years 6 years \n\u2264 2 months 93% 93% 93% \n\u2264 6 months 93% 93% 93% \n> 6 months 96% 95% 95% \nOverall 94% 94% 94% \n\n \nData from a study used as a historical control (van Spronsen et al., 1994) showed the following \nsurvival probability. \n\nAge at onset of symptoms 1 year 2 years \n< 2 months 38% 29% \n> 2-6 months 74% 74% \n> 6 months 96% 96% \n\n \nTreatment with nitisinone was also found to result in reduced risk for the development of \nhepatocellular carcinoma compared to historical data on treatment with dietary restriction alone. It was \nfound that the early initiation of treatment resulted in a further reduced risk for the development of \nhepatocellular carcinoma. \n \nThe 2-, 4-, and 6-year probability of no occurrence of HCC during nitisinone treatment for patients \naged 24 months or younger at the start of treatment and for those older than 24 months at the start of \ntreatment is shown in the following table: \n \n\nNTBC study (N=250) \n Number of patients at Probability of no HCC (95% confidence \n\ninterval) at \nstart 2 years 4 years 6 years 2 years 4 years 6 years \n\nAll \npatients \n\n250 155 86 15 98% \n(95; 100) \n\n94%  \n(90; 98) \n\n91%  \n(81; 100) \n\nStart age \n\u2264 24 \nmonths \n\n193 114 61 8 99%  \n(98; 100) \n\n99%  \n(97; 100) \n\n99%  \n(94; 100) \n\nStart age \n> 24 \nmonths \n\n57 41 25 8 92%  \n(84; 100) \n\n82%  \n(70; 95) \n\n75%  \n(56; 95) \n\n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nIn an international survey of patients with HT-1 on treatment with dietary restriction alone, it was \nfound that HCC had been diagnosed in 18% of all patients aged 2 years and above. \n \nA study to evaluate the PK, efficacy and safety of once daily dosing compared to twice daily dosing \nwas performed in 19 patients with HT-1. There were no clinically important differences in AEs or \nother safety assessments between once and twice daily dosing. No patient had detectable \nsuccinylacetone (SA) levels at the end of the once-daily treatment period. The study indicates that \nonce daily administration is safe and efficacious across all ages of patients. Data is, however, limited \nin patients with body weight <20 kg. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFormal absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination studies have not been performed with \nnitisinone. In 10 healthy male volunteers, after administration of a single dose of nitisinone capsules \n(1 mg/kg body weight) the terminal half-life (median) of nitisinone in plasma was 54 hours (ranging \nfrom 39 to 86 hours). A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been conducted on a group of \n207 HT-1 patients. The clearance and half-life were determined to be 0.0956 l/kg body weight/day and \n52.1 hours respectively. \n \nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed P450 enzymes have shown \nlimited CYP3A4 mediated metabolism. \n \nBased on data from a clinical interaction study with 80 mg nitisinone at steady-state, nitisinone caused \na 2.3-fold increase in AUC\u221e of the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide, which is indicative of a moderate \ninhibition of CYP2C9. Nitisinone caused an approximate 30% decrease in chlorzoxazone AUC\u221e, \nindicative of a weak induction of CYP2E1. Nitisinone does not inhibit CYP2D6 since metoprolol \nAUC\u221e was not affected by the administration of nitisinone. Furosemide AUC\u221e was increased 1.7-fold, \nindicating a weak inhibition of OAT1/OAT3 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nBased on in vitro studies, nitisinone is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, 2C19 or 3A4-mediated \nmetabolism or to induce CYP1A2, 2B6 or 3A4/5. Nitisinone is not expected to inhibit P-gp, BCRP or \nOCT2-mediated transport. Nitisinone plasma concentration reached in clinical setting is not expected \nto inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3 mediated transport. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNitisinone has shown embryo-foetal toxicity in the mouse and rabbit at clinically relevant dose levels. \nIn the rabbit, nitisinone induced a dose-related increase in malformations (umbilical hernia and \ngastroschisis) from a dose level 2.5-fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose \n(2 mg/kg/day). \nA pre- and postnatal development study in the mouse showed statistically significantly reduced pup \nsurvival and pup growth during the weaning period at dose levels 125- and 25-fold higher, \nrespectively, than the maximum recommended human dose, with a trend toward a negative effect on \npup survival starting from the dose of 5 mg/kg/day. In rats, exposure via milk resulted in reduced \nmean pup weight and corneal lesions.  \n \nNo mutagenic but a weak clastogenic activity was observed in in vitro studies. There was no evidence \nof in vivo genotoxicity (mouse micronucleus assay and mouse liver unscheduled DNA synthesis \nassay). Nitisinone did not show carcinogenic potential in a 26-week carcinogenicity study in \ntransgenic mice (TgrasH2). \n \n \n\n\n\n 17 \n\n6.

Do not freeze.  \nStore upright. \n \nFor storage conditions after first opening of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \n100 ml brown glass bottle (type III) with a white child-resistant HDPE screw cap with sealing and \ntamper evidence. Each bottle contains 90 ml oral suspension. \nEach pack contains one bottle, one LDPE bottle adapter and 3 polypropylene (PP) oral syringes (1 ml, \n3 ml and 5 ml). \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nRe-dispersing is required before each use by vigorous shaking. Before re-dispersion, the \nmedicinal product may appear as a solid cake with a slightly opalescent supernatant. The dose \nshould be withdrawn and administered immediately after re-dispersion. It is important to \ncarefully follow the instructions given below for preparation and administration of the dose, in \norder to ensure the dosing accuracy. \n \nThree oral syringes (1 ml, 3 ml and 5 ml) are provided for accurate measurement of the \nprescribed dose. It is recommended that the healthcare professional advises the patient or carer \ngiver how to use the oral syringes to ensure that the correct volume is administered. \n \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nHow to prepare a new bottle of medicine for first time use: \n \nBefore taking the first dose, the bottle should be shaken vigorously since during long-term \nstorage the particles will form a solid cake at the bottom of the bottle. \n \n\n        \n  Figure A.               Figure B.       Figure C. \n \n\n1. The bottle should be removed from the refrigerator, and the date when the bottle is removed \nfrom the refrigerator should be noted on the bottle label. \n\n2. The bottle should be shaken vigourously for at least 20 seconds until the solid cake at the \nbottom of the bottle is completely dispersed (Figure A). \n\n3. The child-resistant screw cap should be removed by pushing it down firmly and turning it anti-\nclockwise (Figure B). \n\n4. The open bottle should be placed upright on a table, and the plastic adapter pushed firmly into \nthe neck of the bottle as far as possible (Figure C). The bottle should be closed with the child \nresistant screw cap. \n\n \nFor subsequent dosing see the instructions below \u2018How to prepare a dose of medicine\u2019 \n\n \nHow to prepare a dose of medicine \n \n\n            \n Figure D.       Figure E.    Figure F. \n \n\n1. The bottle should be shaken vigourously for at least 5 seconds (Figure D).  \n2. Immediately thereafter, the bottle should be opened by removing the child-resistant screw cap. \n3. The plunger inside the oral syringe should be pushed fully down. \n4. The bottle should be kept in an upright position and the oral syringe inserted firmly into the \n\nhole of the adaptor, at the top of the bottle (Figure E). \n5. The bottle should be turned carefully upside down with the oral syringe in place (Figure F). \n6. In order to withdraw the prescribed dose (ml), the plunger should be pulled down slowly until \n\nthe top edge of the black ring is exactly level with the line marking the dose (Figure F). If any \nair bubbles are observed inside the filled oral syringe, the plunger should be pushed back up \nuntil the air bubbles are expelled. Then the plunger should be pulled down again until the top \nedge of the black ring is exactly level with the line marking the dose. \n\n7. The bottle should be turned to an upright position again, and the oral syringe disconnected by \ngently twisting it out of the bottle. \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n8. The dose should be administered in the mouth immediately (without dilution) in order to avoid \ncaking in the oral syringe. The oral syringe should be emptied slowly to allow swallowing; \nrapid squirting of the medicine may cause choking. \n\n9. The child-resistant screw cap should be replaced directly after use. The bottle adapter should \nnot be removed. \n\n10. The bottle may be stored at a temperature not above 25\u00b0C or in the refrigerator. \n \n\nCleaning \nClean the oral syringe immediately with water. Separate barrel and plunger and rinse both with \nwater. Shake off excess water and leave the disassembled oral syringe to dry until reassemble for \nnext dosing occasion. \n\n \nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What you need to know before you take Orfadin \n3. How to take Orfadin \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Orfadin \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Orfadin is and what it is used for \n \nThe active ingredient of Orfadin is nitisinone. This medicine is used for treatment of a rare disease \ncalled hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 in adults, adolescents and children (in any age range).  \n \nIn this disease your body is unable to completely break down the amino acid tyrosine (amino acids are \nbuilding blocks of our proteins), forming harmful substances. These substances are accumulated in \nyour body. Orfadin blocks the breakdown of tyrosine and the harmful substances are not formed.  \n \nYou must follow a special diet while you are taking this medicine, because tyrosine will remain in \nyour body. This special diet is based on low tyrosine and phenylalanine (another amino acid) content. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Orfadin \n \nDo not take Orfadin \n- if you are allergic to nitisinone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nDo not breast-feed while taking this medicine, see section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Orfadin. \n- Your eyes will be checked by an ophthalmologist before and regularly during nitisinone \n\ntreatment. If you get red eyes or any other signs of effects on the eyes, contact your doctor \nimmediately for an eye examination. Eye problems could be a sign of inadequate dietary control \n(see section 4). \n\n \nDuring the treatment, blood samples will be drawn in order for your doctor to check whether the \ntreatment is adequate and to make sure that there are no possible side effects causing blood disorders. \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n \nYour liver will be checked at regular intervals because the disease affects the liver. \n \nFollow-up by your doctor should be performed every 6 months. If you experience any side effects, \nshorter intervals are recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Orfadin \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nOrfadin may interfere with the effect of other medicines, such as: \n- Medicines for epilepsy (such as phenytoin) \n- Medicines against blood clotting (such as warfarin) \n \nOrfadin with food \nIf you start treatment by taking it with food, it is recommended that you carry on taking it with food \nthroughout your course of treatment. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThe safety of this medicine has not been studied in pregnant and breast-feeding women.  \nPlease contact your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant you should contact \nyour doctor immediately. \nDo not breast-feed while taking this medicine, see section \u201cDo not take Orfadin\u201d. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, if you \nexperience side effects affecting your vision you should not drive or use machines until your vision is \nback to normal (see section 4\u201cPossible side effects\u201d).  \n \n \n3. How to take Orfadin \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nTreatment with this medicine should be started and supervised by a doctor experienced in the \ntreatment of the disease (hereditary tyrosinemia type 1). \n \nThe recommended total daily dose is 1 mg/kg body weight administered orally. Your doctor will \nadjust the dose individually. \nIt is recommended to administer the dose once daily. However, due to the limited data in patients with \nbody weight <20 kg, it is recommended to divide the total daily dose into two daily administrations in \nthis patient population. \n \nIf you have problems with swallowing the capsules, you may open the capsule and mix the powder \nwith a small amount of water or formula diet just before you take it. \n \nIf you take more Orfadin than you should \nIf you have taken more of this medicine than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as \npossible.  \n \nIf you forget to take Orfadin \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you forget to take a dose, contact your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you stop taking Orfadin \nIf you have the impression that the medicine is not working properly, talk to your doctor. Do not \nchange the dose or stop the treatment without talking to your doctor. \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you notice any side effects relating to the eyes, talk to your doctor immediately to have an eye \nexamination. Treatment with nitisinone leads to higher levels of tyrosine in the blood which can cause \neye related symptoms. Common eye related side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) caused \nby higher tyrosine levels are inflammation in the eye (conjunctivitis), opacity and inflammation in the \ncornea (keratitis), sensitivity to light (photophobia) and eye pain. Inflammation of the eyelid \n(blepharitis) is an uncommon side effect (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n \nOther common side effects \n- Reduced number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) and white blood cells (leukopenia), shortage of \n\ncertain white blood cells (granulocytopenia). \n \nOther uncommon side effects  \n- increased number of white blood cells (leucocytosis),  \n- itching (pruritus), skin inflammation (exfoliative dermatitis), rash. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Orfadin \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle and the carton after \u201cEXP\u201d.  \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \nThe medicine can be stored for a single period of 2 months (for 2 mg capsules) or 3 months (for 5 mg, \n10 mg and 20 mg capsules) at a temperature not above 25\u00b0C, after which it must be discarded. \n \nDo not forget to mark the date on the bottle, when removed from the refrigerator. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

However, if you \nexperience side effects affecting your vision you should not drive or use machines until your vision is \nback to normal (see section 4\u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n \nOrfadin contains sodium, glycerol and sodium benzoate \nThis medicinal product contains 0.7 mg (0.03 mmol) sodium per ml. \nA dose of 20 ml oral suspension (10 g glycerol) or more may cause headache, stomach upset and \ndiarrhoea. \nSodium benzoate may increase jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in pre-term and full-term \njaundiced neonates and develop into kernicterus (brain damage due to deposits of bilirubin in the \nbrain). The newborn baby\u2019s blood levels of bilirubin (a substance that causes the yellowing of the skin \nin high levels) will be closely monitored. If the levels are markedly higher than they should be, \nespecially in prematures babies with risk factors as acidosis (too low pH in the blood) and low albumin \nlevel (a protein in the blood) treatment with Orfadin capsules will be considered instead of the oral \nsuspension until the bilirubin plasma levels are normalised. \n \n \n3. How to take Orfadin \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nFollow the instructions given below for dose preparation and administration carefully, in order \nto ensure that the correct dose is administered. \n \nTreatment with this medicine should be started and supervised by a doctor experienced in the \ntreatment of the disease (hereditary tyrosinemia type 1). \n \nThe recommended total daily dose is 1 mg/kg body weight administered orally. Your doctor will \nadjust the dose individually. \nIt is recommended to administer the dose once daily. However, due to the limited data in patients with \nbody weight <20 kg, it is recommended to divide the total daily dose into two daily administrations in \nthis patient population. \n \nThe oral suspension is taken with a oral syringe directly in the mouth without dilution. \nOrfadin must not be injected. Do not attach a needle to the syringe. \n \n\n\n\n 38 \n\nHow to prepare the dose to be administered \nThe dose that your doctor prescribes you should be given in ml of suspension and not in mg. This is \nbecause the oral syringe which is used to withdraw the correct dose from the bottle is marked in ml. If \nyour prescription is in mg, contact your pharmacist or doctor for advice. \n \nThe pack contains a bottle of medicine with a cap, a bottle adaptor and three oral syringes (1 ml, 3 ml \nand 5 ml). Always use one of the oral syringes provided to take the medicine. \n\n\u2022 The 1-ml oral syringe (the smallest oral syringe) is marked from 0.1 ml to 1 ml with minor \n0.01-ml graduations. It is used for measuring doses of less than or up to 1 ml. \n\n\u2022 The 3 ml oral syringe (the middle sized oral syringe), is marked from 1 ml to 3 ml with minor \n0.1-ml graduations. It is used for measuring doses of more than 1 ml and up to 3 ml. \n\n\u2022 The 5 ml oral syringe (the largest oral syringe), is marked from 1 ml to 5 ml with minor \n0.2-ml graduations. It is used for measuring doses of more than 3 ml.  \n\n \nIt is important that you use the correct oral syringe when taking the medicine. Your doctor, pharmacist \nor nurse will advise which oral syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed. \n \nHow to prepare a new bottle of medicine for first time use: \n \nBefore you take the first dose, shake the bottle vigorously since during long-term storage the particles \nwill form a solid cake at the bottom of the bottle. Follow the instructions below: \n \n\n        \n  Figure A.              Figure B.       Figure C. \n \n\n1. Remove the bottle from the refrigerator. Note the date when the bottle is removed from the \nrefrigerator on the bottle label. \n\n2. Shake the bottle vigorously for at least 20 seconds until the solid cake at the bottom of the \nbottle is completely dispersed (figure A). \n\n3. Remove the child resistant screw cap by pushing it down firmly and turning it anti-clockwise \n(figure B).  \n\n4. Place the open bottle upright on a table. Push the plastic adapter firmly into the neck of the \nbottle as far as you can (figure C) and close the bottle with the child resistant screw cap.  \n\n \nFor subsequent dosing see the instructions below \u2018How to prepare a dose of medicine\u2019. \n \nHow to prepare a dose of medicine \n \n\n            \n Figure D.       Figur E.           Figure F. \n\n\n\n 39 \n\n \n1. Shake the bottle vigorously for at least 5 seconds (figure D).  \n2. Immediately thereafter, open the bottle by removing the child resistant screw cap. \n3. Push the plunger inside the oral syringe fully down. \n4. Keep the bottle in an upright position and insert the oral syringe firmly into the hole at the top \n\nof the bottle (figure E). \n5. Carefully turn the bottle upside down with the oral syringe in place (Figure F). \n6. In order to withdraw the prescribed dose (ml), pull the plunger slowly down until the top edge \n\nof the black ring is exactly level with the line marking the dose (Figure F). If any air bubbles \nare observed inside the filled oral syringe, push the plunger back up until the air bubbles are \nexpelled. Then pull the plunger down again until the top edge of the black ring is exactly level \nwith the line marking the dose. \n\n7. Turn the bottle to an upright position again. Disconnect the oral syringe by gently twisting it \nout of the bottle. \n\n8. The dose should be administered in the mouth immediately (without dilution) in order to avoid \ncaking in the oral syringe. The oral syringe must be emptied slowly to allow swallowing; rapid \nsquirting of the medicine may cause choking. \n\n9. Replace the child resistant screw cap directly after use. The bottle adapter should not be \nremoved. \n\n10. The bottle may be stored at room temperature (not above 25\u00b0C). \n \n\nCleaning:  \nClean the oral syringe immediately with water. Separate barrel and plunger and rinse both with \nwater. Shake off excess water and leave the disassembled oral syringe to dry until reassemble for \nnext dosing occasion. \n\n \nIf you take more Orfadin than you should \nIf you have taken more of this medicine than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as \npossible.  \n \nIf you forget to take Orfadin \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you forget to take a dose, contact your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you stop taking Orfadin \nIf you have the impression that the medicine is not working properly, talk to your doctor. Do not \nchange the dose or stop the treatment without talking to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.
