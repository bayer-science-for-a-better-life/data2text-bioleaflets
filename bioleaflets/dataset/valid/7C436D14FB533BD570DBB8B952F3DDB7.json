PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection.  \n \nClear, colourless solution for injection.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients \ntreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia \nand myelodysplastic syndromes). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPelgraz therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or \nhaematology. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n \nPosology \n \nOne 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe or pre-filled injector) of Pelgraz is recommended for each \nchemotherapy cycle, given at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Pelgraz in children and adolescents has not yet been established. Currently \navailable data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nNo dose change is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end-stage \nrenal disease. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPelgraz is for subcutaneous use.The injections should be given subcutaneously into the thigh, \nabdomen or upper arm. \n \nFor instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) \n \nLimited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery of severe neutropenia for \npegfilgrastim to filgrastim in patients with de novo AML (see section 5.1). However, the long-term \neffects of pegfilgrastim have not been established in AML; therefore, it should be used with caution in \nthis patient population. \n \nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects \nmay be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic \nsyndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary AML; therefore, it should \nnot be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast \ntransformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from AML. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged < 55 years with \ncytogenetics t(15;17) have not been established. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose \nchemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy beyond established dose regimens. \n \nPulmonary adverse reactions \n \nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF \nadministration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher \nrisk (see section 4.8). \n \nThe onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological \nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil \ncount may be preliminary signs of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In such \ncircumstances pegfilgrastim should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the \nappropriate treatment given (see section 4.8). \n \nGlomerulonephritis \n \nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \n \nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration \nand is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients \nwho develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard \nsymptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n \nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture \n \nGenerally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal \ncases, have been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see section 4.8). Therefore, \nspleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of \nsplenic rupture should be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip \npain. \n \nThrombocytopenia and anaemia \n \nTreatment with pegfilgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full \ndose myelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of \nplatelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering \nsingle or combination chemotherapeutic medicinal products which are known to cause severe \nthrombocytopenia. \n \nSickle cell anaemia \n \nSickle cell crises have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or \nsickle cell disease (see section 4.8). Therefore, physicians should use caution when prescribing \npegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, should monitor appropriate clinical \nparameters and laboratory status and be attentive to the possible association of this medicinal product \nwith splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis. \n \nLeukocytosis \n \nWhite blood cell (WBC) counts of 100 x 109/L or greater have been observed in less than 1% of \npatients receiving pegfilgrastim. No adverse reactions directly attributable to this degree of \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nleukocytosis have been reported. Such elevation in WBCs is transient, typically seen 24 to 48 hours \nafter administration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicinal product. \nConsistent with the clinical effects and the potential for leukocytosis, a WBC count should be \nperformed at regular intervals during therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/L after the expected \nnadir, this medicinal product should be discontinued immediately. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have \nbeen reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. Permanently discontinue pegfilgrastim in patients \nwith clinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer pegfilgrastim to patients with a history \nof hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate \ntherapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days. \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported rarely in \nassociation with pegfilgrastim treatment. If the patient has developed SJS with the use of \npegfilgrastim, treatment with pegfilgrastim must not be restarted in this patient at any time.  \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \nantibodies against pegfilgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present. \n \nAortitis \n \nAortitis has been reported after filgrastim or pegfilgrastim administration in healthy subjects and in \ncancer patients. The symptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and \nincreased inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein and WBC count). In most cases aortitis was \ndiagnosed by CT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. See also \nsection 4.8. \n \nMobilisation of PBPC \nThe safety and efficacy of Pelgraz for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or healthy \ndonors has not been adequately evaluated. \n \nOther special precautions \n \nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient positive bone-imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting \nbone-imaging results. \n \nExcipients with known effect \nThis medicinal product contains 50 mg sorbitol in each unit volume, which is equivalent to 30 mg per \n6 mg dose.  \n \nPelgraz  contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \nAll patients \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a \npegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. \nIn clinical trials, pegfilgrastim has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. \nConcomitant use of Pelgraz with any chemotherapeutic medicinal product has not been evaluated in \npatients. In animal models concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or \nother antimetabolites has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression. \n \nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been \nspecifically investigated in clinical trials. \n \nThe potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been \nspecifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Pelgraz have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy \nassociated with delayed myelosuppression e.g. nitrosoureas. \n \nSpecific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical trials have not \nindicated an interaction of pegfilgrastim with any other medicinal products. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pegfilgrastim is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of pegfilgrastim/metabolites in human milk, a risk to \nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from pegfilgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nPegfilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative \nweekly doses approximately 6 to 9 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body \nsurface area) (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPegfilgrastim has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common [\u2265 1/10]) and \nmusculoskeletal pain (common [\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10]). Bone pain was generally of mild to moderate \nseverity, transient and could be controlled in most patients with standard analgesics. \n \nHypersensitivity-type reactions, including skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, erythaema, \nflushing, and hypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim (uncommon \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n[\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100]). Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients \nreceiving pegfilgrastim (uncommon) (see section 4.4). \n \nCapillary Leak Syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported as \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following \nadministration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors; see section 4.4 and section \u201cDescription of \nselected adverse reactions\u201d below. \n \nSplenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon. \n \nSplenic rupture including some fatal cases is uncommonly reported following administration of \npegfilgrastim (see section 4.4). \n \nUncommon pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, \npulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Uncommonly, cases have resulted in \nrespiratory failure or ARDS, which may be fatal (see section 4.4). \n \nIsolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell \ndisease (uncommon in sickle cell patients) (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe data in the table below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical trials and spontaneous \nreporting.

The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based upon 1,576 patients receiving pegfilgrastim in nine randomised clinical trials. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nUncommon cases of Sweet\u2019s syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying \nhaematological malignancies may play a role. \n \nUncommon events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. \nThe mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving pegfilgrastim is unknown. \n \nInjection site reactions, including injection site erythaema (uncommon) as well as injection site pain \n(common events) have occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim. \n \nCommon cases of leukocytosis (WBC > 100 x 109/L) have been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nReversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid and alkaline phosphatase, with no associated \nclinical effects, were uncommon; reversible, mild to moderate elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, \nwith no associated clinical effects, were uncommon in patients receiving pegfilgrastim following \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \nNausea and headaches were very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. \n \nUncommon elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate \naminotransferase (AST), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline. \n \nCommon cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported. \n \nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in the post-marketing setting with granulocyte-\ncolony stimulating factor use. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant \ndiseases, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medicinal products or undergoing apheresis (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe experience in children is limited. A higher frequency of serious adverse reactions in younger \nchildren aged 0-5 years (92%) has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11 and 12-21 \nyears respectively (80% and 67%) and adults. The most common adverse reaction reported was bone \npain (see section 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of 300 mcg/kg have been administered subcutaneously to a limited number of healthy \nvolunteers and patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse reactions. The adverse \nreactions were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of pegfilgrastim. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factor; ATC Code: L03AA13 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n \nPelgraz is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nHuman granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein, which regulates the \nproduction and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of \nrecombinant human G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) with a single 20 kd PEG molecule. Pegfilgrastim is a \nsustained duration form of filgrastim due to decreased renal clearance. Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim \nhave been shown to have identical modes of action, causing a marked increase in peripheral blood \nneutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes and/or lymphocytes. Similarly \nto filgrastim, neutrophils produced in response to pegfilgrastim show normal or enhanced function as \ndemonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. As with other haematopoietic growth \nfactors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human endothelial cells. G-CSF can \npromote growth of myeloid cells, including malignant cells, in vitro and similar effects may be seen on \nsome non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n \nIn two randomised, double-blind, pivotal studies in patients with high-risk stage II-IV breast cancer \nundergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, use of \npegfilgrastim, as a single once per cycle dose, reduced the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of \nfebrile neutropenia similarly to that observed with daily administrations of filgrastim (a median of 11 \ndaily administrations). In the absence of growth factor support, this regimen has been reported to result \nin a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 5 to7 days, and a 30-40% incidence of febrile \nneutropenia. In one study (n = 157), which used a 6 mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim the mean duration \nof grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.8 days compared with 1.6 days in the \nfilgrastim group (difference 0.23 days, 95% CI -0.15, 0.63). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile \nneutropenia was 13% of pegfilgrastim-treated patients compared with 20% of filgrastim-treated \npatients (difference 7%, 95% CI of -19%, 5%). In a second study (n = 310), which used a weight-\nadjusted dose (100 mcg/kg), the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was \n1.7 days, compared with 1.8 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.03 days, 95% CI -0.36, 0.30). \nThe overall rate of febrile neutropenia was 9% of patients treated with pegfilgrastim and 18% of \npatients treated with filgrastim (difference 9%, 95% CI of -16.8%,-1.1%). \n \nIn a placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with breast cancer the effect of pegfilgrastim on \nthe incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy \nregimen associated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 10-20% (docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for \n4 cycles). Nine hundred and twenty eight patients were randomised to receive either a single dose of \npegfilgrastim or placebo approximately 24 hours (day 2) after chemotherapy in each cycle. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia was lower for patients randomised to receive pegfilgrastim compared \nwith placebo (1% versus 17%, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalisations and intravenous  anti-\ninfective use associated with a clinical diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was lower in the pegfilgrastim \ngroup compared with placebo (1% versus 14%, p < 0.001; and 2% versus 10%, p < 0.001). \n \nA small (n = 83), Phase II, randomised, double-blind study in patients receiving chemotherapy for de \nnovo AML compared pegfilgrastim (single dose of 6 mg) with filgrastim, administered during \ninduction chemotherapy. Median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was estimated as 22 days \nin both treatment groups. Long term outcome was not studied (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn a phase II (n = 37) multicentre, randomised, open-label study of paediatric sarcoma patients \nreceiving 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils \n< 0.5 x 109) was observed in younger children aged 0-5 years (8.9 days) compared to older children \naged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. Additionally a higher \nincidence of febrile neutropenia was observed in younger children aged 0-5 years (75%) compared to \nolder children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (70% and 33%, respectively) and adults (see sections \n4.8 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter a single subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim, the peak serum concentration of pegfilgrastim \noccurs at 16 to 120 hours after dosing and serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim are maintained during \nthe period of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The elimination of pegfilgrastim is \nnon-linear with respect to dose; serum clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with increasing dose. \nPegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, which becomes \nsaturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the serum \nconcentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see figure 1). \n \n\nFigure 1. Profile of median pegfilgrastim serum concentration and Absolute Neutrophil Count \n(ANC) in chemotherapy treated patients after a single 6 mg injection \n\n \n\n \n \nDue to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim is not \nexpected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment. In an open-label, single dose study (n = 31) \nvarious stages of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, had no impact on the \npharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim. \n \nElderly \n \nLimited data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects (> 65 years) is \nsimilar to that in adults.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were studied in 37 paediatric patients with sarcoma, who \nreceived 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy. The youngest \nage group (0-5 years) had a higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) (\u00b1 Standard Deviation) \n(47.9 \u00b1 22.5 mcg\u00b7hr/ml) than older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (22.0 \u00b1 13.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL \nand 29.3 \u00b1 23.2 mcg\u00b7hr/mL, respectively) (see section 5.1). With the exception of the youngest age \ngroup (0-5 years), the mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar to that for adult patients with \nhigh-risk stage II-IV breast cancer and receiving 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of \ndoxorubicin/docetaxel (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected \npharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, \nextramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement. \n \nThere were no adverse effects observed in offspring from pregnant rats given pegfilgrastim \nsubcutaneously, but in rabbits pegfilgrastim has been shown to cause embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo \nloss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen \nwhen pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. In rat studies, it was shown that \npegfilgrastim may cross the placenta. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, \noestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by \npegfilgrastim given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nPelgraz 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \npegfilgrastim \n\n \n This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their symptoms of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Pelgraz is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Pelgraz \n3. How to use Pelgraz \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Pelgraz \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Pelgraz is and what it is used for \n \nPelgraz contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by \nbiotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very \nsimilar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body. \n \nPelgraz is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence \nof febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of \ncytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are \nimportant as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of \nchemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells \nfall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an \nincreased risk of infection. \n \nYour doctor has given you Pelgraz to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes \nblood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Pelgraz \n \nDo not use Pelgraz \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim,  or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pelgraz if you: \n \n\u2022 experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, \n\nswelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the skin that itch. \n\u2022 have an allergy to latex. The needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of latex \n\nand may cause severe allergic reactions. \n\u2022 experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute Respiratory \n\nDistress Syndrome (ARDS). \n\u2022 have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: \n\n- swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty \nbreathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. \n\nThese could be symptoms of condition called \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d which causes blood \nto leak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4. \n\n\u2022 get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a \nproblem with your spleen (splenomegaly). \n\n\u2022 have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema), \ninflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung \ninfiltration). \n\n\u2022 are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) or \ndecreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot \n(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. \n\n\u2022 have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. \n\u2022 have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, \n\ntongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing these could \nbe signs of a severe allergic reaction. \n\n \nYour doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as Pelgraz can harm the tiny filters inside your \nkidneys (glomerulonephritis). \n \nSevere skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of Pelgraz . Stop \nusing Pelgraz and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described in \nsection 4. \n \nYou should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you develop or \nare likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Pelgraz, unless instructed by your \ndoctor. \n \nInflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) \nhas been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include fever, \nabdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein and \nwhite blood cell count). Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. \n \nLoss of response to pegfilgrastim \n \nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, \nyour doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which \nneutralise pegfilgrastim\u2019s activity. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Pelgraz in children has not yet been established. Ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\nOther medicines and Pelgraz \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Pelgraz has not been tested in \npregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: \n\u2022 are pregnant; \n\u2022 think you may be pregnant; or \n\u2022 are planning to have a baby. \n \nIf you become pregnant during Pelgraz treatment, please inform your doctor.  \n \nUnless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Pelgraz. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nPelgraz has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines. \n \nPelgraz contains sorbitol (E420) and sodium acetate \n \nThis medicinal product contains 50 mg sorbitol in each unit volume, which is equivalent to 30 mg per \n6 mg dose. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019 \n \n \n3. How to use Pelgraz \n \nPelgraz is for use in adults aged 18 and over. \n \nAlways take Pelgraz exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are unsure. The usual dose is one 6 mg subcutaneous injection (injection under your \nskin) using a pre-filled syringe and it should be given at least 24 hours after your last dose of \nchemotherapy at the end of each chemotherapy cycle. \n \nDo not shake Pelgraz vigorously as this may affect its activity. \n \nInjecting Pelgraz yourself \n \nYour doctor may decide that it would be more convenient for you to inject Pelgraz yourself. Your \ndoctor or nurse will show you how to inject yourself. Do not try to inject yourself unless you have \nreceived special training from your doctor or nurse. \n \nThe instructions how to inject yourself  \nare given below, but proper treatment of your disease requires close and constant co-operation with \nyour doctor. \n \nIf you are not sure about giving yourself the injection or you have any questions, please ask your \ndoctor or nurse for help. \n \nHow do I inject Pelgraz myself? \n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\nYou will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \nEquipment that you need \n \nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:  \n\u2022 a pre-filled syringe of Pelgraz;  \n\u2022 alcohol swab.  \n \nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Pelgraz? \n \n1. Take the pre-filled syringe out of the refrigerator.  \n2. Do not remove the needle cover from the syringe until just before you are ready to inject. \n3. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed \n\nthe last day of the month shown or if it has been kept outside of the refrigerator for more than 72 \nhours or has otherwise expired.  \n\n4. Check the appearance of Pelgraz. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles in \nit, you must not use it.  \n\n5. For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room \ntemperature or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. Do not warm \nPelgraz in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water).  \n\n6. Wash your hands thoroughly.  \n7. Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach them (the \n\npre-filled syringe and alcohol swab).  \n \nHow do I prepare my Pelgraz injection? \n \nBefore you inject Pelgraz you must do the following:  \n \n1.  Hold the syringe and gently take the cover from the needle without twisting. Pull straight as \n\nshown in pictures 1 and 2. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger.  \n \n\n1 \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n \n\n2 \n\n \n  \n\n2.  You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. You do not have to remove the air \nbubble before injecting. Injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless.  \n\n3.  You can now use the pre-filled syringe.  \n \nWhere should I give my injection? \n \nThe most suitable places to inject yourself are:  \n\u2022 the top of your thighs; and  \n\u2022 the abdomen, except for the area around the navel (see picture 3).  \n \n\n3 \n\n \n \nIf someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back of your arms (see picture 4) \n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n \n\n4 \n\n \n \nIt is better to change the injection site every time to avoid the risk of soreness at any one site.  \n \nHow do I give my injection?  \n \na.  Disinfect the injection site by using an alcohol swab and pinch the skin between your thumb and \n\nforefinger, without squeezing it (see picture 5).  \n \n\n5 \n\n \n \nPre-filled syringe with needle safety guard  \n \nb.  Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor (see picture 6).  \nc.  Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. If you see blood \n\nin the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place.  \nd.  Always keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly while grasping the \n\nfinger flange until the entire dose has been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any \nfurther. Do not release the pressure on the plunger!  \n\ne.  After injecting the liquid, while keeping the syringe at the same angle and maintaining pressure \non the plunger, remove the needle and then let go of your skin. The protective sleeve will \nautomatically cover the needle and an audible \u201cclick\u201d will be heard to confirm shield activation \n(see picture 7). The needle guard will not activate unless the entire dose has been given.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n7 \n\n \n \nRemember \nIf you have any problems, please ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice.  \n \nDisposing of used syringes  \n \nDispose of the syringe as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you use more Pelgraz than you should \n \nIf you use more Pelgraz than you should contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you forget to inject Pelgraz \n \nIf you are injecting yourself and have forgotten your dose of Pelgraz, you should contact your doctor \nto discuss when you should inject the next dose. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n \n\nIf you stop using Pelgraz \n \nYour doctor will tell you when to stop using Pelgraz. It is quite normal to have a number of courses of \ntreatment with Pelgraz. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Pelgraz can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPlease tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following or combination of the following \nside effects: \n\u2022 swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty \n\nbreathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These \nsymptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. \n\n \nThese could be symptoms of an uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) condition called \n\u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body \nand needs urgent medical attention. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 bone pain. Your doctor will tell you what you can take to ease the bone pain. \n\u2022 nausea and headaches. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 pain at the site of injection. \n\u2022 general aches and pains in the joints and muscles. \n\u2022 pain in the chest that is not caused by heart disease or a heart attack. \n\u2022 some changes may occur in your blood, but these will be detected by routine blood tests. Your \n\nwhite blood cell count may become high for a short period of time. Your platelet count may \nbecome low which might result in bruising. \n\n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 allergic-type reactions, including redness and flushing, skin rash, and raised areas of the skin \n\nthat itch. \n\u2022 serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty \n\nbreathing, swelling of the face). \n\u2022 increased spleen size. \n\u2022 spleen rupture.

What you need to know before you use Pelgraz \n3. How to use Pelgraz \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Pelgraz \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Pelgraz is and what it is used for \n \nPelgraz contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by \nbiotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very \nsimilar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body. \n \nPelgraz is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence \nof febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of \ncytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are \nimportant as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of \nchemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells \nfall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an \nincreased risk of infection. \n \nYour doctor has given you Pelgraz to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes \nblood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Pelgraz \n \nDo not use Pelgraz \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim,  or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Pelgraz if you: \n \n\u2022 experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, \n\nswelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the skin that itch. \n\u2022 have an allergy to latex. The needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of latex \n\nand may cause severe allergic reactions. \n\u2022 experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute Respiratory \n\nDistress Syndrome (ARDS). \n\u2022 have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: \n\n- swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty \nbreathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. \n\nThese could be symptoms of condition called \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d which causes blood \nto leak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4. \n\n\u2022 get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a \nproblem with your spleen (splenomegaly). \n\n\u2022 have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema), \ninflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung \ninfiltration). \n\n\u2022 are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) or \ndecreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot \n(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. \n\n\u2022 have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. \n\u2022 have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, \n\ntongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing these could \nbe signs of a severe allergic reaction. \n\n \nYour doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as Pelgraz can harm the tiny filters inside your \nkidneys (glomerulonephritis). \n \nSevere skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of Pelgraz . Stop \nusing Pelgraz and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described in \nsection 4. \n \nYou should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you develop or \nare likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Pelgraz, unless instructed by your \ndoctor. \n \nInflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) \nhas been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include fever, \nabdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein and \nwhite blood cell count). Tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. \n \nLoss of response to pegfilgrastim \n \nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, \nyour doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which \nneutralise pegfilgrastim\u2019s activity. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Pelgraz in children has not yet been established. Ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n \n\nOther medicines and Pelgraz \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Pelgraz has not been tested in \npregnant women. It is important to tell your doctor if you: \n\u2022 are pregnant; \n\u2022 think you may be pregnant; or \n\u2022 are planning to have a baby. \n \nIf you become pregnant during Pelgraz treatment, please inform your doctor.  \n \nUnless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Pelgraz. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nPelgraz has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines. \n \nPelgraz contains sorbitol (E420) and sodium acetate \n \nThis medicinal product contains 50 mg sorbitol in each unit volume, which is equivalent to 30 mg per \n6 mg dose. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019 \n \n \n3. How to use Pelgraz \n \nPelgraz is for use in adults aged 18 and over. \n \nAlways take Pelgraz exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are unsure. The usual dose is one 6 mg subcutaneous injection (injection under your \nskin) using a pre-filled injector and it should be given at least 24 hours after your last dose of \nchemotherapy at the end of each chemotherapy cycle. \n \nDo not shake Pelgraz vigorously as this may affect its activity. \n \nInjecting Pelgraz yourself \n \nYour doctor may decide that it would be more convenient for you to inject Pelgraz yourself. Your \ndoctor or nurse will show you how to inject yourself. Do not try to inject yourself unless you have \nreceived special training from your doctor or nurse. \n \nThe instructions how to inject yourself  \nare given below, but proper treatment of your disease requires close and constant co-operation with \nyour doctor. \n \nIf you are not sure about giving yourself the injection or you have any questions, please ask your \ndoctor or nurse for help. \n \nHow do I inject Pelgraz myself? \n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nYou will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \nEquipment that you need \n \nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:  \n\u2022 a pre-filled injector of Pelgraz;  \n\u2022 alcohol swab.  \n \nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Pelgraz? \n \n1. Take the pre-filled injector out of the refrigerator.  \n2. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled injector label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed \n\nthe last day of the month shown or if it has been kept outside of the refrigerator for more than 72 \nhours or has otherwise expired.  \n\n3. Check the appearance of Pelgraz. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles in \nit, you must not use it.  \n\n4. For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled injector stand for 30 minutes to reach room \ntemperature or hold the pre-filled injector gently in your hand for a few minutes. Do not warm \nPelgraz in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water).  \n\n5. Wash your hands thoroughly.  \n6. Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach them (the \n\npre-filled injector and alcohol swab).  \n \nHow do I prepare my Pelgraz injection? \n \nBefore you inject Pelgraz you must do the following:  \n \n\n\u2022 Choose a clean, well-lit space to administer your medication. \n\u2022 Check expiration date on package. Do not use if expiration date has passed. \n\u2022 Gather an alcohol swab and a sharps container  \n\n \nPreparation \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Wash hands with soap under warm running water. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Choose injection site (Abdomen or thigh if a patient is injecting \nhimself/herself, with the additional option of the back of the arm if \na Healthcare Provider or caregiver is assisting them) \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Clean injection site: use an alcohol swab to wipe site clean. Allow \nto air dry. \n\n \n1. Pre-Injection \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Inspect liquid in window. Check for any changes in colour, \ncloudiness or large particles. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Remove bottom cap: Twist and pull bottom cap to remove. Keep \nhands away from needle guard after cap is removed. Do not recap. \nDispose of bottom cap immediately. Do not inject if you drop the \npre-filled injector after removing cap. \n\n\u2022 Inject within 5 minutes of removing bottom cap. \n\n \n2. Injection \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Place the injector straight onto your skin (about 90 degrees).  \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Push the handle straight down: The medicine will be injected as \nyou push. Do this at a speed that is comfortable for you. \n\n\u2022 Do not lift the injector during injection. \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Injection is completed when the handle has been pushed down as \nfar as possible, you hear a click and the orange body is no longer \nvisible. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Lift straight up: The yellow band indicates that the needle guard \nis locked. \n\n \n3. Disposal \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Dispose of the used Pelgraz pre-filled injector: Place injector in \nan approved sharps container. Regulations vary by region. Check \nwith your doctor or pharmacist for proper disposal instructions. \nDo not dispose of injector in household trash. \n\n \nRemember \nIf you have any problems, please ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice.  \n \nIf you use more Pelgraz than you should \n \nIf you use more Pelgraz than you should contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you forget to inject Pelgraz \n \nIf you are injecting yourself and have forgotten your dose of Pelgraz, you should contact your doctor \nto discuss when you should inject the next dose. \n \nIf you stop using Pelgraz \n \nYour doctor will tell you when to stop using Pelgraz. It is quite normal to have a number of courses of \ntreatment with Pelgraz. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Pelgraz can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n \n\nPlease tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following or combination of the following \nside effects: \n\u2022 swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty \n\nbreathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. These \nsymptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. \n\n \nThese could be symptoms of an uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) condition called \n\u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body \nand needs urgent medical attention. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 bone pain.

what you need to know before you use pelgraz", "Section_Content": "do not use pelgraz if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using pelgraz if you: experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the skin that itch. have an allergy to latex. the needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of latex and may cause severe allergic reactions. experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. this can be a sign of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: - swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. these could be symptoms of condition called \"capillary leak syndrome\" which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body. see section 4. get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. this may be a sign of a problem with your spleen (splenomegaly). have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung infiltration). are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) or decreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia). your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. have sickle cell anaemia. your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing these could be signs of a severe allergic reaction. your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as pelgraz can harm the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis). severe skin reactions (stevens-johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of pelgraz . stop using pelgraz and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described in section 4. you should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. if you develop or are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use pelgraz, unless instructed by your doctor. inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. the symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers (e.g. c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. loss of response to pegfilgrastim if you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which neutralise pegfilgrastim's activity. children and adolescents the safety and efficacy of pelgraz in children has not yet been established. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. other medicines and pelgraz tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. pelgraz has not been tested in pregnant women. it is important to tell your doctor if you: are pregnant; think you may be pregnant; or are planning to have a baby. if you become pregnant during pelgraz treatment, please inform your doctor. unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use pelgraz. driving and using machines pelgraz has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines. pelgraz contains sorbitol (e420) and sodium acetate this medicinal product contains 50 mg sorbitol in each unit volume, which is equivalent to 30 mg per 6 mg dose. this medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, that is to say

adults aged 18 and over. always take pelgraz exactly as your doctor has told you. you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure. the usual dose is one 6 mg subcutaneous injection (injection under your skin) using a pre-filled syringe and it should be given at least 24 hours after your last dose of chemotherapy at the end of each chemotherapy cycle. do not shake pelgraz vigorously as this may affect its activity. injecting pelgraz yourself your doctor may decide that it would be more convenient for you to inject pelgraz yourself. your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject yourself. do not try to inject yourself unless you have received special training from your doctor or nurse. the instructions how to inject yourself are given below, but proper treatment of your disease requires close and constant co-operation with your doctor. if you are not sure about giving yourself the injection or you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. how do i inject pelgraz myself? 29 you will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin. this is known as a subcutaneous injection. equipment that you need to give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need: a pre-filled syringe of pelgraz; alcohol swab. what should i do before i give myself a subcutaneous injection of pelgraz? 1. take the pre-filled syringe out of the refrigerator. 2. do not remove the needle cover from the syringe until just before you are ready to inject. 3. check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (exp). do not use it if the date has passed the last day of the month shown or if it has been kept outside of the refrigerator for more than 72 hours or has otherwise expired. 4. check the appearance of pelgraz. it must be a clear and colourless liquid. if there are particles in it, you must not use it. 5. for a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room temperature or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. do not warm pelgraz in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). 6. wash your hands thoroughly. 7. find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach them (the pre-filled syringe and alcohol swab). how do i prepare my pelgraz injection? before you inject pelgraz you must do the following: 1. hold the syringe and gently take the cover from the needle without twisting. pull straight as shown in pictures 1 and 2. do not touch the needle or push the plunger. 1 30 2 2. you may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. you do not have to remove the air bubble before injecting. injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless. 3. you can now use the pre-filled syringe. where should i give my injection? the most suitable places to inject yourself are: the top of your thighs; and the abdomen, except for the area around the navel (see picture 3). 3 if someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back of your arms (see picture 4) 31 4 it is better to change the injection site every time to avoid the risk of soreness at any one site. how do i give my injection? a. disinfect the injection site by using an alcohol swab and pinch the skin between your thumb and forefinger, without squeezing it (see picture 5). 5 pre-filled syringe with needle safety guard b. put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor (see picture 6). c. pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured. if you see blood in the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place. d. always keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly while grasping the finger flange until the entire dose has been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further. do not release the pressure on the plunger! e. after injecting the liquid, while keeping the syringe at the same angle and maintaining pressure on the plunger, remove the needle and then let go of your skin. the protective sleeve will automatically cover the needle and an audible \"click\" will be heard to confirm shield activation (see picture 7). the needle guard will not activate unless the entire dose has been given. 6 7 remember if you have any problems, please ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice. disposing of used syringes dispose of the syringe as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. if you use more pelgraz than you should if you use more pelgraz than you should contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. if you forget to inject pelgraz if you are injecting yourself and have forgotten your dose of pelgraz, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. if you stop using pelgraz your doctor will tell you when to stop using pelgraz. it is quite normal to have a number of courses of treatment with pelgraz. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "pelgraz", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "18", "Type": "NUMBER",

doctor immediately if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. these symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. these could be symptoms of an uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) condition called \"capillary leak syndrome\" which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): bone pain. your doctor will tell you what you can take to ease the bone pain. nausea and headaches. common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): pain at the site of injection. general aches and pains in the joints and muscles. pain in the chest that is not caused by heart disease or a heart attack. some changes may occur in your blood, but these will be detected by routine blood tests. your white blood cell count may become high for a short period of time. your platelet count may become low which might result in bruising. uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): allergic-type reactions, including redness and flushing, skin rash, and raised areas of the skin that itch. serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face). increased spleen size. spleen rupture. some cases of splenic rupture were fatal. it is important that you contact your doctor immediately if you experience pain in the upper left side of the abdomen or left shoulder pain since this may relate to a problem with your spleen. breathing problems. if you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing please tell your doctor. sweet's syndrome (plum-coloured, raised, painful lesions on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with fever) has occurred but other factors may play a role. cutaneous vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin). damage to the tiny filters inside your kidneys (glomerulonephritis). redness at the site of injection. abnormal blood test results (lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid and alkaline phosphatase). abnormal blood test results related to the liver (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase). coughing up blood (haemoptysis) rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 34 inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body), see section 2. bleeding from the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage) stevens-johnson syndrome, which can appear as reddish target-like or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes and can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms. stop using pelgraz if you develop these symptoms and contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. see also section 2. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition":
