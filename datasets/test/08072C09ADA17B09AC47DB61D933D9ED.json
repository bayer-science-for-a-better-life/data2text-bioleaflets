CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nFetcroja is indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adults \n\nwith limited treatment options (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that Fetcroja should be used to treat patients that have limited treatment options \n\nonly after consultation with a physician with appropriate experience in the management of infectious \n\ndiseases. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nTable 1 Recommended dose of Fetcroja\n1\n for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCL) \n\n\u2265 90 mL/min2 \n\nRenal function Dose \nFrequency Duration of \n\ntreatment \n\nNormal renal function 2 g Every 8 hours Duration in \n\naccordance with the \n\nsite of infection\n3\n \n\n(CrCL \u226590 to < 120 mL/min) \n\nAugmented renal clearance 2 g Every 6 hours Duration in \n\naccordance with the \n\nsite of infection\n3\n \n\n(CrCL \u2265 120 mL/min) \n\n1\nTo be used in combination with antibacterial agents active against anaerobic pathogens and/or Gram-positive \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\npathogens when these are known or suspected to be contributing to the infectious process. \n\n2\nAs calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. \n\n3\ne.g. for complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis and complicated intra-abdominal infections \n\nthe recommended treatment duration is 5 to 10 days. For hospital-acquired pneumonia including ventilator-\n\nassociated pneumonia the recommended treatment duration is 7 to 14 days. Treatment up to 21 days may be \n\nrequired. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nTable 2 Recommended dose of Fetcroja for patients with a CrCl < 90 ml/min\n1\n \n\nRenal function Dose Frequency \n\nMild renal impairment 2 g Every 8 hours \n\n(CrCL \u226560 to < 90 mL/min) \nModerate renal impairment 1.5 g Every 8 hours \n\n(CrCL \u226530 to < 60 mL/min) \n\nSevere renal impairment 1 g Every 8 hours \n\n(CrCL \u226515 to < 30 mL/min) \nEnd stage renal disease 0.75 g Every 12 hours \n\n (CrCL < 15 mL/min)  \n\nPatient with intermittent haemodialysis\n2\n 0.75 g Every 12 hours \n\n \n\n1\nAs calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. \n\n2\nAs cefiderocol is removed by haemodialysis, administer cefiderocol at the earliest possible time after \n\ncompletion of haemodialysis on haemodialysis days. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\nNo dosage adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Fetcroja in children below 18 years of age has not yet been established. No \n\ndata are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nIntravenous use. \n\nFetcroja is administered by intravenous infusion over 3 hours. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to any cephalosporin antibacterial medicinal product. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nSevere hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of beta-\n\nlactam antibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins, monobactams or carbapenems). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity has been reported with cefiderocol (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients who have a history of hypersensitivity to carbapenems, penicillins or other beta-lactam \n\nantibacterial medicinal products may also be hypersensitive to cefiderocol. Before initiating therapy \n\nwith Fetcroja, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to beta-\n\nlactam antibiotics (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIf a severe allergic reaction occurs, treatment with Fetcroja must be discontinued immediately and \n\nadequate emergency measures must be initiated. \n\n \n\nClostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea \n\n \n\nClostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been reported with cefiderocol (see section \n\n4.8). The condition can range in severity from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis and should be considered \n\nin patients who present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of cefiderocol. \n\nDiscontinuation of therapy with cefiderocol and the use of supportive measures together with the \n\nadministration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be considered. Medicinal \n\nproducts that inhibit peristalsis should not be given. \n\n \n\nSeizure \n\n \n\nCephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures. Patients with known seizure disorders \n\nshould continue anticonvulsant therapy. Patients who develop focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures \n\nshould be evaluated neurologically and placed on anticonvulsant therapy if not already instituted. If \n\nnecessary, the dose of cefiderocol should be adjusted based on renal function (see section 4.2). \n\nAlternatively, cefiderocol should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nLimitations of the clinical data \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, cefiderocol has only been used to treat patients with the following types of infection: \n\ncomplicated urinary tract infections (cUTI); hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated \n\npneumonia (VAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP); sepsis and patients with bacteraemia \n\n(some with no identified primary focus of infection). \n\n \n\nThe use of cefiderocol to treat patients with infections due to Gram-negative aerobic pathogens who \n\nhave limited treatment options is based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses for \n\ncefiderocol and on limited clinical data from a randomized clinical trial in which 80 patients were \n\ntreated with Fetcroja and 38 patients were treated with best available therapy for infections caused by \n\ncarbapenem-resistant organisms. \n\n \n\nAll-cause mortality in patients with infections due to carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria \n\n \n\nA higher all-cause mortality rate was observed in patients treated with cefiderocol as compared to best \n\navailable therapy (BAT) in a randomised, open-label trial in critically-ill patients with infections \n\nknown or suspected to be due to carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The higher day 28 all-\n\ncause mortality rate with cefiderocol occurred in patients treated for nosocomial pneumonia, \n\nbacteraemia and/or sepsis [25/101 (24.8%) vs. 9/49 (18.4%) with BAT; treatment difference 6.4%, \n\n95% CI (-8.6, 19.2)]. All-cause mortality remained higher in patients treated with cefiderocol through \n\nend-of-study [34/101 (33.7%) vs. 9/49 (18.4%) with BAT; treatment difference 15.3%, 95% CI (-0.2, \n\n28.6)]. The cause of the increase in mortality has not been established. In the cefiderocol group there \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nwas an association between mortality and infection with Acinetobacter spp., which accounted for the \n\nmajority of infections due to non-fermenters. In contrast, mortality was not higher in cefiderocol vs. \n\nBAT patients with infections due to other non-fermenters. \n\n \n\nSpectrum of activity of cefiderocol \n\n \n\nCefiderocol has little or no activity against the majority of Gram-positive organisms and anaerobes \n\n(see section 5.1). Additional antibacterial medicinal products should be used when these pathogens are \n\nknown or suspected to be contributing to the infectious process. \n\n \n\nNon-susceptible organisms \n\n \n\nThe use of cefiderocol may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, which may require \n\ninterruption of treatment or other appropriate measures. \n\n \n\nRenal function monitoring \n\n \n\nRenal function should be monitored regularly as dose adjustment may be needed during the course of \n\ntherapy. \n\n \n\nDrug/laboratory test interactions \n\n \n\nCefiderocol may result in false-positive results in urine dipstick tests (urine protein, ketones, or occult \n\nblood). Alternative methods of testing should be used by the clinical laboratories to confirm positive \n\ntests. \n\n \n\nAntiglobulin test (Coombs test) seroconversion \n\n \n\nA positive direct or indirect Coombs test may develop during treatment with cefiderocol. \n\n \n\nControlled sodium diet \n\n \n\nEach 1 g vial contains 7.64 mmol of sodium (approximately 176 mg).  \n\n \n\nEach 2 g dose of cefiderocol, when reconstituted with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, \n\nprovides 30.67 mmol (705 mg) of sodium and is approximately 35% of the WHO adult recommended \n\nmaximum daily dietary intake. The total daily dose (2 g administered 3 times a day) of sodium from \n\ncefiderocol therapy is 2.1 g, just greater than the WHO recommend daily maximum of 2 g sodium for \n\nan adult. \n\n \n\nWhen reconstituted in 100 mL of 5% dextrose injection each 2 g dose of cefiderocol provides \n\n15.28 mmol (352 mg) of sodium. The total daily sodium dose (2 g administered 3 times a day) from \n\ncefiderocol reconstituted in 5% dextrose injection is 1,056 mg which is approximately 53% of the \n\nWHO adult recommended maximum daily dietary intake of 2 g sodium. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nCefiderocol induces CYP3A4 in vitro. Therefore, the metabolism of co-administered medicinal \n\nproducts that are substrates of CYP3A4 can increase and lead to decreased systemic exposure of these \n\nmedicinal products. If cefiderocol is administered together with substrates of CYP3A4, the patients \n\nshould be monitored for decreased efficacy of the concomitant drug. \n\n \n\nAs the in vitro CYP3A4 induction by cefiderocol is PXR mediated, other PXR inducible proteins may \n\nalso be induced, for example the CYP2C family and PgP. The clinical relevance of this induction is \n\nunknown. As a consequence, if cefiderocol is administered together with substrates of the CYP2C \n\nfamily or PgP, the patients should be monitored for decreased efficacy of the concomitant drug. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nBased on in vitro studies and one phase 1 clinical evaluation no significant drug-drug interactions are \n\nanticipated between cefiderocol and substrates or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) or \n\ngut, renal or hepatic drug transporters (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of cefiderocol \n\nsodium in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with \n\nrespect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid \n\nthe use of Fetcroja during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether Fetcroja/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A decision must be made \n\nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Fetcroja therapy taking into \n\naccount the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe effect of cefiderocol on fertility in humans has not been studied. Based on preclinical data, from a \n\nstudy with sub-clinical exposure, there is no evidence that Fetcroja has an effect on male or female \n\nfertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nFetcroja has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions were diarrhoea (8.2%), vomiting (3.6%), nausea (3.3%) and \n\ncough (2%).  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with cefiderocol during clinical studies (Table 3). \n\nAdverse reactions are classified according to frequency and System Organ Class (SOC). Frequency \n\ncategories are defined as: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each System Organ Class, undesirable effects are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 3  Tabulated list of adverse reactions  \n\nSystem organ \n\nclass  \n\nCommon Uncommon \n\n(\u22651/100 to <1/10) (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\nCandidiasis including oral candidiasis, \n\nvulvovaginal candidiasis, candiduria and \n\ncandida infection, \n\nClostridioides difficile colitis including \n\npseudomembranous colitis and \n\nClostridioides difficile infection \n\n \n\nImmune System \n\nDisorders \n\n Hypersensitivity including skin \n\nreactions and Pruritus \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nRespiratory, \n\nthoracic and \n\nmediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nCough   \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting  \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nRash including rash macular, rash maculo-\n\npapular, rash erythematous and drug \n\neruption \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\ndisorders and \n\nadministration \n\nsite conditions \n\n \n\nInfusion site reaction including infusion \n\nsite pain, injection site pain, infusion site \n\nerythema and injection site phlebitis \n\n \n\nInvestigations Alanine aminotransferase  increased, \n\nGamma-glutamyltransferase  increased, \n\nAspartate aminotransferase  increased, \n\nHepatic function abnormal including liver \n\nfunction test increased, hepatic enzyme \n\nincreased, transaminases increased and \n\nliver function test abnormal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no information on clinical signs and symptoms associated with an overdose of cefiderocol.  \n\n \n\nIn the event of overdose, patients should be monitored and treatment discontinuation and general \n\nsupportive treatment should be considered.  \n\n \n\nApproximately 60% of cefiderocol is removed by a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use. ATC code: J01DI04 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nCefiderocol is a siderophore cephalosporin. In addition to passive diffusion through outer membrane \n\nporin channels, cefiderocol is able to bind to extracellular free iron via its siderophore side chain, \n\nallowing active transport into the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria through siderophore \n\nuptake systems. Cefiderocol subsequently binds to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs), inhibiting \n\nbacterial peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis which leads to cell lysis and death. \n\n \n\nResistance \n\n \n\nMechanisms of bacterial resistance that may lead to resistance to cefiderocol include mutant or \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nacquired PBPs; beta-lactamase enzymes with ability to hydrolyse cefiderocol; mutations affecting \n\nregulation of bacterial iron uptake; mutations in siderophore transport proteins; overexpression of \n\nnative bacterial siderophores. \n\n \n\nThe in vitro antibacterial activity effect of cefiderocol against normally susceptible species is not \n\naffected by the majority of beta-lactamases, including metallo-enzymes. Due to the siderophore-\n\nmediated mode of cell entry, the in vitro activity of cefiderocol activity is generally less affected by \n\nporin loss or efflux-mediated resistance compared to many other beta-lactam agents. \n\n \n\nCefiderocol has little or no activity against Gram-positive or anaerobic bacteria due to intrinsic \n\nresistance. \n\n \n\nAntibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated no antagonism between cefiderocol and amikacin, \n\nceftazidime/avibactam, ceftolozane/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, colistin, daptomycin, \n\nlinezolid, meropenem, metronidazole, tigecycline, or vancomycin. \n\n \n\nSusceptibility testing breakpoints \n\n \n\nMinimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on \n\nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for cefiderocol are as follows: \n\n \n\n Minimum inhibitory concentrations (mg/L) \n\nOrganisms Susceptible Resistant \n\nEnterobacterales \u22642 >2 \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \u22642 >2 \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n\n \n\nThe time that unbound plasma concentrations of cefiderocol exceeds the minimum inhibitory \n\nconcentration (%fT>MIC) against the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy. \n\n \n\nAntibacterial activity against specific pathogens \n\n \n\nIn-vitro studies suggest that the following pathogens would be susceptible to cefiderocol in the \n\nabsence of acquired mechanisms of resistance: \n\n \n\nAerobic Gram-negative organisms \n\nAchromobacter spp. \n\nAcinetobacter baumannii complex \n\nBurkholderia cepacia complex \n\nCitrobacter freundii complex \n\nCitrobacter koseri \n\nEscherichia coli \n\nEnterobacter cloacae complex \n\nKlebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes \n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae \n\nKlebsiella oxytoca \n\nMorganella morganii \n\nProteus mirabilis \n\nProteus vulgaris \n\nProvidencia rettgeri \n\nSerratia spp. \n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa \n\nSerratia marcescens \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nStenotrophomonas maltophilia \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that the following species are not susceptible to cefiderocol: \n\n \n\nAerobic Gram-positive organisms \n\nAnaerobic organisms \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nFetcroja in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of infections due to \n\naerobic Gram-negative bacteria (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAfter multiple dose administration of cefiderocol, there is no accumulation of cefiderocol administered \n\nevery 8 hours in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe binding of cefiderocol to human plasma proteins, primarily albumin, is in the range of 40 to 60%, \n\nthe geometric mean (CV%) volume of distribution during the terminal phase of cefiderocol in healthy \n\nadult subjects (n = 43) after intravenous administration of a single 2 g dose of cefiderocol was 18.0 L \n\n(18.1%), similar to extracellular fluid volume. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nAfter administration of a single 1 g dose of [\n14\n\nC]-labelled cefiderocol infused over 1 hour, cefiderocol \n\naccounted for 92.3% of the plasma AUC for total radioactivity. The most predominant metabolite, \n\npyrrolidine chlorobenzamide (PCBA, which is a degradation product of cefiderocol), accounted for \n\n4.7% of the plasma AUC for total radioactivity, while other more minor metabolites each accounted \n\nfor < 2% of the plasma AUC for total radioactivity. \n\n \n\nInteraction with other medicinal products. \n\nCo-administration with 2 g doses of cefiderocol given every 8 hours did not affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of furosemide (a OAT1 and OAT3 substrate) or metformin (a OCT1, OCT2, and \n\nMATE2-K substrate). Co-administration with 2 g doses of cefiderocol given every 8 hours increased \n\nrosuvastatin (a OATP1B3 substrate) AUC by 21%, which was considered not to be clinically \n\nmeaningful. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe terminal elimination half-life in healthy adult subjects was 2 to 3 hours. The geometric mean \n\n(%CV) of clearance of cefiderocol in healthy subjects is estimated to be 5.18 (17.2%) L/hr. \n\nCefiderocol is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. After administration of a single 1 g dose of [\n14\n\nC]-\n\nlabelled cefiderocol infused over 1 hour, the amount of total radioactivity excreted in urine was 98.6% \n\nof the administered dose, with 2.8% of the administered dose excreted in faeces. The amount of \n\nunchanged cefiderocol excreted in urine was 90.6% of the administered dose.  \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nCefiderocol exhibits linear pharmacokinetics within the dose range of 100 mg to 4000 mg. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \n\ncefiderocol was observed with respect to age, gender or race. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with cefiderocol in infants and children under 18 \n\nyears of age (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of cefiderocol after administration of a single 1 g dose was assessed in subjects \n\nwith mild renal impairment (n=8, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 60 to < 90 \n\nmL/min/1.73 m\n2\n), moderate renal impairment (n=7, eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n), severe renal \n\nimpairment (n=6, eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n2\n), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \n\nhaemodialysis (n=8), and healthy subjects with normal renal function (n=8, estimated creatinine \n\nclearance of at least 90 mL/min).  The geometric mean ratios (GMR; mild, moderate, severe or ESRD \n\nwithout haemodialysis/normal renal function) and 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the AUC of \n\ncefiderocol were 1.0 (0.8, 1.3), 1.5 (1.2, 1.9), 2.5 (2.0, 3.3) and 4.1 (3.3, 5.2), respectively.  \n\nApproximately 60% of Fetcroja was removed by a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose adjustments in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment are expected \n\nto provide comparable exposures to subjects with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (see \n\nsection 4.2).  \n\n \n\nPatients with augmented renal clearance \n\nSimulations using the population PK model demonstrated that the recommended dose adjustment for \n\nARC provide exposures, including %T>MIC, of Fetcroja comparable to those in patients with normal \n\nrenal function.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nHepatic impairment is not expected to alter the elimination of Fetcroja as hepatic \n\nmetabolism/excretion represent a minor pathway of elimination of Fetcroja.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies with cefiderocol have not been conducted. \n\n \n\nCefiderocol was negative for mutagenicity in an in vitro reverse mutation test with bacteria and in the \n\nin vitro HPRT gene mutation assay in human cells. Positive findings were seen in an in vitro \n\nchromosomal aberration test in cultured TK6 cells and an in vitro mouse lymphoma assay (MLA). \n\nThere was no evidence of in vivo genotoxicity (rat micronucleus assay and comet assay in rats).  \n\n \n\nCefiderocol had no impairment of fertility and early embryonic development in rats treated with \n\ncefiderocol intravenously up to 1000 mg/kg/day corresponding to a margin to clinical exposure of 0.8. \n\nThere was no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity in rats or mice that received 1000 \n\nmg/kg/day or 2000 mg/kg/day respectively corresponding to margins to clinical exposure of 0.9 \n\nand 1.3 \n\n \n\nCefiderocol had no adverse effects on growth and development, including neurobehavioural function \n\nin juvenile rats that received 1000 mg/kg/day subcutaneously during postnatal day (PND)7 to PND27, \n\nor 600 mg/kg/day intravenously from PND28 to PND48. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects, you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects.  \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Fetcroja is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Fetcroja \n\n3. How Fetcroja is used \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Fetcroja  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Fetcroja is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nFetcroja contains the active substance cefiderocol. It is an antibiotic medicine that belongs to a group \n\nof antibiotics called cephalosporins. Antibiotics help to fight bacteria that cause infections.  \n\n \n\nFetcroja is used in adults to treat infections caused by certain types of bacteria when other antibiotics \n\ncannot be used.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Fetcroja  \n\n \n\nDo not use Fetcroja \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to cefiderocol or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6); \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to other antibiotics known as cephalosporins; \n\uf0b7 if you have had a severe allergic reaction to certain antibiotics, such as penicillins or \n\ncarbapenems. This can include severe skin peeling, swelling of the hands, face, feet, lips, tongue \n\nor throat; or difficulty swallowing or breathing.  \n\n\u2794 Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Fetcroja: \n\n\uf0b7 if you have ever had any allergic reaction to other antibiotics. See also section above, \u201cDo not \nuse Fetcroja\u201d; \n\n\uf0b7 if you have kidney problems. Your doctor will adjust your dose to ensure you don\u2019t get too much \nor too little medicine; \n\n\uf0b7 if you suffer from diarrhoea during your treatment; \n\uf0b7 if you are on a low sodium diet; \n\uf0b7 if you have ever had seizures. \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n\u2794 Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Fetcroja. \n\n \n\nNew Infection \n\nAlthough Fetcroja can fight certain bacteria, there is a possibility that you may get a different infection \n\ncaused by another organism during or after your treatment. Your doctor will monitor you closely for \n\nany new infections and give you another treatment if necessary. \n\n \n\nBlood/laboratory Tests \n\nTell your doctor that you are taking Fetcroja if you are going to have any blood/laboratory tests. This \n\nis because you may get an abnormal result. With something called a \u201cCoombs test\u201d this looks for the \npresence of antibodies that can destroy red blood cells or may be affected by the response of your \n\nimmune system to Fetcroja. Fetcroja may also result in false-positive results in urine dipstick tests \n\n(urine protein or diabetes markers). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nFetcroja should not be given to children and adolescents under the age of 18. This is because it is not \n\nknown if the medicine is safe to use in these age groups. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Fetcroja \n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nFetcroja does not affect your ability to drive or operate machinery. \n\n \n\nFetcroja contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains 7.64 mmol (176 mg) of sodium per vial. The total daily dose is 2.1 g, just \n\ngreater than the WHO recommend daily maximum of 2 g sodium for an adult. Talk to your doctor \n\nbefore you are given Fetcroja if you are on a low sodium diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Fetcroja is used \n\n \n\nYour doctor or nurse will give you this medicine as an infusion (a drip) into your vein over 3 hours, \n\nthree times a day. The usual recommended dose is 2 g. \n\n \n\nThe number of days you will be given Fetcroja treatment depends on the type of infection you have \n\nand how well your infection is clearing. \n\n \n\nIf you get any pain where the Fetcroja infusion goes into your vein, tell your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\nPeople with kidney problems \n\nIf you have kidney problems, talk to your doctor before you are given Fetcroja. The doctor will adjust \n\nyour dose of Fetcroja. \n\n \n\nIf you are given more Fetcroja than you should \n\nFetcroja will be given to you by a doctor or nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong dose. \n\nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you think you have been given more Fetcroja than you \n\nshould have. \n\n \n\nIf you miss a dose of Fetcroja  \n\nIf you think you have not been given a dose of Fetcroja, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSerious side effects \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects \u2013 you may need \nurgent medical treatment: \n\n\uf0b7 Severe allergic reaction \u2013 signs include sudden swelling of your lips, face, throat or tongue; a \nsevere rash or other severe skin reactions; difficulty swallowing or breathing. This reaction may be \n\nlife-threatening. \n\n\uf0b7 Diarrhoea that gets worse or does not go away, or stools that contain blood or mucus. This may \nhappen during treatment, or after it has been stopped. If this happens, do not take medicines that \n\nstop or slow bowel movement. \n\n\u2794 Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the serious side effects above.  \n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects. \n\n \n\nCommon \n\n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n\uf0b7 Feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) \n\uf0b7 Swelling, redness and/or pain around the needle where the medicine is given into a vein \n\uf0b7 Yeast infections e.g. thrush \n\uf0b7 Increase in levels of liver enzymes, shown in blood tests \n\uf0b7 Cough \n\uf0b7 Rash, with small raised bumps \n\uf0b7 Severe gut infection known as Clostridioides difficile colitis. Symptoms include watery diarrhoea, \n\nabdominal pain, fever, etc. \n\n \n\nUncommon \n\n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n\uf0b7 Allergy to Fetcroja \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \n\nAppendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Fetcroja \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label. The expiry date refers to the \n\nlast day of that month. \n\n \n\nStore unopened vials in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \n\n \n\nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicnes you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n6.
