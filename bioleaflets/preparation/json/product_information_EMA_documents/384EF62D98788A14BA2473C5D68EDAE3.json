NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nDuoTrav 40 micrograms/mL + 5 mg/mL eye drops, solution \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach mL of solution contains 40 micrograms of travoprost and 5 mg of timolol (as timolol maleate). \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect \n\n \n\nEach mL of solution contains polyquaternium-1 (POLYQUAD) 10 microgram, propylene glycol 5 mg \n\nand polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 1 mg (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nEye drops, solution (eye drops). \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDuoTrav is indicated in adults for the decrease of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with \n\nopen-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to topical beta blockers \n\nor prostaglandin analogues (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nUse in adults, including the elderly \n\nThe dose is one drop of DuoTrav in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily, in the \n\nmorning or evening. It should be administered at the same time each day. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. The dose should not \n\nexceed one drop in the affected eye(s) daily. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nHepatic and renal impairment \n\nNo studies have been conducted with DuoTrav or with timolol 5 mg/mL eye drops in patients with \n\nhepatic or renal impairment. \n\n \n\nTravoprost has been studied in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment and in patients with \n\nmild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance as low as 14 mL/min). No dose adjustment was \n\nnecessary in these patients. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment are unlikely to require dose adjustment with DuoTrav (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of DuoTrav in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not \n\nbeen established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor ocular use. \n\n \n\nThe patient should remove the protective overwrap immediately prior to initial use. To prevent \n\ncontamination of the dropper tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, surrounding \n\nareas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. \n\n \n\nWhen nasolacrimal occlusion is used or the eyelids are closed for 2 minutes, systemic absorption is \n\nreduced. This may result in a decrease in systemic side effects and an increase in local activity (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be \n\nadministered at least 5 minutes apart (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nWhen substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma medicinal product with DuoTrav, the other \n\nmedicinal product should be discontinued and DuoTrav should be started the following day. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to remove soft contact lenses prior to application of DuoTrav and wait \n\n15 minutes after instillation of the dose before reinsertion (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nHypersensitivity to other beta blockers. \n\nReactive airway disease including bronchial asthma, or a history of bronchial asthma, severe chronic \n\nobstructive pulmonary disease. \n\nSinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, including sino-atrial block, second- or third-degree \n\natrioventricular block not controlled with pacemaker. Overt cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock. Severe \n\nallergic rhinitis and corneal dystrophies. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nSystemic effects \n\n \n\nLike other topically applied ophthalmic agents, travoprost and timolol are absorbed systemically. Due \n\nto the beta-adrenergic component, timolol, the same types of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other \n\nadverse reactions seen with systemic beta-adrenergic blocking medicinal products may occur. The \n\nincidence of systemic ADRs after topical ophthalmic administration is lower than for systemic \n\nadministration. For information on how to reduce systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n \n\nIn patients with cardiovascular diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease, Prinzmetal’s angina and cardiac \n\nfailure) and hypotension, therapy with beta blockers should be critically assessed and therapy with \n\nother active substances should be considered. Patients with cardiovascular diseases should be watched \n\nfor signs of deterioration of these diseases and of adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nDue to their negative effect on conduction time, beta blockers should only be given with caution to \n\npatients with first-degree heart block. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nVascular disorders \n\n \n\nPatients with severe peripheral circulatory disturbance/disorders (i.e. severe forms of Raynaud’s \n\ndisease or Raynaud’s syndrome) should be treated with caution. \n\n \n\nRespiratory disorders \n\n \n\nRespiratory reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, have been \n\nreported following administration of some ophthalmic beta blockers. \n\n \n\nDuoTrav should be used with caution in patients with mild/moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary \n\ndisease (COPD) and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia/diabetes \n\n \n\nBeta blockers should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycaemia \n\nor in patients with labile diabetes, as beta blockers may mask the signs and symptoms of acute \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMuscle weakness \n\n \n\nBeta-adrenergic blocking medicinal products have been reported to potentiate muscle weakness \n\nconsistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g. diplopia, ptosis and generalised weakness). \n\n \n\nCorneal diseases \n\n \n\nOphthalmic beta blockers may induce dryness of eyes. Patients with corneal diseases should be treated \n\nwith caution. \n\n \n\nChoroidal detachment \n\n \n\nChoroidal detachment has been reported with administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g. \n\ntimolol, acetazolamide) after filtration procedures. \n\n \n\nOther beta-blocking agents \n\n \n\nThe effect on intra-ocular pressure or the known effects of systemic beta blockade may be potentiated \n\nwhen timolol is given to patients already receiving a systemic beta-blocking medicinal product. The \n\nresponse of these patients should be closely observed. The use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking \n\nagents is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nSurgical anaesthesia \n\n \n\nBeta-blocking ophthalmological preparations may block systemic beta-agonist effects, e.g. of \n\nadrenaline. The anaesthetist should be informed when the patient is receiving timolol. \n\n \n\nHyperthyroidism \n\n \n\nBeta blockers may mask the signs of hyperthyroidism. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSkin contact \n\n \n\nProstaglandins and prostaglandin analogues are biologically active substances that may be absorbed \n\nthrough the skin. Women who are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant should exercise \n\nappropriate precautions to avoid direct exposure to the contents of the bottle. In the unlikely event of \n\ncoming in contact with a substantial portion of the contents of the bottle, thoroughly cleanse the \n\nexposed area immediately. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions \n\n \n\nWhile taking beta blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction \n\nto a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge with such allergens and \n\nunresponsive to the usual dose of adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions. \n\n \n\nConcomitant therapy \n\n \n\nTimolol may interact with other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe use of two local prostaglandins is not recommended. \n\n \n\nOcular effects \n\n \n\nTravoprost may gradually change the eye colour by increasing the number of melanosomes (pigment \n\ngranules) in melanocytes. Before treatment is instituted, patients must be informed of the possibility of \n\na permanent change in eye colour. Unilateral treatment can result in permanent heterochromia. The \n\nlong-term effects on the melanocytes and any consequences thereof are currently unknown. The \n\nchange in iris colour occurs slowly and may not be noticeable for months to years. The change in eye \n\ncolour has predominantly been seen in patients with mixed coloured irides, i.e. blue-brown, \n\ngrey-brown, yellow-brown and green-brown; however, it has also been observed in patients with \n\nbrown eyes. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the \n\nperiphery in affected eyes, but the entire iris or parts of it may become more brownish. After \n\ndiscontinuation of therapy, no further increase in brown iris pigment has been observed. \n\n \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, periorbital and/or eyelid skin darkening in association with the use of \n\ntravoprost has been reported. \n\n \n\nPeriorbital and lid changes, including deepening of the eyelid sulcus, have been observed with \n\nprostaglandin analogues. \n\n \n\nTravoprost may gradually change eyelashes in the treated eye(s); these changes were observed in \n\nabout half of the patients in clinical trials and include: increased length, thickness, pigmentation, \n\nand/or number of lashes. The mechanism of eyelash changes and their long-term consequences are \n\ncurrently unknown. \n\n \n\nTravoprost has been shown to cause slight enlargement of the palpebral fissure in studies in the \n\nmonkey. However, this effect was not observed during the clinical trials and is considered to be \n\nspecies specific. \n\n \n\nThere is no experience of DuoTrav in inflammatory ocular conditions, nor in neovascular, \n\nangle-closure, narrow-angle or congenital glaucoma, and only limited experience in thyroid eye \n\ndisease, in open-angle glaucoma of pseudophakic patients and in pigmentary or pseudoexfoliative \n\nglaucoma. \n\n \n\nMacular oedema has been reported during treatment with prostaglandin F2 analogues. Caution is \n\nrecommended when using DuoTrav in aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior \n\nlens capsule or anterior chamber lenses, or in patients with known risk factors for cystoid macular \n\noedema. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nIn patients with known predisposing risk factors for iritis/uveitis, and in patients with active \n\nintraocular inflammation, DuoTrav can be used with caution. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nDuoTrav contains propylene glycol which may cause skin irritation. \n\n \n\nDuoTrav contains polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 which may cause skin reactions. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to application of DuoTrav and wait \n\n15 minutes after instillation of the dose before reinsertion (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo specific drug interaction studies have been performed with travoprost or timolol. \n\n \n\nThere is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension and/or marked bradycardia when \n\nophthalmic beta-blocker solution is administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers, \n\nbeta-adrenergic blocking agents, antiarrhythmics (including amiodarone), digitalis glycosides, \n\nparasympathomimetics or guanethidine. \n\n \n\nThe hypertensive reaction to sudden withdrawal of clonidine can be potentiated when taking beta \n\nblockers. \n\n \n\nPotentiated systemic beta blockade (e.g. decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during \n\ncombined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) and timolol. \n\n \n\nMydriasis resulting from concomitant use of ophthalmic beta blockers and adrenaline (epinephrine) \n\nhas been reported occasionally. \n\n \n\nBeta blockers may increase the hypoglycaemic effect of antidiabetic medicinal products. Beta blockers \n\ncan mask the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \n\n \n\nDuoTrav must not be used in women of child-bearing age/potential unless adequate contraceptive \n\nmeasures are in place (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nTravoprost has harmful pharmacological effects on pregnancy and/or the foetus/newborn child. \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of DuoTrav or the individual components in \n\npregnant women. Timolol should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\nEpidemiological studies have not revealed malformative effects but show a risk for intrauterine growth \n\nretardation when beta blockers are administered by the oral route. In addition, signs and symptoms of \n\nbeta blockade (e.g. bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress and hypoglycaemia) have been \n\nobserved in the neonate when beta blockers have been administered until delivery. If DuoTrav is \n\nadministered until delivery, the neonate should be carefully monitored during the first days of life. \n\n \n\nDuoTrav should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. For information on how to \n\nreduce systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether travoprost from eye drops is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies \n\nhave shown excretion of travoprost and metabolites in breast milk. Timolol is excreted in breast milk \n\nand has the potential to cause serious adverse reactions in the breast-fed infant. However, at \n\ntherapeutic doses of timolol in eye drops it is not likely that sufficient amounts would be present in \n\nbreast milk to produce clinical symptoms of beta blockade in the infant. For information on how to \n\nreduce systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n\n \n\nThe use of DuoTrav by breast-feeding women is not recommended. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the effects of DuoTrav on human fertility. Animal studies showed no effect of \n\ntravoprost on fertility at doses up to 75 times the maximum recommended human ocular dose, whereas \n\nno relevant effect of timolol was noted at this dose level. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nDuoTrav has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nAs with any eye drops, temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may occur. If blurred \n\nvision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or using \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies involving 2,170 patients treated with DuoTrav the most frequently reported \n\ntreatment-related adverse reaction was ocular hyperaemia (12.0%). \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions listed in the table below were observed in clinical studies or with post-marketing \n\nexperience. They are ranked according to system organ class and classified according to the following \n\nconvention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n\n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata).

Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nA topical overdose with DuoTrav is not likely to occur or to be associated with toxicity. \n\n \n\nIn case of accidental ingestion, symptoms of overdose from systemic beta blockade may include \n\nbradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm and heart failure. \n\n \n\nIf overdose with DuoTrav occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Timolol does not \n\ndialyse readily. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals; Antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, ATC code: \n\nS01ED51. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nDuoTrav contains two active substances: travoprost and timolol maleate. These two components lower \n\nintraocular pressure by complementary mechanisms of action and the combined effect results in \n\nadditional IOP reduction compared to either compound alone. \n\n \n\nTravoprost, a prostaglandin F2α analogue, is a full agonist which is highly selective and has a high \n\naffinity for the prostaglandin FP receptor, and reduces the intraocular pressure by increasing the \n\noutflow of aqueous humour via trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways. Reduction of IOP in \n\nman starts within approximately 2 hours after administration and maximum effect is reached after \n\n12 hours. Significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods exceeding \n\n24 hours with a single dose. \n\n \n\nTimolol is a non-selective adrenergic blocking agent that has no intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct \n\nmyocardial depressant or membrane-stabilising activity. Tonography and fluorophotometry studies in \n\nman suggest that its predominant action is related to reduced aqueous humour formation and a slight \n\nincrease in outflow facility. \n\n \n\nSecondary pharmacology \n\n \n\nTravoprost significantly increased optic nerve head blood flow in rabbits following 7 days of topical \n\nocular administration (1.4 micrograms once daily). \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nClinical effects \n\nIn a twelve-month controlled clinical study in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular \n\nhypertension and baseline mean IOP of 25 to 27 mmHg, the mean IOP-lowering effect of DuoTrav \n\ndosed once daily in the morning was 8 to 10 mmHg. The non-inferiority of DuoTrav as compared to \n\nlatanoprost 50 micrograms/mL + timolol 5 mg/mL in the mean IOP reduction was demonstrated \n\nacross all time-points at all visits. \n\n \n\nIn a three-month controlled clinical study in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension \n\nand baseline mean IOP of 27 to 30 mmHg, the mean IOP-lowering effect of DuoTrav dosed once daily \n\nin the morning was 9 to 12 mmHg, and was up to 2 mmHg greater than that of travoprost \n\n40 micrograms/mL dosed once daily in the evening and 2 to 3 mmHg greater than that of timolol \n\n5 mg/mL dosed twice daily. A statistically superior reduction in morning mean IOP (08:00, 24 hours \n\nafter the last dose of DuoTrav) was observed compared to travoprost at all visits throughout the study. \n\n \n\nIn two three-month controlled clinical studies in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular \n\nhypertension and baseline mean IOP of 23 to 26 mmHg, the mean IOP-lowering effect of DuoTrav \n\ndosed once daily in the morning was 7 to 9 mmHg. Mean IOP reductions were non-inferior, although \n\nnumerically lower, to those achieved by concomitant therapy with travoprost 40 micrograms/mL \n\ndosed once daily in the evening and timolol 5 mg/mL dosed once daily in the morning. \n\n \n\nIn a 6-week controlled clinical study in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and \n\nbaseline mean IOP of 24 to 26 mmHg, the mean IOP-lowering effect of DuoTrav \n\n(polyquaternium-1-preserved) dosed once daily in the morning was 8 mmHg and equivalent to that of \n\nDuoTrav (benzalkonium chloride-preserved). \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nInclusion criteria were common across the studies, with the exception of the IOP entry criteria and \n\nresponse to previous IOP therapy. The clinical development of DuoTrav included both patients naive \n\nand on therapy. Insufficient responsiveness to monotherapy was not an inclusion criterion. \n\n \n\nExisting data suggest that evening dosing might have some advantages as regards mean IOP reduction. \n\nConsideration should be given to patient convenience and their likely compliance when \n\nrecommending morning vs. evening dosing. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nTravoprost and timolol are absorbed through the cornea. Travoprost is a prodrug that undergoes rapid \n\nester hydrolysis in the cornea to the active free acid. Following once-daily administration of DuoTrav \n\nPQ in healthy subjects (N=22) for 5 days, travoprost free acid was not quantifiable in plasma samples \n\nfrom the majority of subjects (94.4%) and generally was not detectable one hour after dosing. When \n\nmeasurable (0.01 ng/mL, the assay limit of quantitation), concentrations ranged from \n\n0.01 to 0.03 ng/mL. The mean timolol steady-state Cmax was 1.34 ng/ml and Tmax was approximately \n\n0.69 hours after once-daily administration of DuoTrav. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nTravoprost free acid can be measured in the aqueous humour during the first few hours in animals and \n\nin human plasma only during the first hour after ocular administration of DuoTrav. Timolol can be \n\nmeasured in human aqueous humour after ocular administration of timolol and in plasma for up to \n\n12 hours after ocular administration of DuoTrav. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nMetabolism is the major route of elimination of both travoprost and the active free acid. The systemic \n\nmetabolic pathways parallel those of endogenous prostaglandin F2 which are characterised by \n\nreduction of the 13-14 double bond, oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl and -oxidative cleavages of the \n\nupper side chain. \n\n \n\nTimolol is metabolised by two pathways. One route yields an ethanolamine side chain on the \n\nthiadiazole ring and the other gives an ethanolic side chain on the morpholine nitrogen and a second \n\nsimilar side chain with a carbonyl group adjacent to the nitrogen. The plasma t1/2 of timolol is 4 hours \n\nafter ocular administration of DuoTrav. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nTravoprost free acid and its metabolites are mainly excreted by the kidneys. Less than 2% of an ocular \n\ndose of travoprost was recovered in urine as free acid. Timolol and its metabolites are primarily \n\nexcreted by the kidneys. Approximately 20% of a timolol dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and \n\nthe remainder excreted in urine as metabolites. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nIn monkeys, administration of DuoTrav twice daily was shown to induce increased palpebral fissure \n\nand to increase iris pigmentation similar to that observed with ocular administration of prostanoids. \n\n \n\nDuoTrav preserved with polyquaternium-1 induced minimal ocular surface toxicity, compared to eye \n\ndrops preserved with benzalkonium chloride, on cultured human corneal cells and following topical \n\nocular administration in rabbits. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTravoprost \n\n \n\nTopical ocular administration of travoprost to monkeys at concentrations of up to 0.012% to the right \n\neye, twice daily for one year resulted in no systemic toxicity. \n\n \n\nReproduction toxicity studies with travoprost have been undertaken in rats, mice and rabbits using the \n\nsystemic route. Findings are related to FP receptor agonist activity in uterus with early \n\nembryolethality, post-implantation loss and foetotoxicity. In pregnant rats, systemic administration of \n\ntravoprost at doses more than 200 times the clinical dose during the period of organogenesis resulted \n\nin an increased incidence of malformations. Low levels of radioactivity were measured in amniotic \n\nfluid and foetal tissues of pregnant rats administered \n3\nH-travoprost. Reproduction and development \n\nstudies have demonstrated a potent effect on foetal loss with a high rate observed in rats and mice \n\n(180 pg/mL and 30 pg/mL plasma, respectively) at exposures 1.2 to 6 times the clinical exposure (up \n\nto 25 pg/mL). \n\n \n\nTimolol \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans with timolol based on conventional studies of \n\nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. Reproduction \n\ntoxicity studies with timolol showed delayed foetal ossification in rats with no adverse effects on \n\npostnatal development (7000 times the clinical dose) and increased foetal resorptions in rabbits \n\n(14000 times the clinical dose). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What DuoTrav is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nDuoTrav eye drop solution is a combination of two active substances (travoprost and timolol). \n\nTravoprost is a prostaglandin analogue which works by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from \n\nthe eye, which lowers its pressure. Timolol is a beta blocker which works by reducing the production \n\nof fluid within the eye. The two substances work together to reduce pressure within the eye. \n\n \n\nDuoTrav eye drops are used to treat high pressure in the eye in adults, including the elderly. This \n\npressure can lead to an illness called glaucoma. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use DuoTrav \n\n \n\nDo not use DuoTrav \n\n if you are allergic to travoprost, prostaglandins, timolol, beta blockers or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n if you have now or have had in the past respiratory problems such as asthma, severe chronic \nobstructive bronchitis (severe lung disease which may cause wheeziness, difficulty in breathing \n\nand/or long-standing cough), or other types of breathing problems. \n\n if you have severe hay fever. \n\n if you have a slow heartbeat, heart failure or a disorder of heart rhythm (irregular heartbeat). \n\n if the surface of your eye is cloudy. \n \n\nAsk your doctor for advice if any of these applies to you. \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nWarning and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using DuoTrav if you have now or have had in the past \n\n coronary heart disease (symptoms can include chest pain or tightness, breathlessness or \nchoking), heart failure, low blood pressure. \n\n disturbances of heart rate such as slow heartbeat. \n\n breathing problems, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \n\n poor blood circulation disease (such as Raynaud’s disease or Raynaud’s syndrome). \n\n diabetes (as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of low blood sugar). \n\n overactivity of the thyroid gland (as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of thyroid disease). \n\n myasthenia gravis (chronic neuromuscular weakness). \n\n cataract surgery. \n\n eye inflammation. \n \n\nIf you need to have any type of surgery, tell your doctor that you are using DuoTrav as timolol may \n\nchange the effects of some medicines used during anaesthesia. \n\n \n\nIf you get any severe allergic reaction (skin rash, redness and itching of the eye) while  using \n\nDuoTrav, whatever the cause, adrenaline treatment may not be as effective. It is therefore important to \n\ntell the doctor that you are using DuoTrav when you are to receive any other treatment. \n\n \n\nDuoTrav may change the colour of your iris (the coloured part of your eye). This change may be \n\npermanent. \n\n \n\nDuoTrav may increase the length, thickness, colour and/or number of your eyelashes and may cause \n\nunusual hair growth on your eyelids. \n\n \n\nTravoprost may be absorbed through the skin and therefore should not be used by women who are \n\npregnant or are attempting to become pregnant. If any of the medicine comes into contact with the skin \n\nthen it should be washed off straight away. \n\n \n\nChildren \n\nDuoTrav is not to be used by children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and DuoTrav \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nDuoTrav can affect or be affected by other medicines you are using, including other eye drops for the \n\ntreatment of glaucoma. Tell your doctor if you are using or intend to use medicines to lower blood \n\npressure, heart medicines including quinidine (used to treat heart conditions and some types of \n\nmalaria), medicines to treat diabetes or the antidepressants fluoxetine or paroxetine. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDo not use DuoTrav if you are pregnant unless your doctor considers it necessary. If you could get \n\npregnant you must use adequate contraception whilst you use the medicine. \n\n \n\nDo not use DuoTrav if you are breast-feeding. DuoTrav may get into your milk. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYou may find that your vision is blurred for a time just after you use DuoTrav. Do not drive or use \n\nmachines until this has worn off. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nDuoTrav contains hydrogenated castor oil and propylene glycol which may cause skin reactions \n\nand irritation. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use DuoTrav \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \n\nyou are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye or eyes once a day in the morning or in the \n\nevening. Use at the same time each day. \n\n \n\nOnly use DuoTrav in both eyes if your doctor told you to do so. \n\n \n\nOnly use DuoTrav as eye drops. \n\n \n\n    \n1 2 3 4 \n\n \n\n Immediately before using a bottle for the first time, tear open the overwrap (picture 1), remove \nthe bottle and write the date of opening on the label in the space provided. \n\n Make sure you have a mirror available. \n\n Wash your hands. \n\n Twist off the bottle cap. \n\n Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. \n\n Tilt your head back. Pull your lower eyelid down with a clean finger until there is a “pocket” \nbetween the eyelid and your eye. The drop will go in here (picture 2). \n\n Bring the bottle dropper close to the eye. Use the mirror if it helps. \n\n Do not touch your eye or eyelid, the surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It \ncould infect the drops. \n\n Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of DuoTrav at a time (picture 3). If a drop misses \nyour eye, try again. \n\n After using DuoTrav, press your finger into the corner of your eye by your nose for 2 minutes \n(picture 4). This helps to stop DuoTrav getting into the rest of the body. \n\n If you have to use DuoTrav in both eyes, repeat the above steps for your other eye. \n\n Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use. \n\n Only use one bottle at a time. Do not open the overwrap until you need to use the bottle. \n \n\nUse DuoTrav for as long as your doctor has told you to. \n\n \n\nIf you use more DuoTrav than you should \nIf you use more DuoTrav than you should, rinse it all out with warm water. Do not put in any more \n\ndrops until it is time for your next regular dose. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use DuoTrav \nIf you forget to use DuoTrav, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to \n\nmake up for the forgotten dose. The dose should not exceed one drop daily in the affected eye(s). \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nIf you stop using DuoTrav \nIf you stop using DuoTrav without speaking to your doctor the pressure in your eye will not be \n\ncontrolled, which could lead to loss of sight. \n\n \n\nIf you are using other eye drops in addition to DuoTrav, leave at least 5 minutes between applying \n\nDuoTrav and the other drops. \n\n \n\nIf you wear soft contact lenses do not use the drops with your lenses in. After using the drops wait \n\n15 minutes before putting your lenses back in. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nYou can usually carry on using the drops, unless the effects are serious. If you are worried, talk to a \n\ndoctor or pharmacist. Do not stop using DuoTrav without speaking to your doctor. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \nEffects in the eye \n\nEye redness. \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nEffects in the eye \n\nEye surface inflammation with surface damage, eye pain, blurred vision, abnormal vision, dry eye, \n\nitchy eye, eye discomfort, signs and symptoms of eye irritation (e.g. burning, stinging). \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nEffects in the eye \n\nInflammation of the eye surface, inflammation of the eyelid, swollen conjunctiva, increased growth of \n\neyelashes, iris inflammation, eye inflammation, sensitivity to light, reduced vision, tired eyes, eye \n\nallergy, eye swelling, increased tear production, eyelid redness, eyelid colour change, skin darkening \n\n(around the eye). \n\n \n\nGeneral side effects \n\nAllergic reaction to active substance, dizziness, headache, increased or decreased blood pressure, \n\nshortness of breath, excessive hair growth, drip at back of throat, skin inflammation and itching, \n\ndecreased heart rate. \n\n \n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \nEffects in the eye \n\nThinning of the eye surface, inflammation of the eyelid glands, broken blood vessel in the eye, eyelid \n\ncrusting, abnormally positioned eyelashes, abnormal growth of lashes. \n\n \n\nGeneral side effects \n\nNervousness, irregular heart rate, loss of hair, voice disorders, difficulty breathing, cough, throat \n\nirritation, hives, abnormal liver blood tests, skin discolouration, thirst, tiredness, discomfort inside of \n\nnose, coloured urine, pain in hands and feet. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \nEffects in the eye \n\nDroopy eyelid (making the eye stay half closed), sunken eyes (eyes appear more inset), changes in the \n\ncolour of the iris (coloured part of the eye). \n\n \n\nGeneral side effects \n\nRash, heart failure, chest pain, stroke, fainting, depression, asthma, increased heart rate, numbness or \n\ntingling sensation, palpitations, swelling in the lower limbs, bad taste. \n\n \n\nAdditionally: \nDuoTrav is a combination of two active substances, travoprost and timolol.
