NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEnviage 150 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate). \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet \n \nLight-pink, biconvex, round tablet, imprinted “IL” on one side and “NVR” on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe recommended dose of Enviage is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not \nadequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks (85-90%) after initiating therapy \nwith 150 mg once daily. \n \nEnviage may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1). \n \nEnviage should be taken with a light meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit \njuice should not be taken together with Enviage. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe renal impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nElderly patients (over 65 years) \nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric patients (below 18 years) \nEnviage is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of data on \nsafety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\n2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nHistory of angioedema with aliskiren. \n \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin, a highly potent P-gp inhibitor, and other potent P-\ngp inhibitors (quinidine, verapamil), is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients receiving other medicinal products inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and/or \nthose with reduced kidney function and/or diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of hyperkalaemia \nduring aliskiren therapy. \n \nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \nHeart Association [NYHA] functional class III-IV). \n \nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Enviage therapy should be stopped. \n \nAngioedema \nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema has been reported in patients \ntreated with aliskiren. If angioedema occurs, Enviage should be promptly discontinued and appropriate \ntherapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has \noccurred. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to ensure patient airways should be provided. \n \nSodium and/or volume depleted patients \nIn patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. those receiving high doses of diuretics) \nsymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Enviage. This condition should \nbe corrected prior to administration of Enviage, or the treatment should start under close medical \nsupervision. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn clinical studies Enviage has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \nimpairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and ≥ 177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \nmen and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min), history of dialysis, nephrotic \nsyndrome or renovascular hypertension. Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with \nsevere renal impairment due to the lack of safety information for Enviage. \n \nAs for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren \nis given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (eg. \ndue to blood loss, severe prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease or \nkidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in \nat-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal \nfailure occur, aliskiren should be promptly discontinued. \n \nRenal artery stenosis \nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Enviage in patients with unilateral or bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on the \nrenin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, \nwhen patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore, caution should be \nexercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n \nModerate P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg resulted in a 76% increase in \naliskiren AUC but P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole are expected to increase tissue concentrations  \n\n3 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nmore than plasma concentrations. Therefore caution should be exercised when aliskiren is \nadministered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEnviage has no known clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products commonly used to treat \nhypertension or diabetes. \n \nCompounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol, \natenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, ramipril and \nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n \nCo-administration of aliskiren with either valsartan (↓28%), metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or \ncimetidine (↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Enviage. When \nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state Enviage AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\nadministration of Enviage had no significant impact on atorvastatin, valsartan, metformin or \namlodipine pharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for Enviage or these co-administered \nmedicinal products is necessary. \n \nDigoxin bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Enviage. \n \nPreliminary data suggest that irbesartan may decrease Enviage AUC and Cmax. \n \nIn experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Enviage \nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \nbioavailability of Enviage. \n \nCYP450 interactions \nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic exposure \nof substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is metabolised \nminimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or induction of \nCYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-gp. Increased \naliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp can therefore \nbe expected (see P-glycoprotein interactions below). \n \nP-glycoprotein interactions \nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) \nmight therefore decrease the bioavailability of Enviage. Although this has not been investigated for \naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors \ncan increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue \nlevels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will likely depend \non the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n \nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n50%. \n \nModerate P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted in an 80% increase in \nplasma levels of aliskiren (AUC and Cmax). Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole \nco-administration enhances aliskiren gastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. The \nchange in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole is expected to be within the range \nthat would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice \nthe highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical \n\n4 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\ntrials. Yet, P-gp inhibitors are expected to increase tissue concentrations more than plasma \nconcentrations. Therefore, caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with \nketoconazole or other moderate pgp inhibitors (itraconazol, clarithromycin, telithromycin, \nerythromycin, amiodarone). \n \nP-gp potent inhibitors \nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. Therefore, concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent \ninhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nFurosemide \nWhen aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced \nby 28% and 49% respectively. It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when \ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible under-utilisation in clinical situations of \nvolume overload. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-\nhypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated \npatients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further \ndeterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. \nTherefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n \nPotassium and potassium-sparing diuretics \nBased on experience with the use of other substances that affect the renin-angiotensin system, \nconcomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \npotassium or other substances that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to \nincreases in serum potassium. If co-medication is considered necessary, caution is advisable. \n \nGrapefruit juice \nDue to the lack of data a potential interaction between grapefruit juice and aliskiren cannot be \nexcluded. Grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Enviage. \n \nWarfarin \nThe effects of Enviage on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n \nFood intake \nMeals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of Enviage substantially. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Enviage was not teratogenic in rats or \nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAS have been associated with \nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAS, \nEnviage should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become \npregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). Healthcare \nprofessionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAS should counsel women of childbearing \npotential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during \ntherapy, Enviage should be discontinued accordingly. \n \nLactation \nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Enviage was secreted in the milk of \nlactating rats. Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding. \n\n5 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nwhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness \nmay occasionally occur when taking any antihypertensive therapy. Enviage has negligible influence \non the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nEnviage has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for \nover 6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse reactions showed no \nassociation with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with Enviage resulted in \nan overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo up to 300 mg. Adverse reactions have \ngenerally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of \ntherapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is diarrhoea. \n \nThe incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.6%) and Enviage treated (0.9%) patients. \n \nThe adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, \nusing the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000, <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), including isolated reports. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1 \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n Common: Diarrhoea \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Uncommon: Rash \n Rare: Angioedema \n\n \nAngioedema has occurred during treatment with Enviage. In controlled clinical trials, angioedema \noccurred rarely during treatment with Enviage with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or \nhydrochlorothiazide. Cases of angioedema have also been reported in post-marketing experience \n(frequency unknown). In the event of any signs suggesting an allergic reaction (in particular \ndifficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or tongue) \npatients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n \nLaboratory findings \nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \nuncommonly associated with the administration of Enviage. In clinical studies in hypertensive \npatients, Enviage had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n \nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\nangiotensin system, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor \nblockers. \n \nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium were minor and infrequent in patients with essential \nhypertension treated with Enviage alone (0.9% compared to 0.6% with placebo). However, in one \nstudy where Enviage was used in combination with an ACEI in a diabetic population, increases in \nserum potassium were more frequent (5.5%). Therefore as with any agent acting on the RAS system, \nroutine monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is indicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, \nkidney disease, or heart failure. \n\n6 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited data are available related to overdose in humans. The most likely manifestations of \noverdosage would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. If symptomatic \nhypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor, ATC code: C09XA02 \n \nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n \nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAS at the point of activation, blocking the \nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin \nII. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAS (ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)) \ncause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in \nhypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was \ncombined with other antihypertensive agents. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on \nPRA are not known at the present time. \n \nHypertension \nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Enviage at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \nethnicity. Enviage has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n75 years or older. \n \nEnviage monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes \nof antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB. Compared to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide - \nHCTZ), Enviage 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to \n14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. In diabetic hypertensive patients, \nEnviage monotherapy was safe and effective. \n \nCombination therapy studies are available for Enviage added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \nACEI ramipril, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan, \nand the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well tolerated. Enviage induced an additive \nblood-pressure-lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide and to ramipril. In patients who did \nnot adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the addition of Enviage \n150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to that obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to \n10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren 150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine \n10 mg 11.2%). Enviage in combination with the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan showed an \nadditive antihypertensive effect in the study specifically designed to investigate the effect of the \ncombination therapy. \n \nIn obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with \nEnviage 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on \ntreatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg. In diabetic hypertensive patients, Enviage \n\n7 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nprovided additive blood pressure reductions when added to ramipril, while the combination of Enviage \nand ramipril had a lower incidence of cough (1.8%) than ramipril (4.7%). \n \nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \nuncomplicated hypertension treated with Enviage alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. With cessation of treatment, blood \npressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence \nof a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n \nIn a 3-month study of 302 patients with mild stable heart failure, all of whom were receiving standard \ntherapy for stable heart failure, addition of Enviage 150 mg was well tolerated. B-type natriuretic \npeptide (BNP) levels were reduced by 25% in the Enviage arm compared to placebo. However the \nclinical significance of this reduction is unknown. \n \nIn a 6-month study of 599 patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nephropathy, all of \nwhom were receiving losartan 100 mg and optimised antihypertensive background therapy, addition of \nEnviage 300 mg achieved a 20% reduction versus placebo in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio \n(UACR), i.e. from 58 mg/mmol to 46 mg/mmol. The proportion of patients who had UACR reduced at \nleast 50% from baseline to endpoint was 24.7% and 12.5% for Enviage and placebo, respectively. The \nclinical relevance of a reduction in UACR is not established in the absence of an effect on blood \npressure. Enviage did not affect the serum concentration of creatinine but was associated with an \nincreased frequency (4.2% vs. 1.9% for placebo) of serum potassium concentration ≥6.0 mmol/l, \nalthough this was not statistically significant. \n \nBeneficial effects of Enviage on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are \ncurrently unknown. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \nby 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following \nonce-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial \ndose. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately \n135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. Aliskiren \nplasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n \nMetabolism and elimination \nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the mean plasma clearance is \napproximately 9 l/h. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\n8 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n \nCharacteristics in patients \nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n \nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \nadjustment of the initial dosage of Enviage is required in patients with mild to severe renal \nimpairment, however caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to \nsevere hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in \nrats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n \nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n \nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet \n \nLight-red, biconvex, ovaloid tablet, imprinted “IU” on one side and “NVR” on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe recommended dose of Enviage is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not \nadequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks (85-90%) after initiating therapy \nwith 150 mg once daily. \n \nEnviage may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1). \n \nEnviage should be taken with a light meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit \njuice should not be taken together with Enviage. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe renal impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nElderly patients (over 65 years) \nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric patients (below 18 years) \nEnviage is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of data on \nsafety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\n11 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nHistory of angioedema with aliskiren. \n \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin, a highly potent P-gp inhibitor, and other potent P-\ngp inhibitors (quinidine, verapamil), is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPatients receiving other medicinal products inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and/or \nthose with reduced kidney function and/or diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of hyperkalaemia \nduring aliskiren therapy. \n \nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \nHeart Association [NYHA] functional class III-IV). \n \nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Enviage therapy should be stopped. \n \nAngioedema \nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema has been reported in patients \ntreated with aliskiren. If angioedema occurs, Enviage should be promptly discontinued and appropriate \ntherapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has \noccurred. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to ensure patient airways should be provided. \n \nSodium and/or volume depleted patients \nIn patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. those receiving high doses of diuretics) \nsymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Enviage. This condition should \nbe corrected prior to administration of Enviage, or the treatment should start under close medical \nsupervision. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn clinical studies Enviage has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \nimpairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and ≥ 177 μmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \nmen and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min), history of dialysis, nephrotic \nsyndrome or renovascular hypertension. Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with \nsevere renal impairment due to the lack of safety information for Enviage. \n \nAs for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren \nis given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (eg. \ndue to blood loss, severe prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease or \nkidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in \nat-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal \nfailure occur, aliskiren should be promptly discontinued. \n \nRenal artery stenosis \nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Enviage in patients with unilateral or bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on the \nrenin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, \nwhen patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore, caution should be \nexercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n \nModerate P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg resulted in a 76% increase in \naliskiren AUC but P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole are expected to increase tissue concentrations  \n\n12 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nmore than plasma concentrations. Therefore caution should be exercised when aliskiren is \nadministered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEnviage has no known clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products commonly used to treat \nhypertension or diabetes. \n \nCompounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol, \natenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, ramipril and \nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n \nCo-administration of aliskiren with either valsartan (↓28%), metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or \ncimetidine (↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Enviage. When \nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state Enviage AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\nadministration of Enviage had no significant impact on atorvastatin, valsartan, metformin or \namlodipine pharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for Enviage or these co-administered \nmedicinal products is necessary. \n \nDigoxin bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Enviage. \n \nPreliminary data suggest that irbesartan may decrease Enviage AUC and Cmax. \n \nIn experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Enviage \nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \nbioavailability of Enviage. \n \nCYP450 interactions \nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic exposure \nof substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is metabolised \nminimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or induction of \nCYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-gp. Increased \naliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp can therefore \nbe expected (see P-glycoprotein interactions below). \n \nP-glycoprotein interactions \nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) \nmight therefore decrease the bioavailability of Enviage. Although this has not been investigated for \naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors \ncan increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue \nlevels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will likely depend \non the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n \nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n50%. \n \nModerate P-gp inhibitors \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted in an 80% increase in \nplasma levels of aliskiren (AUC and Cmax). Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole \nco-administration enhances aliskiren gastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. The \nchange in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole is expected to be within the range \nthat would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice \nthe highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical \n\n13 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\ntrials. Yet, P-gp inhibitors are expected to increase tissue concentrations more than plasma \nconcentrations. Therefore, caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with \nketoconazole or other moderate pgp inhibitors (itraconazol, clarithromycin, telithromycin, \nerythromycin, amiodarone). \n \nP-gp potent inhibitors \nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. Therefore, concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent \ninhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nFurosemide \nWhen aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced \nby 28% and 49% respectively. It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when \ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible under-utilisation in clinical situations of \nvolume overload. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-\nhypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated \npatients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further \ndeterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. \nTherefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n \nPotassium and potassium-sparing diuretics \nBased on experience with the use of other substances that affect the renin-angiotensin system, \nconcomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \npotassium or other substances that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to \nincreases in serum potassium. If co-medication is considered necessary, caution is advisable. \n \nGrapefruit juice \nDue to the lack of data a potential interaction between grapefruit juice and aliskiren cannot be \nexcluded. Grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Enviage. \n \nWarfarin \nThe effects of Enviage on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n \nFood intake \nMeals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of Enviage substantially. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Enviage was not teratogenic in rats or \nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAS have been associated with \nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAS, \nEnviage should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become \npregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). Healthcare \nprofessionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAS should counsel women of childbearing \npotential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during \ntherapy, Enviage should be discontinued accordingly. \n \nLactation \nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Enviage was secreted in the milk of \nlactating rats. Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding. \n\n14 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \nwhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness \nmay occasionally occur when taking any antihypertensive therapy. Enviage has negligible influence \non the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nEnviage has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for \nover 6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse reactions showed no \nassociation with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with Enviage resulted in \nan overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo up to 300 mg. Adverse reactions have \ngenerally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of \ntherapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is diarrhoea. \n \nThe incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.6%) and Enviage treated (0.9%) patients. \n \nThe adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, \nusing the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000, <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), including isolated reports. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1 \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n Common: Diarrhoea \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Uncommon: Rash \n Rare: Angioedema \n\n \nAngioedema has occurred during treatment with Enviage. In controlled clinical trials, angioedema \noccurred rarely during treatment with Enviage with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or \nhydrochlorothiazide. Cases of angioedema have also been reported in post-marketing experience \n(frequency unknown). In the event of any signs suggesting an allergic reaction (in particular \ndifficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or tongue) \npatients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n \nLaboratory findings \nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \nuncommonly associated with the administration of Enviage. In clinical studies in hypertensive \npatients, Enviage had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n \nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\nangiotensin system, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor \nblockers. \n \nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium were minor and infrequent in patients with essential \nhypertension treated with Enviage alone (0.9% compared to 0.6% with placebo). However, in one \nstudy where Enviage was used in combination with an ACEI in a diabetic population, increases in \nserum potassium were more frequent (5.5%). Therefore as with any agent acting on the RAS system, \nroutine monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is indicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, \nkidney disease, or heart failure. \n\n15 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited data are available related to overdose in humans. The most likely manifestations of \noverdosage would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. If symptomatic \nhypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor, ATC code: C09XA02 \n \nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n \nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAS at the point of activation, blocking the \nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin \nII. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAS (ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)) \ncause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in \nhypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was \ncombined with other antihypertensive agents. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on \nPRA are not known at the present time. \n \nHypertension \nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Enviage at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \nethnicity. Enviage has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n75 years or older. \n \nEnviage monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes \nof antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB. Compared to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide - \nHCTZ), Enviage 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to \n14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. In diabetic hypertensive patients, \nEnviage monotherapy was safe and effective. \n \nCombination therapy studies are available for Enviage added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \nACEI ramipril, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan, \nand the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well tolerated. Enviage induced an additive \nblood-pressure-lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide and to ramipril. In patients who did \nnot adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the addition of Enviage \n150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to that obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to \n10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren 150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine \n10 mg 11.2%). Enviage in combination with the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan showed an \nadditive antihypertensive effect in the study specifically designed to investigate the effect of the \ncombination therapy. \n \nIn obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with \nEnviage 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on \ntreatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg. In diabetic hypertensive patients, Enviage \n\n16 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nprovided additive blood pressure reductions when added to ramipril, while the combination of Enviage \nand ramipril had a lower incidence of cough (1.8%) than ramipril (4.7%). \n \nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \nuncomplicated hypertension treated with Enviage alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. With cessation of treatment, blood \npressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence \nof a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n \nIn a 3-month study of 302 patients with mild stable heart failure, all of whom were receiving standard \ntherapy for stable heart failure, addition of Enviage 150 mg was well tolerated. B-type natriuretic \npeptide (BNP) levels were reduced by 25% in the Enviage arm compared to placebo. However the \nclinical significance of this reduction is unknown. \n \nIn a 6-month study of 599 patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nephropathy, all of \nwhom were receiving losartan 100 mg and optimised antihypertensive background therapy, addition of \nEnviage 300 mg achieved a 20% reduction versus placebo in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio \n(UACR), i.e. from 58 mg/mmol to 46 mg/mmol. The proportion of patients who had UACR reduced at \nleast 50% from baseline to endpoint was 24.7% and 12.5% for Enviage and placebo, respectively. The \nclinical relevance of a reduction in UACR is not established in the absence of an effect on blood \npressure. Enviage did not affect the serum concentration of creatinine but was associated with an \nincreased frequency (4.2% vs. 1.9% for placebo) of serum potassium concentration ≥6.0 mmol/l, \nalthough this was not statistically significant. \n \nBeneficial effects of Enviage on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are \ncurrently unknown. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \nby 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following \nonce-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial \ndose. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately \n135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. Aliskiren \nplasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n \nMetabolism and elimination \nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the mean plasma clearance is \napproximately 9 l/h. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\n17 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n \nCharacteristics in patients \nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n \nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \nadjustment of the initial dosage of Enviage is required in patients with mild to severe renal \nimpairment, however caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to \nsevere hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in \nrats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n \nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n \nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n \n \n6.

WHAT ENVIAGE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nEnviage belongs to a new class of medicines called renin inhibitors. Enviage helps to lower high blood \npressure. Renin inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can produce. Angiotensin II \ncauses blood vessels to tighten, which increases the blood pressure. Reducing the amount of \nangiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax, which lowers blood pressure. \n \nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \nof developing these disorders. \n \n \n2.
