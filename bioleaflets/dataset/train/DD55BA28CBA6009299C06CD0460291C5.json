This will allow quick identification \nof new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse \nreactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZessly 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 100 mg of infliximab. Infliximab is a chimeric human-murine IgG1 monoclonal \nantibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. After \nreconstitution each ml contains 10 mg of infliximab. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). \n \nThe powder is a freeze-dried white pellet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nZessly, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the reduction of signs and symptoms as \nwell as the improvement in physical function in: \n\u2022 adult patients with active disease when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic \n\ndrugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate, has been inadequate. \n\u2022 adult patients with severe, active and progressive disease not previously treated with \n\nmethotrexate or other DMARDs. \nIn these patient populations, a reduction in the rate of the progression of joint damage, as measured \nby X-ray, has been demonstrated (see section 5.1). \n \nAdult Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nZessly is indicated for: \n\u2022 treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, in adult patients who have not \n\nresponded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \ntherapies. \n\n\u2022 treatment of fistulising, active Crohn\u2019s disease, in adult patients who have not responded \ndespite a full and adequate course of therapy with conventional treatment (including \nantibiotics, drainage and immunosuppressive therapy). \n\n \nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nZessly is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn\u2019s disease, in children and adolescents aged \n6 to 17 years, who have not responded to conventional therapy including a corticosteroid, an \nimmunomodulator and primary nutrition therapy; or who are intolerant to or have contraindications \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nfor such therapies. Infliximab has been studied only in combination with conventional \nimmunosuppressive therapy. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nZessly is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients \nwho have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-\nmercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical \ncontraindications for such therapies. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nZessly is indicated for treatment of severely active ulcerative colitis, in children and adolescents \naged 6 to 17 years, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \ncorticosteroids and 6-MP or AZA, or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for \nsuch therapies. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis \n \nZessly is indicated for treatment of severe, active ankylosing spondylitis, in adult patients who have \nresponded inadequately to conventional therapy. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nZessly is indicated for treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when \nthe response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. \nZessly should be administered \n\u2022 in combination with methotrexate \n\u2022 or alone in patients who show intolerance to methotrexate or for whom methotrexate is \n\ncontraindicated \nInfliximab has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to \nreduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with \npolyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1). \n \nPsoriasis \n \nZessly is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who failed \nto respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy \nincluding cyclosporine, methotrexate or PUVA (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nZessly treatment is to be initiated and supervised by qualified physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, ankylosing \nspondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. Zessly should be administered intravenously. Zessly \ninfusions should be administered by qualified healthcare professionals trained to detect any \ninfusion-related issues. Patients treated with Zessly should be given the package leaflet and the \npatient reminder card. \n \nDuring Zessly treatment, other concomitant therapies, e.g. corticosteroids and immunosuppressants \nshould be optimised. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nPosology \n \nAdults (\u2265 18 years) \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \n3 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 3 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter.  \n \nZessly must be given concomitantly with methotrexate. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nIf a patient has an inadequate response or loses response after this period, consideration may be \ngiven to increase the dose step-wise by approximately 1.5 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 7.5 mg/kg \nevery 8 weeks. Alternatively, administration of 3 mg/kg as often as every 4 weeks may be \nconsidered. If adequate response is achieved, patients should be continued on the selected dose or \ndose frequency. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no \nevidence of therapeutic benefit within the first 12 weeks of treatment or after dose adjustment.  \n \nModerately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease \n \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by an additional 5 mg/kg infusion 2 weeks after \nthe first infusion. If a patient does not respond after 2 doses, no additional treatment with infliximab \nshould be given. Available data do not support further infliximab treatment, in patients not \nresponding within 6 weeks of the initial infusion. \n \nIn responding patients, the alternative strategies for continued treatment are: \n\u2022 Maintenance: Additional infusion of 5 mg/kg at 6 weeks after the initial dose, followed by \n\ninfusions every 8 weeks or \n\u2022 Re-administration: Infusion of 5 mg/kg if signs and symptoms of the disease recur (see \u2018Re-\n\nadministration\u2019 below and section 4.4). \n \nAlthough comparative data are lacking, limited data in patients who initially responded to 5 mg/kg \nbut who lost response indicate that some patients may regain response with dose escalation (see \nsection 5.1). Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence \nof therapeutic benefit after dose adjustment. \n \nFistulising, active Crohn\u2019s disease \n \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusions at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion. If a patient does not respond after 3 doses, no additional treatment \nwith infliximab should be given. \n \nIn responding patients, the alternative strategies for continued treatment are: \n\u2022 Maintenance: Additional infusions of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks or \n\u2022 Re-administration: Infusion of 5 mg/kg if signs and symptoms of the disease recur followed \n\nby infusions of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks (see \u2018Re-administration\u2019 below and section 4.4). \n \nAlthough comparative data are lacking, limited data in patients who initially responded to 5 mg/kg \nbut who lost response indicate that some patients may regain response with dose escalation (see \nsection 5.1). Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence \nof therapeutic benefit after dose adjustment. \n \nIn Crohn\u2019s disease, experience with re-administration if signs and symptoms of disease recur is \nlimited and comparative data on the benefit/risk of the alternative strategies for continued treatment \nare lacking. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nUlcerative colitis \n \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 14 weeks of treatment, \ni.e. three doses. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no \nevidence of therapeutic benefit within this time period. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis \n \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 6 to 8 weeks. If a patient does not respond by 6 weeks \n(i.e. after 2 doses), no additional treatment with infliximab should be given. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter.  \n \nPsoriasis \n \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. If a patient shows no response after \n14 weeks (i.e. after 4 doses), no additional treatment with infliximab should be given. \n \nRe-administration for Crohn\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis \n \nIf the signs and symptoms of disease recur, Zessly can be re-administered within 16 weeks \nfollowing the last infusion. In clinical studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been \nuncommon and have occurred after infliximab-free intervals of less than 1 year (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.8). The safety and efficacy of re-administration after an infliximab-free interval of more than \n16 weeks has not been established. This applies to both Crohn\u2019s disease patients and rheumatoid \narthritis patients. \n \nRe-administration for ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 8 weeks, has not been established \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRe-administration for ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 6 to 8 weeks, has not been established \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRe-administration for psoriatic arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 8 weeks, has not been established \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRe-administration for psoriasis \n \nLimited experience from re-treatment with one single infliximab dose in psoriasis after an interval \nof 20 weeks suggests reduced efficacy and a higher incidence of mild to moderate infusion \nreactions when compared to the initial induction regimen (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nLimited experience from re-treatment following disease flare by a re-induction regimen suggests a \nhigher incidence of infusion reactions, including serious ones, when compared to 8-weekly \nmaintenance treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nRe-administration across indications \n \nIn case maintenance therapy is interrupted, and there is a need to restart treatment, use of a re-\ninduction regimen is not recommended (see section 4.8). In this situation, Zessly should be re-\ninitiated as a single dose followed by the maintenance dose recommendations described above. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nSpecific studies of infliximab in elderly patients have not been conducted. No major age-related \ndifferences in clearance or volume of distribution were observed in clinical studies. No dose \nadjustment is required (see section 5.2). For more information about the safety of infliximab in \nelderly patients see sections 4.4 and 4.8. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \nInfliximab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease (6 to 17 years) \n \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. Available data do not support further \ninfliximab treatment in children and adolescents not responding within the first 10 weeks of \ntreatment (see section 5.1). \n \nSome patients may require a shorter dosing interval to maintain clinical benefit, while for others a \nlonger dosing interval may be sufficient. Patients who have had their dose interval shortened to less \nthan 8 weeks may be at greater risk for adverse reactions. Continued therapy with a shortened \ninterval should be carefully considered in those patients who show no evidence of additional \ntherapeutic benefit after a change in dosing interval. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab have not been studied in children with Crohn\u2019s disease below \nthe age of 6 years. Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made in children younger than 6 years. \n \nUlcerative colitis (6 to 17 years) \n \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. Available data do not support further \ninfliximab treatment in paediatric patients not responding within the first 8 weeks of treatment \n(see section 5.1). \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab have not been studied in children with ulcerative colitis below \nthe age of 6 years. Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made in children younger than 6 years. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the \nindication of psoriasis have not been established. Currently available data are described in section \n5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the \nindications of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis have not \nbeen established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the \nindication of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have not been established. Currently available data are \ndescribed in sections 4.8 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nZessly should be administered intravenously over a 2 hour period. All patients administered Zessly \nare to be observed for at least 1-2 hours post-infusion for acute infusion-related reactions. \nEmergency equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and an artificial airway \nmust be available. Patients may be pre-treated with e.g., an antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or \nparacetamol and infusion rate may be slowed in order to decrease the risk of infusion-related \nreactions especially if infusion-related reactions have occurred previously (see section 4.4). \n \nShortened infusions across adult indications \n \nIn carefully selected adult patients who have tolerated at least 3 initial 2-hour infusions of Zessly \n(induction phase) and are receiving maintenance therapy, consideration may be given to \nadministering subsequent infusions over a period of not less than 1 hour. If an infusion reaction \noccurs in association with a shortened infusion, a slower infusion rate may be considered for future \ninfusions if treatment is to be continued. Shortened infusions at doses > 6 mg/kg have not been \nstudied (see section 4.8).  \n \nFor preparation and administration instructions, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed \nin section 6.1. \n \nPatients with tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, abscesses, and opportunistic \ninfections (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n \nInfusion reactions and hypersensitivity \n \nInfliximab has been associated with acute infusion-related reactions, including anaphylactic shock, \nand delayed hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). \nAcute infusion reactions including anaphylactic reactions may develop during (within seconds) or \nwithin a few hours following infusion. If acute infusion reactions occur, the infusion must be \ninterrupted immediately. Emergency equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nand an artificial airway must be available. Patients may be pre-treated with e.g., an antihistamine, \nhydrocortisone and/or paracetamol to prevent mild and transient effects. \nAntibodies to infliximab may develop and have been associated with an increased frequency of \ninfusion reactions. A low proportion of the infusion reactions was serious allergic reactions. An \nassociation between development of antibodies to infliximab and reduced duration of response has \nalso been observed. Concomitant administration of immunomodulators has been associated with \nlower incidence of antibodies to infliximab and a reduction in the frequency of infusion reactions. \nThe effect of concomitant immunomodulator therapy was more profound in episodically-treated \npatients than in patients given maintenance therapy. Patients who discontinue immunosuppressants \nprior to or during infliximab treatment are at greater risk of developing these antibodies. Antibodies \nto infliximab cannot always be detected in serum samples. If serious reactions occur, symptomatic \ntreatment must be given and further Zessly infusions must not be administered (see section 4.8). \n \nIn clinical studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Available data suggest an \nincreased risk for delayed hypersensitivity with increasing infliximab-free interval. Patients should \nbe advised to seek immediate medical advice if they experience any delayed adverse reaction (see \nsection 4.8). If patients are re-treated after a prolonged period, they must be closely monitored for \nsigns and symptoms of delayed hypersensitivity. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients must be monitored closely for infections including tuberculosis before, during and after \ntreatment with Zessly. Because the elimination of infliximab may take up to six months, monitoring \nshould be continued throughout this period. Further treatment with Zessly must not be given if a \npatient develops a serious infection or sepsis. \n \nCaution should be exercised when considering the use of Zessly in patients with chronic infection \nor a history of recurrent infections, including concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Patients \nshould be advised of and avoid exposure to potential risk factors for infection as appropriate. \n \nTumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune \nresponses. Experimental data show that TNF\u03b1 is essential for the clearing of intracellular infections. \n \nClinical experience shows that host defence against infection is compromised in some patients \ntreated with infliximab. \n \nIt should be noted that suppression of TNF\u03b1 may mask symptoms of infection such as fever. Early \nrecognition of atypical clinical presentations of serious infections and of typical clinical \npresentation of rare and unusual infections is critical in order to minimise delays in diagnosis and \ntreatment. \n \nPatients taking TNF-blockers are more susceptible to serious infections. \nTuberculosis, bacterial infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, invasive fungal, viral, and other \nopportunistic infections have been observed in patients treated with infliximab. Some of these \ninfections have been fatal; the most frequently reported opportunistic infections with a mortality \nrate of > 5% include pneumocystosis, candidiasis, listeriosis and aspergillosis. \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Zessly, should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Zessly should be \ndiscontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or \nantifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. \n \nTuberculosis \nThere have been reports of active tuberculosis in patients receiving infliximab. It should be noted \nthat in the majority of these reports tuberculosis was extrapulmonary, presenting as either local or \ndisseminated disease. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nBefore starting treatment with Zessly, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal \nhistory of tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, (e.g. tuberculin skin test, chest X-ray, \nand/or Interferon Gamma Release Assay), should be performed in all patients (local \nrecommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded \nin the patient\u2019s reminder card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin \ntest results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Zessly therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should \nbe consulted. In all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of Zessly therapy should be \nvery carefully considered. \n \nIf inactive (\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with \nantituberculosis therapy before the initiation of Zessly, and in accordance with local \nrecommendations. \n \nIn patients who have several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis and have a negative test for \nlatent tuberculosis, antituberculosis therapy should be considered before the initiation of Zessly. \n \nUse of antituberculosis therapy should also be considered before the initiation of Zessly in patients \nwith a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot \nbe confirmed. \nSome cases of active tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with infliximab during and \nafter treatment for latent tuberculosis. \nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of \ntuberculosis (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after \nZessly treatment. \n \nInvasive fungal infections \nIn patients treated with Zessly, an invasive fungal infection such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, \npneumocystosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis should be suspected if they \ndevelop a serious systemic illness, and a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of \ninvasive fungal infections should be consulted at an early stage when investigating these patients. \nInvasive fungal infections may present as disseminated rather than localised disease, and antigen \nand antibody testing may be negative in some patients with active infection. Appropriate empiric \nantifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed taking into \naccount both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy. \n \nFor patients who have resided in or travelled to regions where invasive fungal infections such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are endemic, the benefits and risks of Zessly \ntreatment should be carefully considered before initiation of Zessly therapy. \n \nFistulising Crohn\u2019s disease \nPatients with fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease with acute suppurative fistulas must not initiate Zessly \ntherapy until a source for possible infection, specifically abscess, has been excluded (see section \n4.3). \n \nHepatitis B (HBV) reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including \ninfliximab, who are chronic carriers of this virus. Some cases have had fatal outcome. \n \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Zessly. For patients \nwho test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nhepatitis B is recommended. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Zessly should be closely \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several \nmonths following termination of therapy. Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of \nHBV with antiviral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV \nreactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, Zessly should be stopped \nand effective antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nHepatobiliary events \n \nCases of jaundice and non-infectious hepatitis, some with features of autoimmune hepatitis, have \nbeen observed in the post-marketing experience of infliximab. Isolated cases of liver failure \nresulting in liver transplantation or death have occurred. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver \ndysfunction should be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or ALT elevations \u2265 5 \ntimes the upper limit of normal develop(s), Zessly should be discontinued, and a thorough \ninvestigation of the abnormality should be undertaken. \n \nConcurrent administration of TNF-alpha inhibitor and anakinra \n \nSerious infections and neutropenia were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and \nanother TNF\u03b1-blocking agent, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept \nalone. Because of the nature of the adverse reactions seen with combination of etanercept and \nanakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other \nTNF\u03b1-blocking agents. Therefore, the combination of Zessly and anakinra is not recommended. \n \nConcurrent administration of TNF-alpha inhibitor and abatacept \n \nIn clinical studies concurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and abatacept has been associated \nwith an increased risk of infections including serious infections compared to TNF-antagonists \nalone, without increased clinical benefit. The combination of Zessly and abatacept is not \nrecommended. \n \nConcurrent administration with other biological therapeutics \n \nThere is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of infliximab with other biological \ntherapeutics used to treat the same conditions as infliximab. The concomitant use of infliximab with \nthese biologics is not recommended because of the possibility of an increased risk of infection, and \nother potential pharmacological interactions. \n \nSwitching between biological DMARDs \n \nCare should be taken and patients should continue to be monitored when switching from one \nbiologic to another, since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk for adverse \nreactions, including infection. \n \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all vaccinations in \nagreement with current vaccination guidelines prior to initiating infliximab therapy. Patients on \ninfliximab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). \n \nIn a subset of 90 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the study 2 a similar proportion of \npatients in each treatment group (methotrexateplus: placebo [n=17], 3mg/kg [n=27] or 6mg/kg \ninfliximab [n=46]) mounted an effective two-fold increase in titers to a polyvalent pneumococcal \nvaccine, indicating that infliximab did not interfere with T-cell independent humoral immune \nresponses. However,studies from the published literature in variousindications (e.g. rheumatoid \narthritis, psoriasis, Crohn\u2019s disease) suggestthat non-live vaccinations received during treatment \nwith anti-TNF therapies, including infliximab, may elicit a lower immune response than in patients \nnot receiving anti-TNF therapy.\" \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nLive vaccines/therapeutic infectious agents \n \nIn patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, limited data are available on the response to vaccination \nwith live vaccines or on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines. Use of live \nvaccines can result in clinical infections, including disseminated infections. The concurrent \nadministration of live vaccines with Zessly is not recommended. \n \nIn infants exposed in utero to infliximab, fatal outcome due to disseminated Bacillus Calmette-\nGu\u00e9rin (BCG) infection has been reported following administration of BCG vaccine after birth. At \nleast a six month waiting period following birth is recommended before the administration of live \nvaccines to infants exposed in utero to infliximab (see section 4.6). \n \nOther uses of therapeutic infectious agents such as live attenuated bacteria (e.g., BCG bladder \ninstillation for the treatment of cancer) could result in clinical infections, including disseminated \ninfections. It is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with \nZessly. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nThe relative deficiency of TNF\u03b1 caused by anti-TNF therapy may result in the initiation of an \nautoimmune process. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following \ntreatment with Zessly and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment \nwith Zessly must not be given (see section 4.8). \n \nNeurological events \n \nUse of TNF-blocking agents, including infliximab, has been associated with cases of new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis, and peripheral demyelinating disorders, \nincluding Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating \ndisorders, the benefits and risks of anti-TNF treatment should be carefully considered before \ninitiation of Zessly therapy. Discontinuation of Zessly should be considered if these disorders \ndevelop. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical studies of TNF-blocking agents, more cases of malignancies \nincluding lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF blocker compared with \ncontrol patients. During clinical studies of infliximab across all approved indications the incidence \nof lymphoma in infliximab-treated patients was higher than expected in the general population, but \nthe occurrence of lymphoma was rare. In the post-marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation. \n \nIn an exploratory clinical study evaluating the use of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies were reported in infliximab-\ntreated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking. \nCaution should be exercised in considering treatment of patients with increased risk for malignancy \ndue to heavy smoking. \n \nWith the current knowledge, a risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in \npatients treated with a TNF-blocking agent cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). Caution should be \nexercised when considering TNF-blocking therapy for patients with a history of malignancy or \nwhen considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nCaution should also be exercised in patients with psoriasis and a medical history of extensive \nimmunosuppressant therapy or prolonged PUVA treatment. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), \nincluding infliximab in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. \nThe other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies \nusually associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in patients \ntreated with TNF-blockers cannot be excluded. \n \nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients \ntreated with TNF-blocking agents including infliximab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a \nvery aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with \nAZA or 6-MP concomitantly with or immediately prior to a TNF-blocker. The vast majority of \ninfliximab cases have occurred in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were \nreported in adolescent or young adult males. The potential risk with the combination of AZA or 6-\nMP and Zessly should be carefully considered. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell \nlymphoma in patients treated with infliximab cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nMelanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF blocker \ntherapy, including infliximab (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended, \nparticularly for patients with risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nA population-based retrospective cohort study using data from Swedish national health registries \nfound an increased incidence of cervical cancer in women with rheumatoid arthritis treated with \ninfliximab compared to biologics-na\u00efve patients or the general population, including those over 60 \nyears of age. Periodic screening should continue in women treated with Zessly, including those \nover 60 years of age. \n \nAll patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma (for \nexample, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who \nhad a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular \nintervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include \ncolonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations. Current data do not indicate that infliximab \ntreatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or colon cancer . \n \nSince the possibility of increased risk of cancer development in patients with newly diagnosed \ndysplasia treated with infliximab is not established, the risk and benefits of continued therapy to the \nindividual patients should be carefully considered by the clinician. \n \nHeart failure \n \nZessly should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Patients \nshould be closely monitored and Zessly must not be continued in patients who develop new or \nworsening symptoms of heart failure (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nThere have been reports of pancytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia in \npatients receiving TNF-blockers, including infliximab. All patients should be advised to seek \nimmediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor). Discontinuation of Zessly therapy should be \nconsidered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nOthers \n \nThere is limited safety experience of infliximab treatment in patients who have undergone surgical \nprocedures, including arthroplasty. The long half-life of infliximab should be taken into \nconsideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on Zessly \nshould be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should be taken. \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of a fixed fibrotic \nstricture that may require surgical treatment. There is no evidence to suggest that infliximab \nworsens or causes fibrotic strictures. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nThe incidence of serious infections in infliximab-treated patients 65 years and older was greater \nthan in those under 65 years of age. Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly (see section 4.8). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInfections \n \nIn clinical studies, infections have been reported in a higher proportion of paediatric patients \ncompared to adult patients (see section 4.8). \n \nVaccinations \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all vaccinations in \nagreement with current vaccination guidelines prior to initiating Zessly therapy. Paediatric patients \non infliximab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines (see sections 4.5 and \n4.6).  \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), \nincluding infliximab in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. \nThe other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies \nusually associated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children \nand adolescents treated with TNF-blockers cannot be excluded. \n \nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nTNF-blocking agents including infliximab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive \ndisease course and is usually fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with AZA or 6-MP \nconcomitantly with or immediately prior to a TNF-blocker. The vast majority of infliximab cases \nhave occurred in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were reported in \nadolescent or young adult males. The potential risk with the combination of AZA or 6-MP and \nZessly should be carefully considered. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell \nlymphoma in patients treated with infliximab cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nSodium Content \n \nZessly contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \nZessly is however, diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. This should be \ntaken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet (see section 6.6). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease patients, there are indications that \nconcomitant use of methotrexate and other immunomodulators reduces the formation of antibodies \nagainst infliximab and increases the plasma concentrations of infliximab. However, the results are \nuncertain due to limitations in the methods used for serum analyses of infliximab and antibodies \nagainst infliximab. \n \nCorticosteroids do not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of infliximab to a clinically relevant \nextent. \n \nThe combination of Zessly with other biological therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as \nZessly, including anakinra and abatacept, is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nIt is recommended that live vaccines not be given concurrently with Zessly. It is also recommended \nthat live vaccines not be given to infants after in utero exposure to infliximab for at least 6 months \nfollowing birth (see section 4.4). \n \nIt is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with Zessly (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least 6 months after the last Zessly treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe moderate number of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to infliximab resulting in live \nbirth with known outcomes, including approximately 1,100 exposed during the first trimester, does \nnot indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nBased on an observational study from Northern Europe, an increased risk (OR, 95% CI; p-value) \nfor C-section section (1.50, 1.14-1.96; p = 0.0032), preterm birth (1.48, 1.05-2.09; p = 0.024), small \nfor gestational age (2.79, 1.54-5.04; p = 0.0007), and low birth weight (2.03, 1.41-2.94; p = 0.0002)  \nwas observed in women exposed during pregnancy to infliximab (with or without \nimmunomodulators/corticosteroids, 270 pregnancies) as compared to women exposed to \nimmunomodulators and/or corticosteroids only (6,460 pregnancies). The potential contribution of \nexposure to infliximab and/or the severity of the underlying disease in these outcomes remains \nunclear.  \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, infliximab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn. In a developmental toxicity study conducted in mice using an \nanalogous antibody that selectively inhibits the functional activity of mouse TNF\u03b1, there was no \nindication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThe available clinical experience is limited. Infliximab should only be used during pregnancy if \nclearly needed. \n \nInfliximab crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants up to 6 months \nfollowing birth. After in utero exposure to infliximab, infants may be at increased risk of infection, \nincluding serious disseminated infection that can become fatal. Administration of live vaccines (e.g. \nBCG vaccine) to infants exposed to infliximab in utero is not recommended for at least 6 months \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nafter birth (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Cases of agranulocytosis have also been reported (see section \n4.8). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether infliximab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after \ningestion. Because human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast feed for \nat least 6 months after Zessly treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are insufficient preclinical data to draw conclusions on the effects of infliximab on fertility \nand general reproductive function (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZessly may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur \nfollowing administration of infliximab (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nUpper respiratory tract infection was the most common adverse drug reaction (ADR) reported in \nclinical trials, occurring in 25.3% of infliximab-treated patients compared with 16.5% of control \npatients. The most serious ADRs associated with the use of TNF blockers that have been reported \nfor infliximab include HBV reactivation, CHF (congestive heart failure), serious infections \n(including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity \nreactions), haematologic reactions, systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus-like syndrome, \ndemyelinating disorders, hepatobiliary events, lymphoma, HSTCL, leukaemia, Merkel cell \ncarcinoma, melanoma, paediatric malignancy, sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reaction, intestinal or \nperianal abscess (in Crohn\u2019s disease), and serious infusion reactions (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1 lists ADRs based on experience from clinical studies as well as adverse reactions, some \nwith fatal outcome, reported from post-marketing experience. Within the organ system classes, \nadverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nTable 1 \nUndesirable effects in clinical studies and from post-marketing experience \n\nInfections and infestations

bovine tuberculosis (disseminated BCG infection), see section 4.4 \n \nInfusion-related reactions \n \nAn infusion-related reaction was defined in clinical studies as any adverse event occurring during \nan infusion or within 1 hour after an infusion. In Phase III clinical studies, 18% of infliximab-\ntreated patients compared with 5% of placebo-treated patients experienced an infusion-related \nreaction. Overall, a higher proportion of patients receiving infliximab monotherapy experienced an \ninfusion-related reaction compared to patients receiving infliximab with concomitant \nimmunomodulators. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued treatment due to infusion-related \nreactions and all patients recovered with or without medical therapy. Of infliximab-treated patients \nwho had an infusion reaction during the induction period, through week 6, 27% experienced an \ninfusion reaction during the maintenance period, week 7 through week 54. Of patients who did not \nhave an infusion reaction during the induction period, 9% experienced an infusion reaction during \nthe maintenance period. \n \nIn a clinical study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, infusions were to be administered over \n2 hours for the first 3 infusions. The duration of subsequent infusions could be shortened to not less \nthan 40 minutes in patients who did not experience serious infusion reactions. In this trial, sixty six \npercent of the patients (686 out of 1,040) received at least one shortened infusion of 90 minutes or \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nless and 44% of the patients (454 out of 1,040) received at least one shortened infusion of 60 \nminutes or less. Of the infliximab-treated patients who received at least one shortened infusion, \ninfusion-related reactions occurred in 15% of patients and serious infusion reactions occurred in \n0.4% of patients. \n \nIn a clinical study of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, infusion-related reactions occurred in 16.6% \n(27/163) of patients receiving infliximab monotherapy, 5% (9/179) of patients receiving infliximab \nin combination with AZA, and 5.6% (9/161) of patients receiving AZA monotherapy. One serious \ninfusion reaction (< 1%) occurred in a patient on infliximab monotherapy. \n \nIn post-marketing experience, cases of anaphylactic-like reactions, including laryngeal/pharyngeal \noedema and severe bronchospasm, and seizure have been associated with infliximab administration \n(see section 4.4). Cases of transient visual loss occurring during or within 2 hours of infliximab \ninfusion have been reported. Events (some fatal) of myocardial ischaemia/infarction and arrhythmia \nhave also been reported, some in close temporal association with infusion of infliximab. \n \nInfusion reactions following re-administration of infliximab \n \nA clinical study in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis was designed to assess the efficacy \nand safety of long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of \ninfliximab (maximum of four infusions at 0, 2, 6, and 14 weeks) following disease flare. Patients \ndid not receive any concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. In the re-treatment arm, 4% (8/219) \nof patients experienced a serious infusion reaction versus < 1% (1/222) on maintenance therapy. \nThe majority of serious infusion reactions occurred during the second infusion at week 2. The \ninterval between the last maintenance dose and the first re-induction dose ranged from 35-231 days. \nSymptoms included, but were not limited to, dyspnoea, urticaria, facial oedema, and hypotension. \nIn all cases, infliximab treatment was discontinued and/or other treatment instituted with complete \nresolution of signs and symptoms. \n \nDelayed hypersensitivity \n \nIn clinical studies delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon and have occurred after \ninfliximab-free intervals of less than 1 year. In the psoriasis studies, delayed hypersensitivity \nreactions occurred early in the treatment course. Signs and symptoms included myalgia and/or \narthralgia with fever and/or rash, with some patients experiencing pruritus, facial, hand or lip \noedema, dysphagia, urticaria, sore throat and headache. \n \nThere are insufficient data on the incidence of delayed hypersensitivity reactions after infliximab-\nfree intervals of more than 1 year but limited data from clinical studies suggest an increased risk for \ndelayed hypersensitivity with increasing infliximab-free interval (see section 4.4). \n \nIn a 1-year clinical study with repeated infusions in patients with Crohn's disease, the incidence of \nserum sickness-like reactions was 2.4%. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nPatients who developed antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately 2-3 fold) to \ndevelop infusion-related reactions. Use of concomitant immunosuppressant agents appeared to \nreduce the frequency of infusion-related reactions. \nIn clinical studies using single and multiple infliximab doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg, \nantibodies to infliximab were detected in 14% of patients with any immunosuppressant therapy, and \nin 24% of patients without immunosuppressant therapy. In rheumatoid arthritis patients who \nreceived the recommended repeated treatment dose regimens with methotrexate, 8% of patients \ndeveloped antibodies to infliximab. In psoriatic arthritis patients who received 5 mg/kg with and \nwithout methotrexate, antibodies occurred overall in 15% of patients (antibodies occurred in 4% of \npatients receiving methotrexate and in 26% of patients not receiving methotrexate at baseline). In \nCrohn's disease patients who received maintenance treatment, antibodies to infliximab occurred \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\noverall in 3.3% of patients receiving immunosuppressants and in 13.3% of patients not receiving \nimmunosuppressants. The antibody incidence was 2-3 fold higher for patients treated episodically. \nDue to methodological limitations, a negative assay did not exclude the presence of antibodies to \ninfliximab. Some patients who developed high titres of antibodies to infliximab had evidence of \nreduced efficacy. In psoriasis patients treated with infliximab as a maintenance regimen in the \nabsence of concomitant immunomodulators, approximately 28% developed antibodies to infliximab \n(see section 4.4: \u201cInfusion reactions and hypersensitivity\u201d). \n \nInfections \n \nTuberculosis, bacterial infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, invasive fungal, viral, and other \nopportunistic infections have been observed in patients receiving infliximab. Some of these \ninfections have been fatal; the most frequently reported opportunistic infections with a mortality \nrate of > 5% include pneumocystosis, candidiasis, listeriosis and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). \n \nIn clinical studies 36% of infliximab-treated patients were treated for infections compared with \n25% of placebo-treated patients. \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, the incidence of serious infections including pneumonia was \nhigher in infliximab plus methotrexate-treated patients compared with methotrexate alone \nespecially at doses of 6 mg/kg or greater (see section 4.4). \n \nIn post-marketing spontaneous reporting, infections are the most common serious adverse reaction. \nSome of the cases have resulted in a fatal outcome. Nearly 50% of reported deaths have been \nassociated with infection. Cases of tuberculosis, sometimes fatal, including miliary tuberculosis and \ntuberculosis with extra-pulmonary location have been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn clinical studies with infliximab in which 5,780 patients were treated, representing 5,494 patient \nyears, 5 cases of lymphomas and 26 non-lymphoma malignancies were detected as compared with \nno lymphomas and 1 non-lymphoma malignancy in 1,600 placebo-treated patients representing 941 \npatient years. \n \nIn long-term safety follow-up of clinical studies with infliximab of up to 5 years, representing 6,234 \npatients-years (3,210 patients), 5 cases of lymphoma and 38 cases of non-lymphoma malignancies \nwere reported. \n \nCases of malignancies, including lymphoma, have also been reported in the post-marketing setting \n(see section 4.4). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical study involving patients with moderate to severe COPD who were either \ncurrent smokers or ex-smokers, 157 adult patients were treated with infliximab at doses similar to \nthose used in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Nine of these patients developed \nmalignancies, including 1 lymphoma. The median duration of follow-up was 0.8 years (incidence \n5.7% [95% CI 2.65%-10.6%]. There was one reported malignancy amongst 77 control patients \n(median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; incidence 1.3% [95% CI 0.03%-7.0%]). The majority of \nthe malignancies developed in the lung or head and neck. \n \nA population-based retrospective cohort study found an increased incidence of cervical cancer in \nwomen with rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab compared to biologics-na\u00efve patients or \nthe general population, including those over 60 years of age (see section 4.4). \n \nIn addition, post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients \ntreated with infliximab with the vast majority of cases occurring in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative \ncolitis, and most of whom were adolescent or young adult males (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nHeart failure \n \nIn a Phase II study aimed at evaluating infliximab in CHF, higher incidence of mortality due to \nworsening of heart failure were seen in patients treated with infliximab, especially those treated \nwith the higher dose of 10 mg/kg (i.e. twice the maximum approved dose). In this study 150 \npatients with NYHA Class III-IV CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction \u2264 35%) were treated with 3 \ninfusions of infliximab 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or placebo over 6 weeks. At 38 weeks, 9 of 101 patients \ntreated with infliximab (2 at 5 mg/kg and 7 at 10 mg/kg) died compared to one death among the 49 \npatients on placebo. \nThere have been post-marketing reports of worsening heart failure, with and without identifiable \nprecipitating factors, in patients taking infliximab. There have also been post-marketing reports of \nnew onset heart failure, including heart failure in patients without known pre-existing \ncardiovascular disease. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age. \n \nHepatobiliary events \n \nIn clinical studies, mild or moderate elevations of ALT and AST have been observed in patients \nreceiving infliximab without progression to severe hepatic injury. Elevations of ALT \u2265 5 x Upper \nLimit of Normal (ULN) have been observed (see Table 2). Elevations of aminotransferases were \nobserved (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving infliximab \nthan in controls, both when infliximab was given as monotherapy and when it was used in \ncombination with other immunosuppressive agents. Most aminotransferase abnormalities were \ntransient; however, a small number of patients experienced more prolonged elevations. In general, \npatients who developed ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities \ndecreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of infliximab, or modification of \nconcomitant therapy. In post-marketing surveillance, cases of jaundice and hepatitis, some with \nfeatures of autoimmune hepatitis, have been reported in patients receiving infliximab (see section \n4.4). \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nTable 2 \nProportion of patients with increased ALT activity in clinical studies \n\n1 Placebo patients received methotrexate while infliximab patients received both infliximab \nand methotrexate. \n\n2 Placebo patients in the two Phase III studies in Crohn\u2019s disease, received an initial dose of \n5 mg/kg infliximab at study start and were on placebo in the maintenance phase. Patients \nwho were randomised to the placebo maintenance group and then later crossed over to \ninfliximab are included in the infliximab group in the ALT analysis. In the Phase IIIb trial in \nCrohn\u2019s disease, placebo patients received AZA 2.5 mg/kg/day as active control in addition \nto placebo infliximab infusions. \n\n3 Number of patients evaluated for ALT. \n4 Median follow-up is based on patients treated. \n \nAntinuclear antibodies (ANA)/Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies \n \nApproximately half of infliximab-treated patients in clinical studies who were ANA negative at \nbaseline developed a positive ANA during the study compared with approximately one fifth of \nplacebo-treated patients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were newly detected in approximately 17% of \ninfliximab-treated patients compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. At the last evaluation, \n57% of infliximab-treated patients remained anti-dsDNA positive. Reports of lupus and lupus-like \nsyndromes, however, remain uncommon (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients \n \nInfliximab was studied in a clinical study in 120 patients (age range: 4-17 years old) with active \njuvenile rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate. Patients received 3 or 6 mg/kg infliximab as a 3-\ndose induction regimen (weeks 0, 2, 6 or weeks 14, 16, 20 respectively) followed by maintenance \ntherapy every 8 weeks, in combination with methotrexate. \n \n\n \nIndication \n\nNumber of patients\n3\n Median follow-up \n\n(wks)4 \n \n\n\u2265 3 x ULN \n \n\n\u2265 5 x ULN \n\nplacebo infliximab placebo infliximab placebo infliximab placebo infliximab \nRheumatoid \narthritis\n\n1\n \n\n375 1,087 58.1 58.3 3.2% 3.9% 0.8% 0.9% \n\nCrohn\u2019s \ndisease\n\n2\n \n\n324 1,034 53.7 54.0 2.2% 4.9% 0.0% 1.5% \n\nPaediatric \nCrohn\u2019s \ndisease \n\nN/A 139 N/A 53.0 N/A 4.4% N/A 1.5% \n\nUlcerative \ncolitis \n\n242 482 30.1 30.8 1.2% 2.5% 0.4% 0.6% \n\nPaediatric \nUlcerative \ncolitis \n\nN/A 60 N/A 49.4 N/A 6.7% N/A 1.7% \n\nAnkylosing \nspondylitis \n\n76 275 24.1 101.9 0.0% 9.5% 0.0% 3.6% \n\nPsoriatic \narthritis \n\n98 191 18.1 39.1 0.0% 6.8% 0.0% 2.1% \n\nPlaque \npsoriasis \n\n281 1,175 16.1 50.1 0.4% 7.7% 0.0% 3.4% \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nInfusion reactions \nInfusion reactions occurred in 35% of patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis receiving 3 mg/kg \ncompared with 17.5% of patients receiving 6 mg/kg. In the 3 mg/kg Infliximab group, 4 out of 60 \npatients had a serious infusion reaction and 3 patients reported a possible anaphylactic reaction (2 \nof which were among the serious infusion reactions). In the 6 mg/kg group, 2 out of 57 patients had \na serious infusion reaction, one of whom had a possible anaphylactic reaction (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies to infliximab developed in 38% of patients receiving 3 mg/kg compared with 12% of \npatients receiving 6 mg/kg. The antibody titres were notably higher for the 3 mg/kg compared to the \n6 mg/kg group. \n \nInfections \nInfections occurred in 68% (41/60) of children receiving 3 mg/kg over 52 weeks, 65% (37/57) of \nchildren receiving infliximab 6 mg/kg over 38 weeks and 47% (28/60) of children receiving \nplacebo over 14 weeks (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease patients \n \nThe following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease \npatients (see section 5.1) than in adult Crohn\u2019s disease patients: anaemia (10.7%), blood in stool \n(9.7%), leukopenia (8.7%), flushing (8.7%), viral infection (7.8%), neutropenia (6.8%),  bacterial \ninfection (5.8%), and respiratory tract allergic reaction (5.8%). In addition, bone fracture (6.8%) \nwas reported, however, a causal association has not been established. Other special considerations \nare discussed below. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nIn the paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease study, 17.5% of randomised patients experienced 1 or more \ninfusion reactions. There were no serious infusion reactions, and 2 subjects in the paediatric \nCrohn\u2019s disease study had non-serious anaphylactic reactions. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies to infliximab were detected in 3 (2.9%) paediatric patients. \n \nInfections \nIn the paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease study, infections were reported in 56.3% of randomised subjects \ntreated with infliximab. Infections were reported more frequently for subjects who received q8 \nweek as opposed to q12 week infusions (73.6% and 38.0%, respectively), while serious infections \nwere reported for 3 subjects in the q8 week and 4 subjects in the q12 week maintenance treatment \ngroup. The most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection and \npharyngitis, and the most commonly reported serious infection was abscess. Three cases of \npneumonia (1 serious) and 2 cases of herpes zoster (both non-serious) were reported. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis patients \n \nOverall, the adverse reactions reported in the paediatric ulcerative colitis trial and adult ulcerative \ncolitis studies were generally consistent. In the paediatric ulcerative colitis trial, the most common \nadverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, fever, and \nheadache. The most common adverse event was worsening of ulcerative colitis, the incidence of \nwhich was higher in patients on the q12 week vs. the q8 week dosing regimen. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nOverall, 8 (13.3%) of 60 treated patients experienced one or more infusion reactions, with 4 of 22 \n(18.2%) in the q8 week and 3 of 23 (13.0%) in the q12 week treatment maintenance group. No \nserious infusion reactions were reported. All infusion reactions were mild or moderate in intensity. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies to infliximab were detected in 4 (7.7%) patients through week 54. \n \nInfections \nInfections were reported in 31 (51.7%) of 60 treated patients in the paediatric ulcerative colitis trial \nand 22 (36.7%) required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients with \ninfections in the paediatric ulcerative colitis trial was similar to that in the paediatric Crohn\u2019s \ndisease study but higher than the proportion in the adults\u2019 ulcerative colitis studies. The overall \nincidence of infections in the paediatric ulcerative colitis trial was 13/22 (59%) in the every 8 week \nmaintenance treatment group and 14/23 (60.9%) in the every 12 week maintenance treatment \ngroup. Upper respiratory tract infection (7/60 [12%]) and pharyngitis (5/60 [8%]) were the most \nfrequently reported respiratory system infections. Serious infections were reported in 12% (7/60) of \nall treated patients. \n \nIn this study, there were more patients in the 12 to 17 year age group than in the 6 to 11 year age \ngroup (45/60 [75.0%]) vs.15/60 [25.0%]). While the numbers of patients in each subgroup are too \nsmall to make any definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events, there were higher \nproportions of patients with serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events in the \nyounger age group than in the older age group. While the proportion of patients with infections was \nalso higher in the younger age group, for serious infections, the proportions were similar in the two \nage groups. Overall proportions of adverse events and infusion reactions were similar between the 6 \nto 11 and 12 to 17 year age groups. \n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nPost-marketing spontaneous serious adverse reactions with infliximab in the paediatric population \nhave included malignancies including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas, transient hepatic enzyme \nabnormalities, lupus-like syndromes, and positive auto-antibodies (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nAdditional information on special populations \n \nElderly  \nIn rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, the incidence of serious infections was greater in infliximab \nplus methotrexate-treated patients 65 years and older (11.3%) than in those under 65 years of age \n(4.6%). In patients treated with methotrexate alone, the incidence of serious infections was 5.2% in \npatients 65 years and older compared to 2.7% in patients under 65 (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. Single doses up to 20 mg/kg have been administered \nwithout toxic effects. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB02. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nZessly is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nInfliximab is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both \nsoluble and transmembrane forms of TNF\u03b1 but not to lymphotoxin \u03b1 (TNF\u00df). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nInfliximab inhibits the functional activity of TNF\u03b1 in a wide variety of in vitro bioassays. \nInfliximab prevented disease in transgenic mice that develop polyarthritis as a result of constitutive \nexpression of human TNF\u03b1 and when administered after disease onset, it allowed eroded joints to \nheal. In vivo, infliximab rapidly forms stable complexes with human TNF\u03b1, a process that parallels \nthe loss of TNF\u03b1 bioactivity. \n \nElevated concentrations of TNF\u03b1 have been found in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients and \ncorrelate with elevated disease activity. In rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with infliximab reduced \ninfiltration of inflammatory cells into inflamed areas of the joint as well as expression of molecules \nmediating cellular adhesion, chemoattraction and tissue degradation. After infliximab treatment, \npatients exhibited decreased levels of serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and \nincreased haemoglobin levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients with reduced haemoglobin levels, \ncompared with baseline. Peripheral blood lymphocytes further showed no significant decrease in \nnumber or in proliferative responses to in vitro mitogenic stimulation when compared with \nuntreated patients\u2019 cells. In psoriasis patients, treatment with infliximab resulted in decreases in \nepidermal inflammation and normalisation of keratinocyte differentiation in psoriatic plaques. In \npsoriatic arthritis, short-term treatment with infliximab reduced the number of T-cells and blood \nvessels in the synovium and psoriatic skin. \n \nHistological evaluation of colonic biopsies, obtained before and 4 weeks after administration of \ninfliximab, revealed a substantial reduction in detectable TNF\u03b1. Infliximab treatment of Crohn\u2019s \ndisease patients was also associated with a substantial reduction of the commonly elevated serum \ninflammatory marker, CRP. Total peripheral white blood cell counts were minimally affected in \ninfliximab-treated patients, although changes in lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils reflected \nshifts towards normal ranges. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from infliximab-treated \npatients showed undiminished proliferative responsiveness to stimuli compared with untreated \npatients, and no substantial changes in cytokine production by stimulated PBMC were observed \nfollowing treatment with infliximab. Analysis of lamina propria mononuclear cells obtained by \nbiopsy of the intestinal mucosa showed that infliximab treatment caused a reduction in the number \nof cells capable of expressing TNF\u03b1 and interferon\u03b3. Additional histological studies provided \nevidence that treatment with infliximab reduces the infiltration of inflammatory cells into affected \nareas of the intestine and the presence of inflammation markers at these sites. Endoscopic studies of \nintestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in infliximab-treated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAdult rheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe efficacy of infliximab was assessed in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, pivotal \nclinical studies. In both studies concurrent use of stable doses of folic acid, oral corticosteroids \n(\u2264 10 mg/day) and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was permitted. \nThe primary endpoints were the reduction of signs and symptoms as assessed by the American \nCollege of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20 for study 1 (described below), landmark ACR-N for \nstudy 2 (described below)), the prevention of structural joint damage, and the improvement in \nphysical function. A reduction in signs and symptoms was defined to be at least a 20% \nimprovement (ACR20) in both tender and swollen joint counts, and in 3 of the following 5 criteria: \n(1) evaluator\u2019s global assessment, (2) patient\u2019s global assessment, (3) functional/disability measure, \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n(4) visual analogue pain scale and (5) erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. ACR-N \nuses the same criteria as the ACR20, calculated by taking the lowest percent improvement in \nswollen joint count, tender joint count, and the median of the remaining 5 components of the ACR \nresponse. Structural joint damage (erosions and joint space narrowing) in both hands and feet was \nmeasured by the change from baseline in the total van der Heijde-modified Sharp score (0-440). \nThe Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ; scale 0-3) was used to measure patients\u2019 average \nchange from baseline scores over time, in physical function. \n \nStudy 1 evaluated responses at 30, 54 and 102 weeks in a placebo-controlled study of 428 patients \nwith active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate. Approximately 50% of \npatients were in functional Class III. Patients received placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg infliximab at \nweeks 0, 2 and 6, and then every 4 or 8 weeks thereafter. All patients were on stable methotrexate \ndoses (median 15 mg/wk) for 6 months prior to enrolment and were to remain on stable doses \nthroughout the study. \n \nResults from week 54 (ACR20, total van der Heijde-modified Sharp score and HAQ) are shown in \nTable 3. Higher degrees of clinical response (ACR50 and ACR70) were observed in all infliximab \ngroups at 30 and 54 weeks compared with methotrexate alone. \n \nA reduction in the rate of the progression of structural joint damage (erosions and joint space \nnarrowing) was observed in all infliximab groups at 54 weeks (Table 3). \n \nThe effects observed at 54 weeks were maintained through 102 weeks. Due to a number of \ntreatment withdrawals, the magnitude of the effect difference between infliximab and the \nmethotrexate alone group cannot be defined. \n \n\nTable 3 \nEffects on ACR20, Structural Joint Damage and Physical Function at week 54, study 1 \n\na control = All patients had active RA despite treatment with stable methotrexate doses for 6 \nmonths prior to enrolment and were to remain on stable doses throughout the study. \nConcurrent use of stable doses of oral corticosteroids (\u2264 10 mg/day) and/or NSAIDs was \npermitted, and folate supplementation was given. \n\n infliximabb \n Controla 3 mg/kg \n\nq 8 wks \n3 mg/kg \nq 4 wks \n\n10 mg/kg q \n8 wks \n\n10 mg/kg \nq 4 wks \n\nAll \ninfliximabb \n\nPatients with ACR20 \nresponse/ \nPatients evaluated (%) \n\n15/88 \n(17%) \n\n36/86 \n(42%) \n\n41/86 \n(48%) \n\n51/87 \n(59%) \n\n48/81 \n(59%) \n\n176/340 \n(52%) \n\n \nTotal scored (van der \nHeijde-modified Sharp \nscore) \n\n      \n\nChange from baseline \n(Mean \u00b1 SDc) \n\n7.0 \u00b1 10.3 1.3 \u00b1 6.0 1.6 \u00b1 8.5 0.2 \u00b1 3.6 -0.7 \u00b1 3.8 0.6 \u00b1 5.9 \n\nMedian \n(Interquartile range) \n \n\n4.0 \n(0.5,9.7) \n\n0.5 \n(-1.5,3.0) \n\n0.1 \n(-2.5,3.0) \n\n0.5 \n(-1.5,2.0) \n\n-0.5 \n(-3.0,1.5) \n\n0.0 \n(-1.8,2.0) \n\nPatients with no \ndeterioration/patients \nevaluated (%)c \n\n13/64 \n(20%) \n\n34/71 \n(48%) \n\n35/71 \n(49%) \n\n37/77 \n(48%) \n\n44/66 \n(67%) \n\n150/285 \n(53%) \n\n \nHAQ change from \nbaseline over timee \n(patients evaluated) \n\n87 86 85 87 81 339 \n\nMean \u00b1 SDc 0.2 \u00b1 0.3 0.4 \u00b1 0.3 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 0.5 \u00b1 0.5 0.4 \u00b1 0.4 0.4 \u00b1 0.4 \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nb all infliximab doses given in combination with methotrexate and folate with some on \ncorticosteroids and/or NSAIDs \n\nc p < 0.001, for each infliximab treatment group vs. control \nd greater values indicate more joint damage. \ne HAQ = Health Assessment Questionnaire; greater values indicate less disability. \n \nStudy 2 evaluated responses at 54 weeks in 1,004 methotrexate naive patients with early (\u2264 3 years \ndisease duration, median 0.6 years) active rheumatoid arthritis (median swollen and tender joint \ncount of 19 and 31, respectively). All patients received methotrexate (optimised to 20 mg/wk by \nweek 8) and either placebo, 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and every 8 weeks \nthereafter. Results from week 54 are shown in Table 4. \n \nAfter 54 weeks of treatment, both doses of infliximab + methotrexate resulted in statistically \nsignificantly greater improvement in signs and symptoms compared to methotrexate alone as \nmeasured by the proportion of patients achieving ACR20, 50 and 70 responses. \n \nIn study 2, more than 90% of patients had at least two evaluable X-rays. Reduction in the rate of \nprogression of structural damage was observed at weeks 30 and 54 in the infliximab + methotrexate \ngroups compared to methotrexate alone. \n \n\nTable 4 \nEffects on ACRn, Structural Joint Damage and Physical Function at week 54, study 2 \n\n infliximab + MTX \n Placebo + MTX 3 mg/kg 6 mg/kg Combined \nSubjects randomised 282 359 363 722 \nPercentage ACR improvement     \nMean \u00b1 SDa 24.8 \u00b1 59.7 37.3 \u00b1 52.8 42.0 \u00b1 47.3 39.6 \u00b1 50.1 \nChange from baseline in total van der \nHeijde-modified Sharp scoreb \n\n    \n\nMean \u00b1 SDa 3.70 \u00b1 9.61 0.42 \u00b1 5.82 0.51 \u00b1 5.55 0.46 \u00b1 5.68 \nMedian 0.43 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nImprovement from baseline in HAQ \naveraged over time from week 30 to \nweek 54c \n\n    \n\nMean \u00b1 SDd 0.68 \u00b1 0.63 0.80 \u00b1 0.65 0.88 \u00b1 0.65 0.84 \u00b1 0.65 \na p < 0.001, for each infliximab treatment group vs. control. \nb greater values indicate more joint damage. \nc HAQ = Health Assessment Questionnaire; greater values indicate less disability. \nd p = 0.030 and < 0.001 for the 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg treatment groups respectively vs. placebo \n\n+ MTX. \n \nData to support dose titration in rheumatoid arthritis come from study 1, study 2 and study 3. \nStudy 3 was a randomised, multicenter, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel-group safety study. In one of \nthe study arms (group 2, n = 329), patients with an inadequate response were allowed to dose titrate \nwith 1.5 mg/kg increments from 3 up to 9 mg/kg. The majority (67%) of these patients did not \nrequire any dose titration. Of the patients who required a dose titration, 80% achieved clinical \nresponse and the majority (64%) of these required only one adjustment of 1.5 mg/kg. \n \nAdult Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nInduction treatment in moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nThe efficacy of a single dose treatment with infliximab was assessed in 108 patients with active \nCrohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 \u2264 400) in a randomised, double-\nblinded, placebo-controlled, dose-response study. Of these 108 patients, 27 were treated with the \nrecommended dosage of infliximab 5 mg/kg. All patients had experienced an inadequate response \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nto prior conventional therapies. Concurrent use of stable doses of conventional therapies was \npermitted, and 92% of patients continued to receive these therapies. \n \nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a clinical response, defined \nas a decrease in CDAI by \u2265 70 points from baseline at the 4-week evaluation and without an \nincrease in the use of medicinal products or surgery for Crohn\u2019s disease. Patients who responded at \nweek 4 were followed to week 12. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients in \nclinical remission at week 4 (CDAI < 150) and clinical response over time. \n \nAt week 4, following administration of a single dose, 22/27 (81%) of infliximab-treated patients \nreceiving a 5 mg/kg dose achieved a clinical response vs. 4/25 (16%) of the placebo-treated patients \n(p < 0.001). Also at week 4, 13/27 (48%) of infliximab-treated patients achieved a clinical \nremission (CDAI < 150) vs. 1/25 (4%) of placebo-treated patients. A response was observed within \n2 weeks, with a maximum response at 4 weeks. At the last observation at 12 weeks, 13/27 (48%) of \ninfliximab-treated patients were still responding. \n \nMaintenance treatment in moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in adults \n \nThe efficacy of repeated infusions with infliximab was studied in a 1-year clinical study (study 4). \nA total of 573 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (CDAI \u2265 220 \u2264 400) \nreceived a single infusion of 5 mg/kg at week 0. 178 of the 580 enrolled patients (30.7%) were \ndefined as having severe disease (CDAI score > 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or \nimmunosuppressants) corresponding to the population defined in the indication (see section 4.1). At \nweek 2, all patients were assessed for clinical response and randomised to one of 3 treatment \ngroups; a placebo maintenance group, 5 mg/kg maintenance group and 10 mg/kg maintenance \ngroup. All 3 groups received repeated infusions at week 2, 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter. \n \nOf the 573 patients randomised, 335 (58%) achieved clinical response by week 2. These patients \nwere classified as week-2 responders and were included in the primary analysis (see Table 5). \nAmong patients classified as non-responders at week 2, 32% (26/81) in the placebo maintenance \ngroup and 42% (68/163) in the infliximab group achieved clinical response by week 6. There was \nno difference between groups in the number of late responders thereafter. \n \nThe co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients in clinical remission (CDAI < 150) at \nweek 30 and time to loss of response through week 54.

Eighty nine percent (50/56) of patients who lost clinical response \non infliximab 5 mg/kg maintenance therapy after week 14 responded to treatment with infliximab \n10 mg/kg. \n \nImprovements in quality of life measures, a reduction in disease-related hospitalisations and \ncorticosteroid use were seen in the infliximab maintenance groups compared with the placebo \nmaintenance group at weeks 30 and 54. \n \nInfliximab with or without AZA was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, active comparator \nstudy of 508 adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease (CDAI \u2265 220 \u2264 450) who were \nnaive to biologics and immunosuppressants and had a median disease duration of 2.3 years. At \nbaseline 27.4% of patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids, 14.2% of patients were \nreceiving budesonide, and 54.3% of patients were receiving 5-ASA compounds. Patients were \nrandomised to receive AZA monotherapy, infliximab monotherapy, or infliximab plus AZA \ncombination therapy. Infliximab was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and then \nevery 8 weeks. AZA was given at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg daily.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26, defined as \npatients in clinical remission (CDAI of < 150) who, for at least 3 weeks, had not taken oral \nsystemic corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent) or budesonide at a dose > 6 mg/day. For results \nsee Table 6. The proportions of patients with mucosal healing at week 26 were significantly greater \nin the infliximab plus AZA combination (43.9%, p < 0.001) and infliximab monotherapy groups \n(30.1%, p = 0.023) compared to the AZA monotherapy group (16.5%). \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \nTable 6 \n\nPercent of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease achieving corticosteroid-free clinical remission at \nweek 26 \n\n AZA Monotherapy infliximab \nMonotherapy \n\ninfliximab + AZA \nCombination Therapy \n\nWeek 26    \nAll randomised patients 30.0% (51/170) 44.4% (75/169)  \n\n(p = 0.006)* \n56.8% (96/169) \n (p < 0.001)* \n\n* P-values represent each infliximab treatment group vs. AZA monotherapy. \n \nSimilar trends in the achievement of corticosteroid-free clinical remission were observed at week \n50. Furthermore, improved quality of life as measured by IBDQ was observed with infliximab. \n \nInduction treatment in fistulising active Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nThe efficacy was assessed in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 94 patients \nwith fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease who had fistulas that were of at least 3 months\u2019 duration. Thirty one \nof these patients were treated with infliximab 5 mg/kg. Approximately 93% of the patients had \npreviously received antibiotic or immunosuppressive therapy. \n \nConcurrent use of stable doses of conventional therapies was permitted, and 83% of patients \ncontinued to receive at least one of these therapies. Patients received three doses of either placebo \nor infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Patients were followed up to 26 weeks. The primary endpoint \nwas the proportion of patients who experienced a clinical response, defined as \u2265 50% reduction \nfrom baseline in the number of fistulae draining upon gentle compression on at least two \nconsecutive visits (4 weeks apart), without an increase in the use of medicinal products or surgery \nfor Crohn\u2019s disease. \n \nSixty eight percent (21/31) of infliximab-treated patients receiving a 5 mg/kg dose regimen \nachieved a clinical response vs. 26% (8/31) placebo-treated patients (p = 0.002). The median time \nto onset of response in the infliximab-treated group was 2 weeks. The median duration of response \nwas 12 weeks. Additionally, closure of all fistulae was achieved in 55% of infliximab-treated \npatients compared with 13% of placebo-treated patients (p = 0.001). \n \nMaintenance treatment in fistulising active Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nThe efficacy of repeated infusions with infliximab in patients with fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease was \nstudied in a 1-year clinical study (clinical Study 5). A total of 306 patients received 3 doses of \ninfliximab 5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, and 6. At baseline, 87% of the patients had perianal fistulae, 14% \nhad abdominal fistulae, 9% had rectovaginal fistulae. The median CDAI score was 180. At week \n14, 282 patients were assessed for clinical response and randomised to receive either placebo or \n5 mg/kg infliximab every 8 weeks through week 46. \n \nWeek-14 responders (195/282) were analysed for the primary endpoint, which was time from \nrandomisation to loss of response (see Table 7). Corticosteroid tapering was permitted after week 6. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nTable 7 \nEffects on response rate in patients with fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease, data from study 5 (week-\n\n14 responders) \n                            Study 5 (week-14 responders) \n Placebo \n\nMaintenance \n(n = 99) \n\ninfliximab \nMaintenance \n\n(5 mg/kg) \n(n = 96) \n\np-value \n\nMedian time to loss of response \nthrough week 54 \n\n14 weeks > 40 weeks < 0.001 \n\nWeek 54    \nFistula Response (%) a 23.5 46.2 0.001 \nComplete fistula response (%) b 19.4 36.3 0.009 \na A \u2265 50% reduction from baseline in the number of draining fistulas over a period of \u2265 4 weeks. \nb  Absence of any draining fistulas. \n \nBeginning at week 22, patients who initially responded to treatment and subsequently lost their \nresponse were eligible to cross over to active re-treatment every 8 weeks at a dose of infliximab \n5 mg/kg higher than the dose to which they were originally randomised. Among patients in the \ninfliximab 5 mg/kg group who crossed over because of loss of fistula response after week 22, 57% \n(12/21) responded to re-treatment with infliximab 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n \nThere was no significant difference between placebo and infliximab for the proportion of patients \nwith sustained closure of all fistulas through week 54, for symptoms such as proctalgia, abscesses \nand urinary tract infection or for number of newly developed fistulas during treatment. \n \nMaintenance therapy with infliximab every 8 weeks significantly reduced disease-related \nhospitalisations and surgeries compared with placebo. Furthermore, a reduction in corticosteroid \nuse and improvements in quality of life were observed. \n \nAdult ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab were assessed in two (studies 6 and 7) randomised, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in adult patients with moderately to severely active \nulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12; Endoscopy subscore \u2265 2) with an inadequate response to \nconventional therapies [oral corticosteroids, aminosalicylates and/or immunomodulators (6-MP, \nAZA)]. Concomitant stable doses of oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents were permitted. In both studies, patients were randomised to receive \neither placebo, 5 mg/kg infliximab, or 10 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22, and in \nstudy 6 at weeks 30, 38, and 46. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nTable 8 \nEffects on clinical response in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative \n\ncolitis, clinical remission and mucosal healing at weeks 8 and 30.

At 54 weeks, 44.9% of \npatients in the combined infliximab treatment group were in clinical response compared to 19.8% in \nthe placebo treatment group (p < 0.001). Clinical remission and mucosal healing occurred in a \ngreater proportion of patients in the combined infliximab treatment group compared to the placebo \ntreatment group at week 54 (34.6% vs. 16.5%, p < 0.001 and 46.1% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.001, \nrespectively). The proportions of patients in sustained response and sustained remission at week 54 \nwere greater in the combined infliximab treatment group than in the placebo treatment group \n(37.9% vs. 14.0%, p < 0.001; and 20.2% vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001, respectively). \n \nA greater proportion of patients in the combined infliximab treatment group were able to \ndiscontinue corticosteroids while remaining in clinical remission compared to the placebo treatment \ngroup at both week 30 (22.3% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001, pooled study 6 & study 7 data) and week 54 \n(21.0% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.022, study 6 data). \n \nThe pooled data analysis from study 6 and study 7 and their extensions, analysed from baseline \nthrough 54 weeks, demonstrated a reduction of ulcerative colitis-related hospitalisations and \nsurgical procedures with infliximab treatment. The number of ulcerative colitis-related \nhospitalisations was significantly lower in the 5 and 10 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups than in \nthe placebo group (mean number of hospitalisations per 100 subject-years: 21 and 19 vs. 40 in the \nplacebo group; p = 0.019 and p = 0.007, respectively). The number of ulcerative colitis-related \nsurgical procedures was also lower in the 5 and 10 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups than in the \nplacebo group (mean number of surgical procedures per 100 subject-years: 22 and 19 vs. 34; \np = 0.145 and p = 0.022, respectively). \n \nThe proportion of subjects who underwent colectomy at any time within 54 weeks following the \nfirst infusion of study agent were collected and pooled from study 6 and study 7 and their \nextensions. Fewer subjects underwent colectomy in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group (28/242 or 11.6% \n[N.S.]) and the 10 mg/kg infliximab group (18/242 or 7.4% [p = 0.011]) than in the placebo group \n(36/244; 14.8%). \n \nThe reduction in incidence of colectomy was also examined in another randomised, double-blind \nstudy in hospitalised patients (n = 45) with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who \nfailed to respond to intravenous corticosteroids and who were therefore at higher risk for \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\ncolectomy. Significantly fewer colectomies occurred within 3 months of study infusion in patients \nwho received a single dose of 5 mg/kg infliximab compared to patients who received placebo \n(29.2% vs. 66.7% respectively, p = 0.017). \n \nIn  study 6 and study 7, infliximab improved quality of life, confirmed by statistically significant \nimprovement in both a disease specific measure, IBDQ, and by improvement in the generic 36-item \nshort form survey SF-36. \n \nAdult ankylosing spondylitis \n \nEfficacy and safety of infliximab were assessed in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled studies 8 and 9 in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (Bath Ankylosing \nSpondylitis Disease Activity Index [BASDAI] score \u2265 4 and spinal pain \u2265 4 on a scale of 1-10). \n \nIn the first study, (study 8), which had a 3 month double-blind phase, 70 patients received either \n5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6 (35 patients in each group). At week 12, placebo \npatients were switched to infliximab 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks up to week 54. After the first year of \nthe study, 53 patients continued into an open-label extension to week 102. \n \nIn the second clinical study, (study 9), 279 patients were randomised to receive either placebo \n(Group 1, n = 78) or 5 mg/kg infliximab (Group 2, n = 201) at 0, 2, and 6 weeks and every 6 weeks \nto week 24. Thereafter, all subjects continued on infliximab every 6 weeks to week 96. Group 1 \nreceived 5 mg/kg infliximab. In group 2, starting with the week 36 infusion, patients who had a \nBASDAI \u2265 3 at 2 consecutive visits, received 7.5 mg/kg infliximab every 6 weeks thereafter \nthrough week 96. \n \nIn the second clinical study (study 9), improvement in signs and symptoms was observed as early as \nweek 2. At week 24, the number of ASAS 20 responders was 15/78 (19%) in the placebo group, \nand 123/201 (61%) in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group (p < 0.001). There were 95 subjects from group \n2 who continued on 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks. At 102 weeks there were 80 subjects still on infliximab \ntreatment and among those, 71 (89%) were ASAS 20 responders. \n \nIn the first study, (study 8), improvement in signs and symptoms was also observed as early as \nweek 2. At week 12, the number of BASDAI 50 responders were 3/35 (9%) in the placebo group, \nand 20/35 (57%) in the 5 mg/kg group (p < 0.01). There were 53 subjects who continued on \n5 mg/kg every 6 weeks. At 102 weeks there were 49 subjects still on infliximab treatment and \namong those, 30 (61%) were BASDAI 50 responders. \n \nIn both studies, physical function and quality of life as measured by the BASFI and the physical \ncomponent score of the SF-36 were also improved significantly. \n \nAdult psoriatic arthritis \n \nEfficacy and safety were assessed in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in \npatients with active psoriatic arthritis (studies 10 and 11). \n \nIn the first clinical study, (study 10), efficacy and safety of infliximab were studied in 104 patients \nwith active polyarticular psoriatic arthritis. During the 16-week double-blind phase, patients \nreceived either 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14 (52 patients in each group). \nStarting at week 16, placebo patients were switched to infliximab and all patients subsequently \nreceived 5 mg/kg infliximab every 8 weeks up to week 46. After the first year of the study, \n78 patients continued into an open-label extension to week 98. \n \nIn the second clinical study, (study 11), efficacy and safety of infliximab were studied in 200 \npatients with active psoriatic arthritis (\u2265 5 swollen joints and \u2265 5 tender joints). Forty six percent of \npatients continued on stable doses of methotrexate (\u2264 25 mg/week). During the 24-week double-\nblind phase, patients received either 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22 \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n(100 patients in each group). At week 16, 47 placebo patients with < 10% improvement from \nbaseline in both swollen and tender joint counts were switched to infliximab induction (early \nescape). At week 24, all placebo-treated patients crossed over to infliximab induction. Dosing \ncontinued for all patients through week 46. \n \nKey efficacy results for study 10 and study 11 in patients with active psoriatic arthritis are shown in \nTable 9 below: \n \n\nTable 9 \nEffects on ACR and PASI in patients with active psoriatic arthritis, data from study 10 and \n\nstudy 11 \n  Study  10  Study 11* \n\n Placebo \n(week 16) \n\ninfliximab \n(week 16) \n\ninfliximab \n(week 98) \n\nPlacebo \n(week 24) \n\ninfliximab \n(week 24) \n\ninfliximab \n(week 54) \n\nPatients randomised 52 52 N/Aa 100 100 100 \nACR response \n(% of patients) \n\n      \n\nN 52 52 78 100 100 100 \nACR 20 response* 5 (10%) 34 (65%) 48 (62%) 16 (16%) 54 (54%) 53 (53%) \nACR 50 response* 0 (0%) 24 (46%) 35 (45%) 4 (4%) 41 (41%) 33 (33%) \nACR 70 response* 0 (0%) 15 (29%) 27 (35%) 2 (2%) 27 (27%) 20 (20%) \nPASI response \n(% of patients)b \n\n      \n\nN    87 83 82 \nPASI 75 response**    1 (1%) 50 (60%) 40 (48.8%) \n\n* ITT-analysis where subjects with missing data were included as non-responders. \na Week 98 data for study 10 includes combined placebo crossover and infliximab patients who \n\nentered the open-label extension. \nb Based on patients with PASI \u2265 2.5 at baseline for study 10, and patients with \u2265 3% BSA \n\npsoriasis skin involvement at baseline in study 11. \n** PASI 75 response for study 10 not included due to low N; p < 0.001 for infliximab vs. placebo \n\nat week 24 for study 11. \n \nIn study 10 and study 11 in patients with active psoriatic arthritis, clinical responses were observed \nas early as week 2 and were maintained through week 98 and week 54 respectively. Efficacy has \nbeen demonstrated with or without concomitant use of methotrexate. Decreases in parameters of \nperipheral activity characteristic of psoriatic arthritis (such as number of swollen joints, number of \npainful/tender joints, dactylitis and presence of enthesopathy) were seen in the infliximab-treated \npatients. \n \nRadiographic changes were assessed in study 11. Radiographs of hands and feet were collected at \nbaseline, weeks 24 and 54. Infliximab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint \ndamage compared with placebo treatment at the week 24 primary endpoint as measured by change \nfrom baseline in total modified vdH-S score (mean \u00b1 SD score was 0.82 \u00b1 2.62 in the placebo group \ncompared with -0.70 \u00b1 2.53 in the infliximab group; p < 0.001). In the infliximab group, the mean \nchange in total modified vdH-S score remained below 0 at the week 54 timepoint. \n \nInfliximab-treated patients demonstrated significant improvement in physical function as assessed \nby HAQ. Significant improvements in health-related quality of life were also demonstrated as \nmeasured by the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 in study 11. \n \nAdult psoriasis \n \nThe efficacy of infliximab was assessed in two multicenter, randomised, double-blind studies 12 \nand 13. Patients in both studies had plaque psoriasis (Body Surface Area [BSA] \u2265 10% and \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nPsoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score \u2265 12). The primary endpoint in both studies was the \npercent of patients who achieved \u2265 75% improvement in PASI from baseline at week 10. \n \nStudy 12 evaluated the efficacy of infliximab induction therapy in 249 patients with plaque \npsoriasis that had previously received PUVA or systemic therapy. Patients received either 3 or 5 \nmg/kg infliximab or placebo infusions at weeks 0, 2 and 6. Patients with a PGA score \u2265 3 were \neligible to receive an additional infusion of the same treatment at week 26. \n \nIn study 12 in patients with plaque psoriasis, the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 at week \n10 was 71.7% in the 3 mg/kg infliximab group, 87.9% in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group, and 5.9% \nin the placebo group (p < 0.001). By week 26, twenty weeks after the last induction dose, 30% of \npatients in the 5 mg/kg group and 13.8% of patients in the 3 mg/kg group were PASI 75 responders. \nBetween weeks 6 and 26, symptoms of psoriasis gradually returned with a median time to disease \nrelapse of > 20 weeks. No rebound was observed.  \n \nStudy 13 evaluated the efficacy of infliximab induction and maintenance therapy in 378 patients \nwith plaque psoriasis. Patients received 5 mg/kg infliximab- or placebo-infusions at weeks 0, 2, and \n6 followed by maintenance therapy every 8 weeks through week 22 in the placebo group and \nthrough week 46 in the infliximab group. At week 24, the placebo group crossed over to infliximab \ninduction therapy (5 mg/kg) followed by infliximab maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg). Nail psoriasis \nwas assessed using the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI). Prior therapy with PUVA, \nmethotrexate, cyclosporin, or acitretin had been received by 71.4% of patients, although they were \nnot necessarily therapy resistant. Key results are presented in Table 10. In infliximab treated \nsubjects, significant PASI 50 responses were apparent at the first visit (week 2) and PASI 75 \nresponses by the second visit (week 6). Efficacy was similar in the subgroup of patients that were \nexposed to previous systemic therapies compared to the overall study population. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nTable 10 \nSummary of PASI response, PGA response and percent of patients with all nails cleared at weeks 10, \n\n24, and 50.

Mean \n\nbaseline NAPSI scores were 4.6 and 4.3 in infliximab and placebo group. \n \nSignificant improvements from baseline were demonstrated in DLQI (p < 0.001) and the physical \nand mental component scores of the SF 36 (p < 0.001 for each component comparison). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease (6 to 17 years) \n \nIn the paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease study 14, 112 patients (6 to 17 years, median age 13.0 years) with \nmoderate to severe, active Crohn\u2019s disease (median paediatric CDAI of 40) and an inadequate \nresponse to conventional therapies were to receive 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. All \npatients were required to be on a stable dose of 6-MP, AZA or MTX (35% were also receiving \ncorticosteroids at baseline). Patients assessed by the investigator to be in clinical response at week \n10 were randomised and received 5 mg/kg infliximab at either q8 weeks or q12 weeks as a \nmaintenance treatment regimen. If response was lost during maintenance treatment, crossing over to \na higher dose (10 mg/kg) and/or shorter dosing interval (q8 weeks) was allowed. Thirty two (32) \nevaluable paediatric patients crossed over (9 subjects in the q8 weeks and 23 subjects in the q12 \nweeks maintenance groups). Twenty four of these patients (75.0%) regained clinical response after \ncrossing over. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nThe proportion of subjects in clinical response at week 10 was 88.4% (99/112). The proportion of \nsubjects achieving clinical remission at week 10 was 58.9% (66/112). \n \nAt week 30, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission was higher in the q8 week (59.6%, \n31/52) than the q12 week maintenance treatment group (35.3%, 18/51; p = 0.013). At week 54, the \nfigures were 55.8% (29/52) and 23.5% (12/51) in the q8 weeks and q12 weeks maintenance groups, \nrespectively (p < 0.001). Data about fistulas were derived from PCDAI scores. Of the 22 subjects \nthat had fistulas at baseline, 63.6% (14/22), 59.1% (13/22) and 68.2% (15/22) were in complete \nfistula response at week 10, 30, and 54, respectively, in the combined q8 weeks and q12 weeks \nmaintenance groups. \n \nIn addition, statistically and clinically significant improvements in quality of life and height, as well \nas a significant reduction in corticosteroid use, were observed versus baseline. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis (6 to 17 years) \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab were assessed in a multicenter, randomised, open-label, \nparallel-group clinical study 15 in 60 paediatric patients aged 6 through 17 years (median age 14.5 \nyears) with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score of 6 to 12; endoscopic \nsubscore \u2265 2) with an inadequate response to conventional therapies. At baseline 53% of patients \nwere receiving immunomodulator therapy (6-MP, AZA and/or MTX) and 62% of patients were \nreceiving corticosteroids. Discontinuation of immunomodulators and corticosteroid taper were \npermitted after week 0. \n \nAll patients received an induction regimen of 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Patients who \ndid not respond to infliximab at week 8 (n = 15) received no further medicinal product and returned \nfor safety follow-up. At week 8, 45 patients were randomised and received 5 mg/kg infliximab at \neither q8 weeks or q12 weeks as a maintenance treatment regimen. \n \nThe proportion of patients in clinical response at week 8 was 73.3% (44/60). Clinical response at \nweek 8 was similar between those with or without concomitant immunomodulator use at baseline. \nClinical remission at week 8 was 33.3% (17/51) as measured by the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis \nActivity Index (PUCAI) score. \n \nAt week 54, the proportion of patients in clinical remission as measured by the PUCAI score was \n38% (8/21) in the q8 week maintenance group and 18% (4/22) in the q12 week maintenance \ntreatment group. For patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline, the proportion of patients in \nremission and not receiving corticosteroids at week 54 was 38.5% (5/13) for the q8 week and 0% \n(0/13) for the q12 week maintenance treatment group. \n \nIn this study, there were more patients in the 12 to 17 year age group than in the 6 to 11 year age \ngroup (45/60 vs.15/60). While the numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to draw \ndefinitive conclusions about the effect of age, there was a higher number of patients in the younger \nage group who stepped up in dose or discontinued treatment due to inadequate efficacy. \n \nOther paediatric indications \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with  \nthe reference medicinal product containing infliximab in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nrheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis \nand Crohn's disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSingle intravenous infusions of 1, 3, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg of infliximab yielded dose proportional \nincreases in the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve \n(AUC). The volume of distribution at steady state (median Vd of 3.0 to 4.1 litres) was not dependent \non the administered dose and indicated that infliximab is predominantly distributed within the \nvascular compartment. No time-dependency of the Pharmacokinetics was observed. The \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nelimination pathways for infliximab have not been characterised. Unchanged infliximab was not \ndetected in urine. No major age- or weight-related differences in clearance or volume of distribution \nwere observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The pharmacokinetics of infliximab in elderly \npatients has not been studied. Studies have not been performed in patients with liver or renal \ndisease. \n \nAt single doses of 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg, the median Cmax values were 77, 118, and 277 micrograms/ml, \nrespectively. The median terminal half-life at these doses ranged from 8 to 9.5 days. In most \npatients, infliximab could be detected in the serum for at least 8 weeks after the recommended \nsingle dose of 5 mg/kg for Crohn\u2019s disease and the rheumatoid arthritis maintenance dose of \n3 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n \nRepeated administration of infliximab (5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks in fistulising Crohn\u00b4\u2019s disease, \n3 or 10 mg/kg every 4 or 8 weeks in rheumatoid arthritis) resulted in a slight accumulation of \ninfliximab in serum after the second dose. No further clinically relevant accumulation was \nobserved. In most fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease patients, infliximab was detected in serum for \n12 weeks (range 4-28 weeks) after administration of the regimen. \n \nPaediatric population \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis based on data obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis \n(N = 60), Crohn\u2019s disease (N = 112), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (N = 117) and Kawasaki disease \n(N = 16) with an overall age range from 2 months to 17 years indicated that exposure to infliximab \nwas dependent on body weight in a non-linear way. Following administration of 5 mg/kg infliximab \nevery 8 weeks, the predicted median steady-state infliximab exposure (area under concentration-\ntime curve at steady state, AUCss) in paediatric patients aged 6 years to 17 years was \napproximately 20% lower than the predicted median steady-state drug exposure in adults. The \nmedian AUCss in paediatric patients aged 2 years to less than 6 years was predicted to be \napproximately 40% lower than that in adults, although the number of patients supporting this \nestimate is limited. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nInfliximab does not cross react with TNF\u03b1 from species other than human and chimpanzee. \nTherefore, conventional preclinical safety data with infliximab are limited. In a developmental \ntoxicity study conducted in mice using an analogous antibody that selectively inhibits the functional \nactivity of mouse TNF\u03b1, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or \nteratogenicity. In a fertility and general reproductive function study, the number of pregnant mice \nwas reduced following administration of the same analogous antibody. It is not known whether this \nfinding was due to effects on the males and/or the females. In a 6-month repeated dose toxicity \nstudy in mice, using the same analogous antibody against mouse TNF\u03b1, crystalline deposits were \nobserved on the lens capsule of some of the treated male mice. No specific ophthalmologic \nexaminations have been performed in patients to investigate the relevance of this finding for \nhumans. \nLong-term studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of infliximab. \nStudies in mice deficient in TNF\u03b1 demonstrated no increase in tumours when challenged with \nknown tumour initiators and/or promoters. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nDisodium succinate hexahydrate \nSuccinic acid \nSucrose  \nPolysorbate 80  \n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other \nmedicinal products. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nBefore reconstitution: \n \n4 years at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C. \n \nZessly may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 30\u00b0C for a single period of up to \n6 months, but not exceeding the original expiry date. The new expiry date must be written on the \ncarton. Upon removal from refrigerated storage, Zessly must not be returned to refrigerated storage. \n \nAfter reconstitution: \n \nChemical and physical in use stability of the reconstituted solution has been demonstrated for \n24 hours at 2 \u00b0C \u2013 30 \u00b0C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used as soon \nas possible but within 3 hours of reconstitution and dilution. If not used immediately, in use storage \ntimes and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 \nhours at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C. \n \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \n \nFor storage conditions up to 30\u00b0C before reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.  \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nType 1 glass vial with rubber stopper and aluminium crimp protected by a plastic cap. \n \nZessly is available in packs containing 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 vials.  \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n1. Calculate the dose and the number of Zessly vials needed. Each Zessly vial contains 100 mg \n\ninfliximab. Calculate the total volume of reconstituted Zessly solution required. \n \n2. Under aseptic conditions, reconstitute each Zessly vial with 10 ml of water for injections, \n\nusing a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge (0.8 mm) or smaller needle. Remove flip-top from \nthe vial and wipe the top with a 70% alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial \nthrough the centre of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of water for injections to the \nglass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilised \npowder. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution \non reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. \nCheck that the solution is colourless to light brown and opalescent. The solution may develop \na few fine translucent particles, as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if opaque particles, \ndiscolouration, or other foreign particles are present. \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n3. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted Zessly solution dose to 250 ml with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. Do not dilute the reconstituted Zessly solution \nwith any other diluent. The dilution can be accomplished by withdrawing a volume of the \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion from the 250-ml glass bottle or \ninfusion bag equal to the volume of reconstituted Zessly. Slowly add the total volume of \nreconstituted Zessly solution to the 250-ml infusion bottle or bag. Gently mix. \n\n \n4. Administer the infusion solution over a period of not less than the infusion time \n\nrecommended (see section 4.2). Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-\npyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 1.2 micrometre or less). Since no preservative \nis present, it is recommended that the administration of the solution for infusion is to be \nstarted as soon as possible and within 3 hours of reconstitution and dilution. When \nreconstitution and dilution are performed under aseptic conditions, Zessly infusion solution \ncan be used within 24 hours if stored at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C. Do not store any unused portion of the \ninfusion solution for reuse. \n\n \n5. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-\n\nadministration of Zessly with other agents. Do not infuse Zessly concomitantly in the same \nintravenous line with other agents. \n\n \n6. Visually inspect Zessly for particulate matter or discolouration prior to administration. Do \n\nnot use if visibly opaque particles, discolouration or foreign particles are observed. \n \n7. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with \n\nlocal requirements. \n \n \n7.

What you need to know before you use Zessly \n3. How Zessly will be given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zessly \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zessly is and what it is used for \n \nZessly contains the active substance infliximab. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody - a type of \nprotein that attaches to a specific target in the body called TNF (tumour necrosis factor) alpha. \n \nZessly belongs to a group of medicines called \u2018TNF blockers\u2019. It is used in adults for the following \ninflammatory diseases: \n\u2022 Rheumatoid arthritis \n\u2022 Psoriatic arthritis \n\u2022 Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew\u2019s disease) \n\u2022 Psoriasis. \n \nZessly is also used in adults and children 6 years of age or older for: \n\u2022 Crohn\u2019s disease \n\u2022 Ulcerative colitis. \n \nZessly works by selectively attaching to TNF alpha and blocking its action. TNF alpha is involved \nin inflammatory processes of the body so blocking it can reduce the inflammation in your body. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. If you have active rheumatoid arthritis \nyou will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be \ngiven Zessly which you will take in combinationwith another medicine called methotrexate to: \n\u2022 Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease \n\u2022 Slow down the damage in your joints \n\u2022 Improve your physical function. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you \nhave active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not \nwork well enough, you will be given Zessly to: \n\u2022 Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease \n\u2022 Slow down the damage in your joints \n\u2022 Improve your physical function. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (Bechterew\u2019s disease) \nAnkylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine. If you have ankylosing spondylitis \nyou will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be \ngiven Zessly to: \n\u2022 Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease \n\u2022 Improve your physical function. \n \nPsoriasis \nPsoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, \nyou will first be given other medicines or treatments, such as phototherapy. If these medicines or \ntreatments do not work well enough, you will be given Zessly to reduce the signs and symptoms of \nyour disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis you will \nfirst be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given \nZessly to treat your disease. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have Crohn\u2019s disease you will first \nbe given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Zessly to: \n\u2022 treat active Crohn\u2019s disease \n\u2022 reduce the number of abnormal openings (fistulae) between your bowel and your skin that \n\nhave not been controlled by other medicines or surgery. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Zessly \n \nYou should not be given Zessly if: \n\u2022 You are allergic to infliximab or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\u2022 You are allergic (hypersensitive) to proteins that come from mice. \n\u2022 You have tuberculosis (TB) or another serious infection such as pneumonia or sepsis.  \n\u2022 You have heart failure that is moderate or severe. \n \nDo not use Zessly if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nyou are given Zessly. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before or during treatment with Zessly if you have: \n \nHad treatment with any medicine containing infliximab before \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have had treatment with medicines containing infliximab in the past \n\nand are now starting Zessly treatment again. \n\u2022 If you have had a break in your treatment with infliximab of more than 16 weeks, there is a \n\nhigher risk for allergic reactions when you start the treatment again. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nInfections \n\u2022 Tell your doctor before you are given Zessly if you have an infection, even if it is a very \n\nminor one. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor before you are given Zessly if you have ever lived in or travelled to an area \n\nwhere infections called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are common. \nThese infections are caused by specific types of fungi that can affect the lungs or other parts \nof your body. \n\n\u2022 You may get infections more easily when you are being treated with Zessly. If you are 65 or \nolder, you have a greater risk. \n\n\u2022 These infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, \nbacteria or other organisms in the environment and sepsis that may be life-threatening. \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get signs of infection during treatment with Zessly. Signs \ninclude fever, cough, flu-like signs, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, wounds or dental problems. \nYour doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Zessly. \n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n\u2022 It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had TB or if you have been in \n\nclose contact with someone who has had or has TB. \n\u2022 Your doctor will test you to see if you have TB. Cases of TB have been reported in patients \n\ntreated with infliximab, even in patients who have already been treated with medicines for \nTB. Your doctor will record these tests on your patient reminder card. \n\n\u2022 If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated with medicines for TB \nbefore you are given Zessly. \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get signs of TB during treatment with Zessly. Signs include \npersistent cough, weight loss, feeling tired, fever, night sweats. \n \nHepatitis B virus  \n\u2022 Tell your doctor before you are given Zessly if you are a carrier of hepatitis B or have ever \n\nhad it. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis B. \n\u2022 Your doctor should test you for hepatitis B virus. \n\u2022 Treatment with TNF blockers such as Zessly may result in reactivation of hepatitis B virus in \n\npatients who carry this virus, which can be life-threatening in some cases. \n \nHeart problems \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have any heart problems, such as mild heart failure. \n\u2022 Your doctor will want to closely monitor your heart. \nTell your doctor straight away if you get new or worsening signs of heart failure during treatment \nwith Zessly. Signs include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet. \n \nCancer and lymphoma \n\u2022 Tell your doctor before you are given Zessly if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type \n\nof blood cancer) or any other cancer. \n\u2022 Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at \n\nhigher risk of developing lymphoma. \n\u2022 Children and adults taking Zessly may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or \n\nanother cancer. \n\u2022 Some patients who have received TNF-blockers, including infliximab, have developed a rare \n\ntype of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Of these patients, most were teenage \nboys or young men and most had either Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. This type of \ncancer has usually resulted in death. Almost all patients had also received medicines \ncontaining azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in addition to TNF-blockers. \n\n\u2022 Some patients treated with infliximab have developed certain kinds of skin cancer. If there \nare any changes in your skin or growths on the skin during or after therapy, tell your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Some women being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with infliximab have developed cervical \ncancer. For women taking Zessly including those over 60 years of age, your doctor may \nrecommend regular screening for cervical cancer. \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \nLung disease or heavy smoking \n\u2022 Tell your doctor before you are given Zessly if you have a lung disease called chronic \n\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or if you are a heavy smoker. \n\u2022 Patients with COPD and patients who are heavy smokers may have a higher risk of \n\ndeveloping cancer with Zessly treatment. \n \nNervous system disease \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a problem that affects your nervous system \n\nbefore you are given Zessly. This includes multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, if \nyou have fits or have been diagnosed with \u2018optic neuritis\u2019. \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of a nerve disease during treatment with Zessly. \nSigns include changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs, numbness or tingling in any \npart of your body. \n \nAbnormal skin openings \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have any abnormal skin openings (fistulae) before you are given \n\nZessly. \n \nVaccinations \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you recently have had or are due to have a vaccine. \n\u2022 You should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Zessly treatment. You may \n\nreceive some vaccines during treatment with Zessly but you should not receive live    \nvaccines (vaccines that contain a living but weakened infectious agent) while using Zessly \nbecause they may cause infections. \n\n\u2022 If you received Zessly while you were pregnant, your baby may also be at higher risk for \ngetting an infection with live vaccines for up to six months after birth. It is important that you \ntell your baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about your Zessly use so they can \ndecide when your baby should receive any vaccine, including live vaccines such as BCG \n(used to prevent tuberculosis). For more information see section on Pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding. \n\n \nTherapeutic infectious agents \n\u2022 Talk to you doctor if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment with a \n\ntherapeutic infectious agent (such as BCG instillation used for the treatment of cancer). \n \nOperations or dental procedures \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures. \n\u2022 Tell your surgeon or dentist that you are having treatment with Zessly by showing them your \n\npatient reminder card. \n \nLiver problems \n\u2022 Some patients receiving treatment with medicines containing infliximab have developed \n\nserious liver problems. \nTell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of liver problems during treatment with Zessly. \nSigns include yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark-brown coloured urine, pain or swelling in the \nupper right side of the stomach area, joint pain, skin rashes, or fever. \n \nLow blood counts \n\u2022 In some patients receiving treatment with medicines containing infliximab, the body may not \n\nmake enough of the blood cells that help fight infections or help stop bleeding. \nTell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of low blood counts during treatment with \nZessly. Signs include persistent fever, bleeding or bruising more easily, small red or purple spots \ncaused by bleeding under the skin, or looking pale. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nImmune system disorder \n\u2022 Some patients receiving treatment with medicines containing infliximab have developed \n\nsymptoms of an immune system disorder called lupus. \nTell your doctor straight away if you develop symptoms of lupus during treatment with Zessly. \nSigns include joint pain or a rash on cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe information above also applies to children and adolescents. In addition: \n\u2022 Some children and teenage patients who have received TNF-blockers such as infliximab have \n\ndeveloped cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. \n\u2022 More children taking infliximab developed infections as compared to adults. \n\u2022 Children should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Zessly treatment. \n\nChildren may receive some vaccines during treatment with Zessly but should not receive live \nvaccines while using Zessly. \n\n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor before you are given Zessly. \n \nOther medicines and Zessly \nPatients who have inflammatory diseases already take medicines to treat their problem. These \nmedicines may cause side effects. Your doctor will advise you what other medicines you must keep \nusing while you are having Zessly. \n \nTell your doctor if you are using or have recently used any other medicines, including any other \nmedicines to treat Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, \npsoriatic arthritis or psoriasis or medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins and \nherbal medicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are using any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 Medicines that affect your immune system. \n\u2022 Kineret (anakinra). Zessly and Kineret should not be used together. \n\u2022 Orencia (abatacept). Zessly and Orencia should not be used together. \n \nWhile using Zessly you should not receive live vaccines. If you were using Zessly during \npregnancy, tell your baby\u2019s doctor and other health care professionals caring for your baby about \nyour Zessly use before the baby receives any vaccines. \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using \nZessly. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility \n\u2022 If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a \n\nbaby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Zessly should only be used \nduring pregnancy if your doctor feels it is necessary for you. \n\n\u2022 You should avoid getting pregnant when you are being treated with Zessly and for 6 months \nafter you stop being treated with it. Discuss the use of contraception during this time with \nyour doctor. \n\n\u2022 Do not breast-feed when you are being treated with Zessly or for 6 months after your last \ntreatment with Zessly. \n\n\u2022 If you received Zessly during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting \nan infection. \n\n\u2022 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about \nyour Zessly use before your baby is given any vaccine. If you received Zessly while \npregnant, giving BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis) to your baby within 6 months \nafter birth may result in infection with serious complications, including death. Live vaccines \nsuch as BCG should not be given to your baby within 6 months after birth. For more \ninformation see section on vaccination. \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n\u2022 Severely decreased numbers of white blood cells have been reported in infants born to \nwomen treated with infliximab during pregnancy. If your baby has continual fevers or \ninfections, contact your baby\u2019s doctor immediately. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nZessly is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel tired, dizzy or \nunwell after having Zessly, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n \nZessly contains Sodium \nZessly contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \nHowever, before Zessly is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that contains sodium. Talk to \nyour doctor if you are on a low salt diet. \n \n \n3. How to use Zessly \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nThe usual dose is 3 mg for every kg of body weight. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew\u2019s disease), psoriasis, ulcerative colitis \nand Crohn's disease \nThe usual dose is 5 mg for every kg of body weight. \n \nHow Zessly is given \n\u2022 Zessly will be given to you by your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 Your doctor or nurse will prepare the medicine for infusion. \n\u2022 The medicine will be given as an infusion (drip) over a 2 hours into one of your veins, \n\nusually in your arm. After the third treatment, your doctor may decide to give your dose of  \nZessly over 1 hour. \n\n\u2022 You will be monitored while you are given Zessly and also for 1 to 2 hours afterwards. \n \nHow much Zessly is given \n\u2022 The doctor will decide your dose and how often you will be given Zessly. This will depend \n\non your disease, weight and how well you respond to Zessly. \n\u2022 The table below shows how often you will usually have this medicine after your first dose. \n \n\n2nd dose 2 weeks after your 1st treatment \n3rd dose 6 weeks after your 1st treatment \nFurther doses Every 6 to 8 weeks depending on your disease \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nZessly should only be used in children if they are being treated for Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative \ncolitis. These children must be 6 years of age or older. \n \nIf you are given too much Zessly \nAs this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too \nmuch. There are no known side effects of having too much of Zessly. \n \nIf you forget or miss your Zessly infusion \nIf you forget or miss an appointment to receive Zessly, make another appointment as soon as \npossible. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most \nside effects are mild to moderate. However some patients may experience serious side effects and \nmay require treatment.

The storage details should you need \nthem are as follows: \n\u2022 Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n\u2022 Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton after \n\u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n\u2022 Store in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \n\u2022 This medicine can also be stored in the original carton outside of refrigerated storage up to a \n\nmaximum of 30\u00b0C for a single period of up to six months, but not beyond the original expiry \ndate. In this situation, do not return to the refrigerated storage again. Write the new expiry \ndate on the carton including day/month/year. Discard this medicine if not used by the new \nexpiry date or the expiry date printed on the carton, whichever is earlier. \n\n\u2022 It is recommended that when Zessly is prepared for infusion, it is used as soon as possible \n(within 3 hours). However, if the solution is prepared in germ-free conditions, it can be \nstored in a refrigerator at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C for 24 hours. \n\n\u2022 Do not use this medicine if it is discoloured or if there are particles present. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Zessly contains \n\u2022 The active substance is infliximab. Each vial contains 100 mg of infliximab. After \n\npreparation each ml contains 10 mg of infliximab. \n\u2022 The other ingredients are disodium succinate hexahydrate, succinic acid, sucrose, \n\npolysorbate 80. \n \nWhat Zessly looks like and contents of the pack \nZessly is supplied as a glass vial containing a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n(powder for concentrate). The powder is white. \nZessly is available in packs containing 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vials. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder \n \nSandoz GmbH \nBiochemiestr. 10 \n6250 Kundl \nAustria \n \n \nManufacturer \n \nSandoz GmbH \nBiochemiestr. 10 \n6336 Langkampfen \nAustria \n \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in {MM/YYYY}. \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu.  \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nPatients treated with infliximab should be given the patient reminder card. \n \nInstructions for use and handling \u2013 storage conditions \n \nStore at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C. \n \nZessly may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 30\u00b0C for a single period of up to \n6 months, but not exceeding the original expiry date. The new expiry date must be written on the \ncarton. Upon removal from refrigerated storage, Zessly must not be returned to refrigerated storage. \n \nInstructions for use and handling \u2013 reconstitution, dilution and administration \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch \nnumber of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. \n \n \n1. Calculate the dose and the number of Zessly vials needed. Each Zessly vial contains 100 mg \n\ninfliximab. Calculate the total volume of reconstituted Zessly solution required. \n \n2. Under aseptic conditions, reconstitute each Zessly vial with 10 ml of water for injections, \n\nusing a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge (0.8 mm) or smaller needle. Remove flip-top from \nthe vial and wipe the top with a 70% alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial \nthrough the centre of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of water for injections to the \nglass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilised \npowder. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution \non reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. \nCheck that the solution is colourless to light brown and opalescent. The solution may develop \na few fine translucent particles, as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if opaque particles, \ndiscolouration, or other foreign particles are present. \n\n \n3. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted Zessly solution dose to 250 ml with sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. Do not dilute the reconstituted Zessly solution \nwith any other diluent. The dilution can be accomplished by withdrawing a volume of the \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion from the 250-ml glass bottle or \ninfusion bag equal to the volume of reconstituted Zessly. Slowly add the total volume of \nreconstituted Zessly solution to the 250-ml infusion bottle or bag. Gently mix. \n\n \n4. Administer the infusion solution over a period of not less than the infusion time \n\nrecommended. \nUse only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter \n(pore size 1.2 micrometre or less). Since no preservative is present, it is recommended that \nthe administration of the solution for infusion is to be started as soon as possible and within 3 \nhours of reconstitution and dilution. When reconstitution and dilution are performed under \naseptic conditions, Zessly infusion solution can be used within 24 hours if stored at 2\u00b0C \u2013\n 8\u00b0C. Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. \n\n \n5. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-\n\nadministration of Zessly with other agents. Do not infuse Zessly concomitantly in the same \nintravenous line with other agents. \n\n \n6. Visually inspect Zessly for particulate matter or discolouration prior to administration. Do \n\nnot use if visibly opaque particles, discolouration or foreign particles are observed. \n \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n7. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

you are allergic to infliximab or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). you are allergic (hypersensitive) to proteins that come from mice. you have tuberculosis (tb) or another serious infection such as pneumonia or sepsis. you have heart failure that is moderate or severe. do not use zessly if any of the above applies to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor before you are given zessly. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before or during treatment with zessly if you have: had treatment with any medicine containing infliximab before tell your doctor if you have had treatment with medicines containing infliximab in the past and are now starting zessly treatment again. if you have had a break in your treatment with infliximab of more than 16 weeks, there is a higher risk for allergic reactions when you start the treatment again. infections tell your doctor before you are given zessly if you have an infection, even if it is a very minor one. tell your doctor before you are given zessly if you have ever lived in or travelled to an area where infections called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are common. these infections are caused by specific types of fungi that can affect the lungs or other parts of your body. you may get infections more easily when you are being treated with zessly. if you are 65 or older, you have a greater risk. these infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, bacteria or other organisms in the environment and sepsis that may be life-threatening. tell your doctor straight away if you get signs of infection during treatment with zessly. signs include fever, cough, flu-like signs, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, wounds or dental problems. your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping zessly. tuberculosis (tb) it is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tb or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had or has tb. your doctor will test you to see if you have tb. cases of tb have been reported in patients treated with infliximab, even in patients who have already been treated with medicines for tb. your doctor will record these tests on your patient reminder card. if your doctor feels that you are at risk for tb, you may be treated with medicines for tb before you are given zessly. tell your doctor straight away if you get signs of tb during treatment with zessly. signs include persistent cough, weight loss, feeling tired, fever, night sweats. hepatitis b virus tell your doctor before you are given zessly if you are a carrier of hepatitis b or have ever had it. tell your doctor if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis b. your doctor should test you for hepatitis b virus. treatment with tnf blockers such as zessly may result in reactivation of hepatitis b virus in patients who carry this virus, which can be life-threatening in some cases. heart problems tell your doctor if you have any heart problems, such as mild heart failure. your doctor will want to closely monitor your heart. tell your doctor straight away if you get new or worsening signs of heart failure during treatment with zessly. signs include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet. cancer and lymphoma tell your doctor before you are given zessly if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any other cancer. patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher risk of developing lymphoma. children and adults taking zessly may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another cancer. some patients who have received tnf-blockers, including infliximab, have developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic t-cell lymphoma. of these patients, most were teenage boys or young men and most had either crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. this type of cancer has usually resulted in death. almost all patients had also received medicines containing azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in addition to tnf-blockers. some patients treated with infliximab have developed certain kinds of skin cancer. if there are any changes in your skin or growths on the skin during or after therapy, tell your doctor. some women being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with infliximab have developed cervical cancer. for women taking zessly including those over 60 years of age, your doctor may recommend regular screening for cervical cancer. lung disease or heavy smoking tell your doctor before you are given zessly if you have a lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) or if you are a heavy smoker. patients with copd and patients who are heavy smokers may have a higher risk of developing cancer with zessly treatment. nervous system disease tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a problem that affects your nervous system before you are given zessly. this includes multiple sclerosis, guillain-barr\u00e9 syndrome, if you have fits or have been diagnosed with 'optic neuritis'. tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of a nerve disease during treatment with zessly. signs include changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs, numbness or tingling in any part of your body. abnormal skin openings tell your doctor if you have any abnormal skin openings (fistulae) before you are given zessly. vaccinations talk to your doctor if you recently have had or are due to have a vaccine. you should receive recommended vaccinations before starting zessly treatment. you may receive some vaccines during treatment with zessly but you should not receive live vaccines (vaccines that contain a living but weakened infectious agent) while using zessly because they may cause infections. if you received zessly while you were pregnant, your baby may also be at higher risk for getting an infection with live vaccines for up to six months after birth. it is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about your zessly use so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine, including live vaccines such as bcg (used to prevent tuberculosis). for more information see section on pregnancy and breast- feeding. therapeutic infectious agents talk to you doctor if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment with a therapeutic infectious agent (such as bcg instillation used for the treatment of cancer). operations or dental procedures tell your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures. tell your surgeon or dentist that you are having treatment with zessly by showing them your patient reminder card. liver problems some patients receiving treatment with medicines containing infliximab have developed serious liver problems. tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of liver problems during treatment with zessly. signs include yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark-brown coloured urine, pain or swelling in the upper right side of the stomach area, joint pain, skin rashes, or fever. low blood counts in some patients receiving treatment with medicines containing infliximab, the body may not make enough of the blood cells that help fight infections or help stop bleeding. tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of low blood counts during treatment with zessly. signs include persistent fever, bleeding or bruising more easily, small red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin, or looking pale. immune system disorder some patients receiving treatment with medicines containing infliximab have developed symptoms of an immune system disorder called lupus. tell your doctor straight away if you develop symptoms of lupus during treatment with zessly. signs include joint pain or a rash on cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun. children and adolescents the information above also applies to children and adolescents. in addition: some children and teenage patients who have received tnf-blockers such as infliximab have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. more children taking infliximab developed infections as compared to adults. children should receive recommended vaccinations before starting zessly treatment. children may receive some vaccines during treatment with zessly but should not receive live vaccines while using zessly. if you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor before you are given zessly. other medicines and zessly patients who have inflammatory diseases already take medicines to treat their problem. these medicines may cause side effects. your doctor will advise you what other medicines you must keep using while you are having zessly. tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used any other medicines, including any other medicines to treat crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis or medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins and herbal medicines. in particular, tell your doctor if you are using any of the following medicines: medicines that affect your immune system. kineret (anakinra). zessly and kineret should not be used together. orencia (abatacept). zessly and orencia should not be used together. while using zessly you should not receive live vaccines. if you were using zessly during pregnancy, tell your baby's doctor and other health care professionals caring for your baby about your zessly use before the baby receives any vaccines. if you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using zessly. pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. zessly should only be used during pregnancy if your doctor feels it is necessary for you. you should avoid getting pregnant when you are being treated with zessly and for 6 months after you stop being treated with it. discuss the use of contraception during this time with your doctor. do not breast-feed when you are being treated with zessly or for 6 months after your last treatment with zessly. if you received zessly during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. it is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your zessly use before your baby is given any vaccine. if you received zessly while pregnant, giving bcg vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis) to your baby within 6 months after birth may result in infection with serious complications, including death. live vaccines such as bcg should not be given to your baby within 6 months after birth. for more information see section on
