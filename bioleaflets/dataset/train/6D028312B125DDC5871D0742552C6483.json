PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n\nClear, colourless viscous solution. \n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nBusulfan followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) is indicated as conditioning treatment prior to \n\nconventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in adult patients when the \n\ncombination is considered the best available option. \n\n \n\nBusulfan following fludarabine (FB) is indicated as conditioning treatment prior to haematopoietic \nprogenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in adult patients who are candidates for a reduced-intensity \nconditioning (RIC) regimen. \n\n \n\nBusulfan followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy4) or melphalan (BuMel) is indicated as conditioning \n\ntreatment prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation in paediatric patients. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nBusulfan administration should be supervised by a physician experienced in conditioning treatment \n\nprior to haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. \n\n \n\nBusulfan is administered prior to the haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT). \n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nBusulfan in combination with cyclophosphamide or melphalan  \n\n \n\nIn adults \n\nThe recommended dose and schedule of administration is: \n\n \n\n- 0.8 mg/kg body weight (BW) of busulfan as a two-hour infusion every 6 hours over 4 consecutive \n\ndays for a total of 16 doses, \n\n- followed by cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg/day over 2 days initiated for at least 24 hours \n\nfollowing the 16th dose of busulfan (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (0 to 17 years)  \n\nThe recommended dose of busulfan is as follows: \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\nActual body weight (kg) Busulfan dose (mg/kg) \n\n< 9 1.0 \n\n9 to < 16 1.2 \n\n16 to 23 1.1 \n\n> 23 to 34 0.95 \n\n> 34 0.8 \n\n \n\nfollowed by: \n\n- 4 cycles of 50 mg/kg body weight (BW) cyclophosphamide (BuCy4) or \n\n-  one administration of 140 mg/m\u00b2 melphalan (BuMel) \n\n initiated for at least 24 hours following the 16th dose of busulfan (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nBusulfan is administered as a two-hour infusion every 6 hours over 4 consecutive days for a total of \n\n16 doses prior to cyclophosphamide or melphalan and haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation \n\n(HPCT). \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nPatients older than 50 years of age (n=23) have been successfully treated with busulfan without  \n\ndose-adjustment. However, for the safe use of busulfan in patients older than 60 years only limited \n\ninformation is available. Same dose (see section 5.2) for elderly patients as for adults (< 50 years old) \n\nshould be used. \n\n \n\nBusulfan in combination with fludarabine (FB) \n\nIn adults  \n\nThe recommended dose and schedule of administration is: \n\n- fludarabine administered as a single daily one-hour infusion at 30 mg/m\u00b2 for 5 consecutive \n\ndays or 40 mg/m\u00b2 for 4 consecutive days. \n\n- Busulfan will be administered at 3.2 mg/kg as a single daily three-hour infusion immediately \n\nafter fludarabine for 2 or 3 consecutive days.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (0 to 17 years) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of FB in pediatric population has not been established. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nThe administration of FB regimen has not been specifically investigated in elderly patients. However, \n\nmore than 500 patients aged \u2265 55 years were reported in publications with FB conditioning regimens, \n\nyielding efficacy outcomes similar to younger patients. No dose adjustment was deemed necessary.  \n\n \n\nObese patients \n\nIn adults \n\nFor obese patients, dosing based on adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) should be considered. \n\n \n\nIdeal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: \n\nIBW men (kg) = 50 + 0.91x (height in cm-152); \n\nIBW women (kg) = 45 + 0.91x (height in cm-152). \n\n \n\nAdjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) is calculated as follows: \n\nAIBW= IBW + 0.25x (actual body weight-IBW). \n\n \n\nIn paediatric population \n\nThe medicinal product is not recommended in obese children and adolescents with body mass index \n\nWeight (kg)/ (m2) > 30 kg/m\u00b2 until further data become available. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nStudies in renally impaired patients have not been conducted, however, as busulfan is moderately \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\nexcreted in the urine, dose modification is not recommended in these patients. \n\nHowever, caution is recommended (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nBusulfan has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\nCaution is recommended, particularly in those patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nBusulfan is for intravenous use. \n\n \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n\nThis medicinal product must be diluted prior to administration. A final concentration of approximately \n\n0.5 mg/ml busulfan should be achieved. Busulfan should be administered by intravenous infusion via \n\ncentral venous catheter. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nBusulfan should not be given by rapid intravenous, bolus or peripheral injection. \n\nAll patients should be pre-medicated with anticonvulsant medicinal products to prevent seizures \n\nreported with the use of high dose busulfan. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended to administer anticonvulsants 12 h prior to busulfan to 24 h after the last dose of \n\nbusulfan. \n\n \n\nIn adult and paediatric studies, patients received either phenytoin or benzodiazepines as seizure \n\nprophylaxis treatment (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nAntiemetics should be administered prior to the first dose of busulfan and continued on a fixed schedule \n\naccording to local practice through its administration. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nPregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThe consequence of treatment with busulfan at the recommended dose and schedule is profound \n\nmyelosuppression, occurring in all patients. Severe granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, or \n\nany combination thereof may develop. Frequent complete blood counts, including differential white \n\nblood cell counts, and platelet counts should be monitored during the treatment and until recovery is \n\nachieved. \n\nProphylactic or empiric use of anti-infectives (bacterial, fungal, viral) should be considered for the \n\nprevention and management of infections during the neutropenic period. Platelet and red blood cell \n\nsupport, as well as the use of growth factors such as granulocyte colony stimulating agent (G-CSF), \n\nshould be employed as medically indicated. \n\n \n\nIn adults, absolute neutrophil counts < 0.5x109/l at a median of 4 days post transplant occurred in 100% \n\nof patients and recovered at median day 10 and 13 days following autologous and allogeneic transplant \n\nrespectively (median neutropenic period of 6 and 9 days respectively). \n\nThrombocytopenia (< 25x109/l or requiring platelet transfusion) occurred at a median of 5-6 days in \n\n98% of patients. Anaemia (haemoglobin< 8.0 g/dl) occurred in 69% of patients. \n\n \n\nIn paediatric population, absolute neutrophil counts < 0.5x109/l at a median of 3 days post transplant \n\noccurred in 100% of patients and lasted 5 and 18.5 days in autologous and allogeneic transplant \n\nrespectively. In children, thrombocytopenia (< 25x109/l or requiring platelet transfusion) occurred in \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n100% of patients. Anaemia (haemoglobin< 8.0 g/dl) occurred in 100% of patients. \n\nIn children < 9 kg, a therapeutic drug monitoring may be justified on a case by case basis, in particular \n\nin extremely young children and neonates (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe Fanconi anaemia cells have hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents. There is limited clinical \n\nexperience of the use of busulfan as a component of a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in children \n\nwith Fanconi\u2019s anaemia. Therefore busulfan should be used with caution in this type of patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nBusulfan has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Since busulfan is mainly \n\nmetabolized through the liver, caution should be observed when busulfan is used in patients with \n\npre-existing impairment of liver function, especially in those with severe hepatic impairment. \n\nIt is recommended when treating these patients that serum transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and \n\nbilirubin should be monitored regularly 28 days following transplant for early detection of \n\nhepatotoxicity. \n\n \n\nHepatic veno-occlusive disease is a major complication that can occur during treatment with busulfan. \n\nPatients who have received prior radiation therapy, greater than or equal to three cycles of \n\nchemotherapy, or prior progenitor cell transplant may be at an increased risk (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when using paracetamol prior to (less than 72 hours) or concurrently with \n\nbusulfan due to a possible decrease in the metabolism of busulfan (See section 4.5). \n\n \n\nAs documented in clinical studies, no treated patients experienced cardiac tamponade or other specific \n\ncardiac toxicities related to busulfan. However cardiac function should be monitored regularly in \n\npatients receiving busulfan (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nOccurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome with subsequent respiratory failure associated with \n\ninterstitial pulmonary fibrosis was reported in busulfan studies in one patient who died, although, no \n\nclear aetiology was identified. In addition, busulfan might induce pulmonary toxicity that may be \n\nadditive to the effects produced by other cytotoxic agents. Therefore, attention should be paid to this \n\npulmonary issue in patients with prior history of mediastinal or pulmonary radiation (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPeriodic monitoring of renal function should be considered during therapy with busulfan (see section \n\n4.8). \n\n \n\nSeizures have been reported with high dose busulfan treatment. Special caution should be exercised \nwhen administering the recommended dose of busulfan to patients with a history of seizures. Patients \nshould receive adequate anticonvulsant prophylaxis. In adults and children studies, data with busulfan \nwere obtained when using concomitant administration of either phenytoin or benzodiazepines for \nseizure prophylaxis. The effect of those anticonvulsant agents on busulfan pharmacokinetics was \ninvestigated in a phase II study (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe increased risk of a second malignancy should be explained to the patient. On the basis of human \ndata, busulfan has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a \nhuman carcinogen. The World Health Organisation has concluded that there is a causal relationship \nbetween busulfan exposure and cancer. Leukaemia patients treated with busulfan developed many \ndifferent cytological abnormalities, and some developed carcinomas. Busulfan is thought to be \nleukemogenic. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nBusulfan can impair fertility. Therefore, men treated with busulfan are advised not to father a child \n\nduring and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on cryo-conservation of sperm prior to \n\ntreatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with busulfan. \n\nOvarian suppression and amenorrhoea with menopausal symptoms commonly occur in \n\npre-menopausal patients. Busulfan treatment in a pre-adolescent girl prevented the onset of puberty \n\ndue to ovarian failure. Impotence, sterility, azoospermia, and testicular atrophy have been reported in \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nmale patients. The solvent dimethylacetamide (DMA) may also impair fertility. DMA decreases \n\nfertility in male and female rodents (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n\n \n\nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), including fatal \n\ncases, have been reported in high-dose conditioning regimens in which busulfan was administered in \n\ncombination with another conditioning treatment. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo specific clinical trial was carried out to assess drug-drug interaction between intravenous busulfan \n\nand itraconazole or metronidazole. From published studies in adults, administration of itraconazole to \n\npatients receiving high-dose busulfan may result in reduced busulfan clearance. Also, there are \n\npublished case reports of increased plasma levels of busulfan after administration of metronidazole. \n\nPatients who are concurrently treated with busulfan and itraconazole or metronidazole should be \n\nclosely monitored for signs of busulfan toxicity. \n\nNo interaction was observed when busulfan was combined with fluconazole (antifungal agent). \n\n \n\nPublished studies in adults described that ketobemidone (analgesic) might be associated with high \n\nlevels of plasma busulfan. Therefore special care is recommended when combining these two \n\ncompounds. \n\n \n\nIn adults, for the BuCy2 regimen it has been reported that the time interval between the last oral \n\nbusulfan administration and the first cyclophosphamide administration may influence the development \n\nof toxicities. A reduced incidence of Hepatic Veno Occlusive Disease (HVOD) and other \n\nregimen-related toxicity have been observed in patients when the lag time between the last dose of oral \n\nbusulfan and the first dose of cyclophosphamide is > 24hours. \n\n \n\nThere is no common metabolism pathway between busulfan and fludarabine.  \n\nIn adults, for the FB regimen, published studies did not report any mutual drug-drug interaction \nbetween intravenous busulfan and fludarabine. \n\n \n\nIn paediatric population, for the BuMel regimen it has been reported that the administration of \n\nmelphalan less than 24 hours after the last oral busulfan administration may influence the development \n\nof toxicities. \n\n \n\nIncreases in busulfan exposure have been observed at concomitant administration of busulfan and \ndeferasirox. The mechanism behind the interaction is not fully elucidated. It is recommended to \nregularly monitor busulfan plasma concentrations and, if necessary, adjust the busulfan dose in patients \nwho are or have recently been treated with deferasirox. \n\n \n\nParacetamol is described to decrease glutathione levels in blood and tissues, and may therefore decrease \nbusulfan clearance when used in combination (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nEither phenytoin or benzodiazepines were administered for seizure prophylaxis in patients \n\nparticipating to the clinical trials conducted with intravenous busulfan (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nThe concomitant systemic administration of phenytoin to patients receiving high-dose of oral busulfan \n\nhas been reported to increase busulfan clearance, due to induction of glutathion-S-transferase whereas \n\nno interaction has been reported when benzodiazepines such as diazepam, clonazepam or lorazepam \n\nhave been used to prevent seizures with high-dose busulfan. \n\nNo evidence of an induction effect of phenytoin has been seen on busulfan data. \n\nA phase II clinical trial was performed to evaluate the influence of seizure prophylaxis treatment on \n\nintravenous busulfan pharmacokinetics. In this study, 24 adult patients received clonazepam \n\n(0.025-0.03 mg/kg/day as IV continuous infusions) as anticonvulsant therapy and the PK data of these \n\npatients were compared to historical data collected in patients treated with phenytoin. The analysis of \n\ndata through a population pharmacokinetic method indicated no difference on intravenous busulfan \n\nclearance between phenytoin and clonazepam based therapy and therefore similar busulfan plasma \n\nexposures were achieved whatever the type of seizure prophylaxis. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNo interaction was observed when busulfan was combined with 5 HT3 antiemetics such as ondansetron \n\nor granisetron. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 6 months after \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nHPCT is contraindicated in pregnant women; therefore, busulfan is contraindicated during pregnancy. \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (embryo-foetal lethality and malformations) (see \n\nsection 5.3) \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of busulfan or DMA in pregnant women. A few \n\ncases of congenital abnormalities have been reported with low-dose oral busulfan, not necessarily \n\nattributable to the active substance, and third trimester exposure may be associated with impaired \n\nintrauterine growth. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether busulfan and DMA are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for \n\ntumorigenicity shown for busulfan in human and animal studies, breast-feeding should be \n\ndiscontinued during treatment with busulfan. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nBusulfan and DMA can impair fertility in man or woman. Therefore it is advised not to father child \n\nduring the treatment and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on cryo-conservation of \n\nsperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNot relevant \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nBusulfan in combination with cyclophosphamide or melphalan  \n\nIn adults \n\nAdverse reactions information is derived from two clinical trials (n=103) of busulfan. \n\nSerious toxicities involving the haematologic, hepatic and respiratory systems were considered as \n\nexpected consequences of the conditioning regimen and transplant process. These include infection and \n\nGraft-versus host disease (GVHD) which although not directly related, were the major causes of \n\nmorbidity and mortality, especially in allogeneic HPCT. \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nMyelo-suppression and immuno-suppression were the desired therapeutic effects of the conditioning \n\nregimen. Therefore all patients experienced profound cytopenia: leucopenia 96%, thrombocytopenia \n\n94%, and anemia 88%. The median time to neutropenia was 4 days for both autologous and allogeneic \n\npatients. The median duration of neutropenia was 6 days and 9 days for autologous and allogeneic \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nThe incidence of acute graft versus host disease (a-GVHD) data was collected in OMC-BUS-4 study \n\n(allogeneic)(n=61). A total of 11 patients (18%) experienced a-GVHD. The incidence of a-GVHD \n\ngrades I-II was 13% (8/61), while the incidence of grade III-IV was 5% (3/61). Acute GVHD was rated \n\nas serious in 3 patients. Chronic GVHD (c-GVHD) was reported if serious or the cause of death, and \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nwas reported as the cause of death in 3 patients. \n\nInfections and infestations \n\n39% of patients (40/103) experienced one or more episodes of infection, of which 83% (33/40) were \n\nrated as mild or moderate. Pneumonia was fatal in 1% (1/103) and life-threatening in 3% of patients. \n\nOther infections were considered severe in 3% of patients. Fever was reported in 87% of patients and \n\ngraded as mild/moderate in 84% and severe in 3%. 47% of patients experienced chills which were \n\nmild/moderate in 46% and severe in 1%. \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\n15% of SAEs involved liver toxicity. HVOD is a recognized potential complication of conditioning \n\ntherapy post-transplant. Six of 103 patients (6%) experienced HVOD. HVOD occurred in: 8.2% (5/61) \n\nallogeneic patients (fatal in 2 patients) and 2.5% (1/42) of autologous patients. Elevated bilirubin (n=3) \n\nand elevated AST (n=1) were also observed. Two of the above four patients with serious serum \n\nhepatotoxicity were among patients with diagnosed HVOD. \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \n\nOne patient experienced a fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome with subsequent respiratory \n\nfailure associated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in the busulfan studies. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAdverse reactions information are derived from the clinical study in paediatrics (n=55). Serious \n\ntoxicities involving the hepatic and respiratory systems were considered as expected consequences of \n\nthe conditioning regimen and transplant process. \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nThe incidence of acute graft versus host disease (a-GVHD) data was collected in allogeneic patients \n\n(n=28). A total of 14 patients (50%) experienced a-GVHD. The incidence of a-GVHD grades I-II was \n\n46.4% (13/28), while the incidence of grade III-IV was 3.6% (1/28). Chronic GVHD was reported only \n\nif it is the cause of death: one patient died 13 months post-transplant. \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nInfections (documented and non documented febrile neutropenia) were experienced in 89% of patients \n\n(49/55). Mild/moderate fever was reported in 76% of patients. \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\nGrade 3 elevated transaminases were reported in 24% of patients. \n\nVeno occlusive disease (VOD) was reported in 15% (4/27) and 7% (2/28) of the autologous and \n\nallogenic transplant respectively. VOD observed were neither fatal nor severe and resolved in all cases. \n\n \n\nBusulfan in combination with fludarabine (FB)  \n\nIn adults \n\nThe safety profile of busulfan combined with fludarabine (FB) has been examined through a review of \n\nadverse reactions reported in published data from clinical trials in RIC regimen. In these studies, a total \n\nof 1574 patients received FB as a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen prior to haematopoietic \n\nprogenitor cell transplantation.  \n\n \n\nMyelo-suppression and immuno-suppression were the desired therapeutic effects of the conditioning \n\nregimen and consequently were not considered undesirable effects. \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations  \n\nThe occurrence of infectious episodes or reactivation of opportunistic infectious agents mainly reflects \n\nthe immune status of the patient receiving a conditioning regimen.  \n\nThe most frequent infectious adverse reactions were Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation [range: \n\n30.7% - 80.0%], Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation [range: 2.3% - 61%], bacterial infections \n\n[range: 32.0% - 38.9%] and viral infections [range: 1.3% - 17.2%]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nThe highest frequency of nausea and vomiting was 59.1% and the highest frequency of stomatitis was \n\n11%. \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nIt has been suggested that conditioning regimens containing fludarabine were associated with higher \n\nincidence of opportunistic infections after transplantation because of the immunosuppressive effect of \n\nfludarabine. Late haemorrhagic cystitis occurring 2 weeks post-transplant are likely related to viral \n\ninfection / reactivation. Haemorrhagic cystitis including haemorrhagic cystitis induced by viral \n\ninfection was reported in a range between 16% and 18.1%.  \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders \n\nVOD was reported with a range between 3.9% and 15.4%. \n\n \n\nThe treatment-related mortality/non-relapse mortality (TRM/NRM) reported until day+100 post-\n\ntransplant has also been examined through a review of published data from clinical trials.

The haematologic status should be closely monitored and \n\nvigorous supportive measures instituted as medically indicated. \n\nThere have been two reports that busulfan is dialyzable, thus dialysis should be considered in the case \n\nof an overdose. Since, busulfan is metabolized through conjugation with glutathione, administration of \n\nglutathione might be considered. \n\n \n\nIt must be considered that overdose of busulfan will also increase exposure to DMA. In human the \n\nprincipal toxic effects were hepatotoxicity and central nervous system (CNS) effects. CNS changes \n\nprecede any of the more severe side effects. No specific antidote for DMA overdose is known. \n\nIn case of overdose, management would include general supportive care. \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, alkylating agents, alkyl sulfonates, ATC code: \n\nL01AB01.  \n \nMechanism of action \n\nBusulfan is a potent cytotoxic agent and a bifunctional alkylating agent. In aqueous media, release of \nthe methanesulphonate groups produces carbonium ions which can alkylate DNA, thought to be an \n\nimportant biological mechanism for its cytotoxic effect. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nBusulfan in combination with cyclophosphamide \n\nIn adults \n\nDocumentation on the safety and efficacy of busulfan in combination with cyclophosphamide in the \n\nBuCy2 regimen prior to conventional allogeneic and/or autologous HPCT derives from two clinical \n\ntrials (OMC-BUS-4 and OMC-BUS-3). \n\n \n\nTwo prospective, single arm, open-label, uncontrolled phase II studies were conducted in patients with \n\nhaematological disease, the majority of whom had advanced disease. \n\n \n\nDiseases included were acute leukaemia past first remission, in first or subsequent relapse, in first \n\nremission (high risk), or induction failures; chronic melogenous leukaemia in chronic or advanced \n\nphase; primary refractory or resistant relapsed Hodgkin\u2019s disease or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and \n\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. \n\n \n\nPatients received doses of 0.8 mg/kg busulfan every 6 hours infusion for a total 16 doses followed by \n\ncyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg once per day for two days (BuCy2 regimen). \n\nThe primary efficacy parameters in these studies were myeloablation, engraftment, relapse, and \n\nsurvival. \n\nIn both studies, all patients received a 16/16 dose regimen of busulfan. No patients were discontinued \n\nfrom treatment due to adverse reactions related to busulfan. \n\n \n\nAll patients experienced a profound myelosuppression. The time to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \n\ngreater than 0.5x109 /l was 13 days (range 9-29 days) in allogenic patients (OMC-BUS 4), and 10 days \n\n(range 8-19 days) in autologous patients (OMC-BUS 3). All evaluable patients engrafted. There is no \n\nprimary nor secondary graft rejection. Overall mortality and non-relapse mortality at more than \n\n100 days post-transplant was (8/61) 13% and (6/61) 10% in allotransplanted patients, respectively. \n\nDuring the same period there was no death in autologous recipients. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nDocumentation of the safety and efficacy of busulfan in combination with cyclophosphamide in the \n\nBuCy4 or with melphalan in the BuMel regimen prior to conventional allogeneic and/or autologous \n\nHPCT derives from clinical trial F60002 IN 101 G0. \n\nThe patients received the dosing mentioned in section 4.2. \n\nAll patients experienced a profound myelosuppression. The time to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \n\ngreater than 0.5x109/l was 21 days (range 12-47 days) in allogenic patients, and 11 days (range 10-15 \n\ndays) in autologous patients. All children engrafted. There is no primary or secondary graft rejection. \n\n93% of allogeneic patients showed complete chimerism. There was no regimen-related death through \n\nthe first 100-day post-transplant and up to one year post-transplant. \n\n \n\nBusulfan in combination with fludarabine (FB)  \n\nIn adults \n\nDocumentation on the safety and efficacy of busulfan in combination with fludarabine (FB) prior to \n\nallogeneic HPCT derives from the literature review of 7 published studies involving 731 patients with \n\nmyeloid and lymphoid malignancies reporting the use of intravenous busulfan infused once daily \n\ninstead of four doses per day.  \n\n \n\nPatients received a conditioning regimen based on the administration of fludarabine immediately \n\nfollowed by single daily dose of 3.2 mg/kg busulfan over 2 or 3 consecutive days. Total dose of \n\nbusulfan per patient was between 6.4 mg/kg and 9.6 mg/kg. \n\nThe FB combination allowed sufficient myeloablation modulated by the intensity of conditioning \n\nregimen through the variation of number of days of busulfan infusion. Fast and complete engraftment \n\nrates in 80-100% of patients were reported in the majority of studies. A majority of publications \n\nreported a complete donor chimerism at day+30 for 90-100% of patients. The long-term outcomes \n\nconfirmed that the efficacy was maintained without unexpected effects.  \n\n \n\nData from a recently completed prospective multicentre phase 2 study including 80 patients, aged 18 to \n\n65 years old, diagnosed with different hematologic malignancies who underwent allo-HCT with an FB \n\n(3 days of busulfan) reduced intensity conditioning regimen became available. In this study, all, but one, \n\npatients engrafted, at a median of 15 (range, 10-23) days after allo-HCT. The cumulative incidence of \n\nneutrophil recovery at day 28 was 98.8% (95%CI, 85.7-99.9%). Platelet engraftment occurred at a \n\nmedian of 9 (range, 1-16) days after allo-HCT.  \n\nThe 2-year OS rate was 61.9% (95%CI, 51.1-72.7%)]. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of NRM \n\nwas 11.3% (95%CI, 5.5-19.3%), and that of relapse or progression from allo-HCT was 43.8% (95CI, \n\n31.1-55.7%). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of DFS at 2 years was 49.9% (95%CI, 32.6-72.7). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of busulfan has been investigated. The information presented on \n\nbiotransformation and elimination is based on oral busulfan. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in adults \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of intravenous busulfan was studied in 124 evaluable patients following a \n\n2-hour intravenous infusion for a total of 16 doses over four days. Immediate and complete \n\navailability of the dose is obtained after intravenous infusion of busulfan. Similar blood exposure \n\nwas observed when comparing plasma concentrations in adult patients receiving oral and intravenous \n\nbusulfan at 1 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg respectively. Low inter (CV=21%) and intra (CV=12%) patient \n\nvariability on busulfan exposure was demonstrated through a population pharmacokinetic analysis, \n\nperformed on 102 patients. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nTerminal volume of distribution Vz ranged between 0.62 and 0.85 l/kg. \n\nBusulfan concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are comparable to those in plasma although these \nconcentrations are probably insufficient for anti-neoplastic activity. \n\nReversible binding to plasma proteins was around 7% while irreversible binding, primarily to albumin, \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\nwas about 32%. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nBusulfan is metabolised mainly through conjugation with glutathione (spontaneous and \n\nglutathione-S-transferase mediated). The glutathione conjugate is then further metabolised in the liver \n\nby oxidation. None of the metabolites is thought to contribute significantly to either efficacy or \n\ntoxicity. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nTotal clearance in plasma ranged 2.25 - 2.74 ml/minute/kg. The terminal half-life ranged from 2.8 to \n\n3.9 hours. \n\nApproximately 30% of the administered dose is excreted into the urine over 48 hours with 1% as \n\nunchanged busulfan. Elimination in faeces is negligible. Irreversible protein binding may explain the \n\nincomplete recovery. Contribution of long-lasting metabolites is not excluded. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nThe dose proportional increase of busulfan exposure was demonstrated following intravenous busulfan \n\nup to 1 mg/kg. \n\nCompared to the four times a day regimen, the once-daily regimen is characterized by a higher peak \n\nconcentration, no drug accumulation and a wash out period (without circulating busulfan \n\nconcentration) between consecutive administrations. The review of the literature allows a comparison \n\nof PK series performed either within the same study or between studies and demonstrated unchanged \n\ndose-independent PK parameters regardless the dosage or the schedule of administration. It seems that \n\nthe recommended intravenous busulfan dose administered either as an individual infusion (3.2 mg/kg) \n\nor into 4 divided infusions (0.8 mg/kg) provided equivalent daily plasma exposure with similar both \n\ninter-and intrapatient variability. As a result, the control of intravenous busulfan AUC within the \n\ntherapeutic windows is not modified and a similar targeting performance between the two schedules \n\nwas illustrated. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships \n\nThe literature on busulfan suggests a therapeutic AUC window between 900 and 1500 \u00b5mol/L.minute \n\nper administration (equivalent to a daily exposure between 3600 and 6000 \u00b5mol/L.minute). During \n\nclinical trials with intravenous busulfan administered as 0.80 mg/kg four-times daily, 90% of patients \n\nAUCs were below the upper AUC limit (1500 \u00b5mol/L.minute) and at least 80% were within the \n\ntargeted therapeutic window (900 - 1500 \u00b5mol/L.minute). Similar targeting rate is achieved within the \n\ndaily exposure of 3600 - 6000 \u00b5mol/L.minute following the administration of intravenous busulfan \n\n3.2 mg/kg once daily. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nHepatic or renal impairment \n\nThe effects of renal dysfunction on intravenous busulfan disposition have not been assessed. \n\nThe effects of hepatic dysfunction on intravenous busulfan disposition have not been assessed. \n\nNevertheless the risk of liver toxicity may be increased in this population. \n\nNo age effect on busulfan clearance was evidenced from available intravenous busulfan data in \n\npatients over 60 years. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nA continuous variation of clearance ranging from 2.49 to 3.92 ml/minute/kg has been established in \n\nchildren from < 6 months up to 17 years old. The terminal half life ranged from 2.26 to 2.52 h. \n\nInter and intra patient variabilities in plasma exposure were lower than 20% and 10%, respectively. \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed in a cohort of 205 children adequately \n\ndistributed with respect to bodyweight (3.5 to 62.5 kg), biological and diseases (malignant and \n\nnon-malignant) characteristics, thus representative of the high heterogeneity of children undergoing \n\nHPCT. This study demonstrated that bodyweight was the predominant covariate to explain the busulfan \n\npharmacokinetic variability in children over body surface area or age. \n\nThe recommended posology for children as detailed in section 4.2 enabled over 70% up to 90% of \n\nchildren \u2265 9kg in achieving the therapeutic window (900 - 1500 \u00b5mol/L.minute). However a higher \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\nvariability was observed in children < 9 kg leading to 60% of children achieving the therapeutic \n\nwindow (900 - 1500 \u00b5mol/L.minute). For the 40% of children < 9 kg outside the target, the AUC \n\nwas evenly distributed either below or above the targeted limits; i.e. 20% each < 900 and \n\n> 1500 \u00b5mol/L.min following 1 mg/kg. In this regard, for children < 9 kg, a monitoring of the \n\nplasma concentrations of busulfan (therapeutic drug monitoring) for dose-adjustment may improve \n\nthe busulfan targeting performance, especially in extremely young children and neonates. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships: \n\nThe successful engraftment achieved in all patients during phase II trials suggests the appropriateness \n\nof the targeted AUCs. Occurrence of VOD was not related to overexposure. PK/PD relationship was \n\nobserved between stomatitis and AUCs in autologous patients and between bilirubin increase and \n\nAUCs in a combined autologous and allogeneic patient analysis. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nBusulfan is mutagenic and clastogenic. Busulfan was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium, \n\nDrosophila melanogaster and barley. Busulfan induced chromosomal aberrations in vitro (rodent and \n\nhuman cell) and in vivo (rodents and humans). Various chromosome aberrations have been observed in \n\ncells from patients receiving oral busulfan. \n\n \n\nBusulfan belongs to a class of substances which are potentially carcinogenic based on their mechanism \n\nof action. On the basis of human data, busulfan has been classified by the IARC as a human \n\ncarcinogen. WHO has concluded that there is a causal relationship between busulfan exposure and \n\ncancer. The available data in animals support the carcinogenic potential of busulfan. Intravenous \n\nadministration of busulfan to mice significantly increased the incidences of thymic and ovarian \n\ntumours. \n\n \n\nBusulfan is a teratogen in rats, mice and rabbits. Malformations and anomalies included significant \n\nalterations in the musculoskeletal system, body weight gain, and size. In pregnant rats, busulfan \n\nproduced sterility in both male and female offspring due to the absence of germinal cells in testes and \n\novaries. Busulfan was shown to cause sterility in rodents. Busulfan depleted oocytes of female rats, \n\nand induced sterility in male rats and hamster. \n\n \n\nRepeated doses of DMA produced signs of liver toxicity, the first being increases in serum clinical \n\nenzymes followed by histopatological changes in the hepatocytes. Higher doses can produce hepatic \n\nnecrosis and liver damage can be seen following single high exposures. \n\n \n\nDMA is teratogenic in rats. Doses of 400 mg/kg/day DMA administered during organogenesis caused \n\nsignificant developmental anomalies. The malformations included serious heart and/or major vessels \n\nanomalies: a common truncus arteriosis and no ductus arteriosis, coarctation of the pulmonary trunk \n\nand the pulmonary arteries, intraventricular defects of the heart. Other frequent anomalies included \n\ncleft palate, anasarca and skeletal anomalies of the vertebrae and ribs. DMA decreases fertility in male \n\nand female rodents. A single s.c. dose of 2.2 g/kg administered on gestation day 4 terminated \n\npregnancy in 100% of tested hamster. In rats, a DMA daily dose of 450 mg/kg given to rats for nine \n\ndays caused inactive spermatogenesis. \n \n \n\n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n\n \n\nDimethylacetamide \n\nMacrogol 400 \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n\n \n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\nproducts except those mentioned in section 6.6. \n\n \n\nPolycarbonate syringes must not be used with busulfan. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n\n \n\nVials \n 2 years. \n\n \nDiluted solution \n \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability after dilution in glucose 5% or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection has been demonstrated for: \n\n \n\n- 8 hours (including infusion time) after dilution when stored at 25\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C \n\n \n\n- 12 hours after dilution when stored at 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C followed by 3 hours stored at 25\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C \n\n(including infusion time). \n\n \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after dilution. \n\nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \n\nuser and would normally not be longer than the above-mentioned conditions when dilution has taken \n\nplace in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C). \n\nDo not freeze the diluted solution. \n\nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\n \n\n10 ml of concentrate for solution for infusion in clear colourless glass vials (type I) with teflon faced \n\nrubber stopper and sealed with aluminium flip-off seal.

Using a non polycarbonate syringe fitted with a needle: \n\n \n- the calculated volume of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi must be removed from the vial. \n\n \n- the contents of the syringe must be dispensed into an intravenous bag (or syringe) which \n\nalready contains the calculated amount of the selected diluent. Busulfan Fresenius Kabi \nmust always be added to the diluent, not the diluent to the Busulfan Fresenius Kabi. \nBusulfan Fresenius Kabi must not be put into an intravenous bag that does not contain \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose solution for injection 5%. \n\n\u2022 The diluted solution must be mixed thoroughly by inverting several times.  \n\n \n\nAfter dilution, 1 ml of solution for infusion contains 0.5 mg of busulfan. \n\n \n\nDiluted Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is a clear colourless solution. \n\n \n\nInstructions for use \n\nPrior to and following each infusion, flush the indwelling catheter line with approximately 5 ml of \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection. \n\n \n\nThe residual medicinal product must not be flushed in the administration tubing as rapid infusion of \nbusulfan has not been tested and is not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe entire prescribed busulfan dose should be delivered over two or three hours depending of the \nconditioning regimen. \n\n \n\nSmall volumes may be administered over 2 hours using electric syringes. In this case infusion sets with \nminimal priming space should be used (i.e 0.3-0.6 ml), primed with medicinal product solution prior to \nbeginning the actual busulfan infusion and then flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution \nfor injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\nBusulfan must not be infused concomitantly with another intravenous solution.  \n\n \n\nPolycarbonate syringes must not be used with busulfan. \n\n \n\nOnly a clear solution without any particles should be used. \n\n \n\nBusulfan is for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of \nin accordance with local requirements for cytotoxic medicinal products. \n\n \n\n \n\n7 MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n\n \n\nFresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH \n\nElse-Kr\u00f6ner-Stra\u00dfe 1, \n\n61352 Bad Homburg v.d.H\u00f6he \n\nGermany \n\n \n\n \n\n8 MARKETING AUTHORISATION NUMBER(S) \n\n \n\nEU/1/14/951/001 \n\n \n\n \n\n9 DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION \n\n \n\nDate of first authorisation: 22 September 2014 \n\nDate of latest renewal: 20 June 2019 \n\n \n\n \n\n10 DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT \n\n \n\n \n\nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of European Medicinal \nAgency http://www.ema/europa.eu \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX II \n\n \n\nA.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains the active substance busulfan, which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nalkylating agents. Busulfan Fresenius Kabi destroys the original bone marrow before the transplant. \n\n \n\nBusulfan Fresenius Kabi is used in adults, new-born infants, children and adolescents as a treatment \n\nprior to transplantation. \n\n \n\nIn adults Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is used in combination with cyclophosphamide or fludarabine. \n\n \n\nIn new-born infants, children and adolescents, this medicine is used in combination with \n\ncyclophosphamide or melphalan. \n\n \n\nYou will receive this preparative medicine before receiving a transplant of either bone marrow or \n\nhaematopoietic progenitor cell. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Busulfan Fresenius Kabi \n\n \n\nDo not use Busulfan Fresenius Kabi: \n\n- if you are allergic to busulfan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6. \n\n- if you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nBusulfan Fresenius Kabi is a potent cytotoxic medicine that results in profound decrease of blood cells. \n\nAt the recommended dose, this is the desired effect. Therefore careful monitoring will be performed.  \n\n \n\nIt is possible that use of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi may increase the risk of suffering another \n\nmalignancy in the future. You should tell your doctor: \n\n- if you have a liver, kidney, heart or lung problem, \n\n- if you have a history of seizures, \n\n- if you are currently taking other medicines. \n\n \n\nCases of formation of blood clots in the small blood vessels may appear after hematopoietic cell \n\ntransplantation (HCT) with high-dose of your treatment in combination with other medicines. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Busulfan Fresenius Kabi \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. Busulfan Fresenius Kabi may interact with other medicines \nsuch as Deferasirox (a medicine used to remove excess iron from your body). \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be taken if you use itraconazol and metronidazole (used for certain \n\ntypes of infections) or ketobemidone (used to treat pain), because this may increase the \n\nside-effects. \n\n \n\nThe use of paracetamol during the 72 hours prior to or with Busulfan Fresenius Kabi administration \n\nshould be used with caution. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor before you receive treatment with Busulfan Fresenius Kabi.

If you are concerned about having children, you should discuss this with your doctor \n\nbefore treatment. Busulfan Fresenius Kabi can also produce symptoms of menopause and in \n\npre-adolescent girls it can prevent the onset of puberty. \n\n \n\nMen treated with Busulfan Fresenius Kabi are advised not to father child during and up to 6 months after \n\ntreatment. \n \n \n3. How to use Busulfan Fresenius Kabi \n\n \n\nDose and administration \n\nThe dose of busulfan will be calculated according to your body weight. \n\n \n\nIn adults: \n\nBusulfan Fresenius Kabi in combination with cyclophosphamide: \n\n- The recommended dose of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is 0.8 mg/kg  \n\n\u2212 Each infusion will last 2 hours \n\n\u2212 Busulfan will be administered every 6 hours during 4 consecutive days prior to transplant. \n\n \n\nBusulfan Fresenius Kabi in combination with fludarabine \n\n\u2212 The recommended dose of busulfan is 3.2 mg/kg \n\n\u2212 Each infusion will last 3 hours \n\n\u2212 Busulfan will be administered once daily during 2 or 3 consecutive days prior to transplant. \n\n \n\nIn new-born infants, children and adolescents (0 to 17 years): \n\nThe recommended dose of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi in combination with cyclophosphamide or \n\nmelphalan is based on your body weight varying between 0.8 and 1.2 mg/kg. \n\n \n\n \n\nMedicines before you receive Busulfan Fresenius Kabi: \n\nBefore receiving Busulfan Fresenius Kabi, you will be medicated with \n\n- anticonvulsive medicines to prevent seizures (phenytoin or benzodiazepines) and \n\n- antiemetic medicines to prevent vomiting. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

RECOMMENDATION FOR SAFE HANDLING \n\n \n\nProcedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be considered. \n\n \n\nAll transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical \n\nlaminar flow safety hood. \n\n \n\nAs with other cytotoxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparing the busulfan \n\nsolution: \n\n- The use of gloves and protective clothing is recommended. \n\n- If the concentrate or diluted busulfan solution contacts the skin or mucosa, wash them thoroughly \n\nwith water immediately. \n\n \n\nCalculation of the quantity of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi to be diluted and of the diluent \n\n \n\nBusulfan Fresenius Kabi must be diluted prior to use with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection or glucose solution for injection 5%. \n\n \n\nThe quantity of the diluent must be 10 times the volume of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi ensuring the final \n\nconcentration of busulfan remains at approximately 0.5 mg/ml. \n\n \n\nThe amount of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi and diluent to be administered would be calculated as follows: \n\nfor a patient with a Y kg body weight: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Quantity of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi: \n\n \n\nY (kg) x D (mg/kg)  \n\n   = A ml of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi to be diluted \n\n \n\n6 (mg/ml) \n\n \n\nY: body weight of the patient in kg \n\nD: dose of busulfan (see SPC section 4.2) \n\n \n\n\u2022 Quantity of diluent: \n\n \n\n(A ml Busulfan Fresenius Kabi) x (10) = B ml of diluent \n\n \n\nTo prepare the final solution for infusion, add (A) ml of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi to (B) ml of diluent \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n(sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose solution for injection 5%). \n\n \n\nPreparation of the solution for infusion \n\n \n\nBusulfan Fresenius Kabi must be prepared by a healthcare professional using sterile transfer techniques.  \n\n\u2022 Using a non polycarbonate syringe fitted with a needle: \n\n \n\n- the calculated volume of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi must be removed from the vial. \n\n \n\n- the contents of the syringe must be dispensed into an intravenous bag (or syringe) which \n\nalready contains the calculated amount of the selected diluent. Busulfan Fresenius Kabi must \n\nalways be added to the diluent, not the diluent to the Busulfan Fresenius Kabi. Busulfan \n\nFresenius Kabi must not be put into an intravenous bag that does not contain sodium chloride \n\n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose solution for injection 5%. \n\n \n\n\u2022 The diluted solution must be mixed thoroughly by inverting several times. \n\n \n\nAfter dilution, 1 ml of solution for infusion contains 0.5 mg of busulfan. \n\n \n\nDiluted Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is a clear colourless solution \n\n \n\nInstructions for use \n\nPrior to and following each infusion, flush the indwelling catheter line with approximately 5 ml of \n\nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection. \n\n \n\nThe residual medicinal product must not be flushed in the administration tubing as rapid infusion of \n\nbusulfan has not been tested and is not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe entire prescribed busulfan dose should be delivered over two or three hours depending on the \n\nconditioning regimen. \n\n \n\nSmall volumes may be administered over 2 hours using electric syringes. In that case infusion sets with \n\nminimal priming space should be used (i.e 0.3-0.6 ml), primed with medicinal product solution prior to \n\nbeginning the actual busulfan infusion and then flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution \n\nfor injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection. \n\n \n\nBusulfan must not be infused concomitantly with another intravenous solution.  \n\n \n\nPolycarbonate syringes must not be used with busulfan. \n\n \n\nFor single use only. Only a clear solution without particles should be used. \n\n \n\nStorage conditions \n\nUnopened vials: \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \n\n \n\nDiluted solution: \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability after dilution in glucose 5% or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \n\nsolution for injection has been demonstrated for 8 hours (including infusion time) after dilution when \n\nstored at 25\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C or 12 hours after dilution when stored at 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C followed by 3 hours stored at \n\n25\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C (including infusion time). \n\n \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after dilution. \n\nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and would \n\nnormally not be longer than the above-mentioned conditions when dilution has taken place in controlled \n\nand validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nDo not freeze the diluted solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PROCEDURE FOR PROPER DISPOSAL \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements for \n\ncytotoxic medicinal products. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

vein, graft versus host disease (the graft attacks your body) and pulmonary complications. contact your doctor immediately if you get any of the following symptoms. your doctor will monitor your blood counts and liver enzymes regularly to detect and manage these events. other side effects may include: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): blood: decrease of blood circulating cells (red and white) and platelets. infections. nervous system: insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, and depression. nutrition: loss of appetite, decrease in magnesium, calcium, potassium, phosphate, albumine in
