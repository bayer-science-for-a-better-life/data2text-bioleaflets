CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nFiasp is a mealtime insulin for subcutaneous administration up to 2 minutes before the start of the \nmeal, with the option to administer up to 20 minutes after starting the meal (see section 5.1). \n \nDosing with Fiasp is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. Fiasp \ngiven by subcutaneous injection should be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-\nacting insulin given at least once a day. In a basal-bolus treatment regimen approximately 50% of this \nrequirement may be provided by Fiasp and the remaining by intermediate-acting or long-acting \ninsulin. \n \nThe individual total daily insulin requirement in adults, adolescents and children may vary and is \nusually between 0.5 and 1.0 unit/kg/day. \nBlood glucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustment are recommended to achieve optimal glycaemic \ncontrol. \n \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness. Blood glucose levels should be monitored adequately under \nthese conditions. \n \nThe duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature and level \nof physical activity. \n \nPatients on basal-bolus treatment who forget a mealtime dose are advised to monitor their blood \nglucose level to decide if an insulin dose is needed. Patients should resume their usual dosing schedule \nat the next meal. \n \nThe potency of insulin analogues, including Fiasp, is expressed in units. One (1) unit of Fiasp \ncorresponds to 1 international unit of human insulin or 1 unit of other fast-acting insulin analogues. \n \nThe early onset of action must be considered when prescribing Fiasp (see section 5.1). \n \nInitiation \nPatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus \nThe recommended starting dose in insulin naÃ¯ve patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately 50% of \nthe total daily insulin dose and should be divided between the meals based on the size and composition \nof the meals. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be administered as intermediate-\nacting or long-acting insulin. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight \ncan be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin naÃ¯ve patients with type 1 diabetes. \n \nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \nSuggested initial dose is 4 units at one or more meals. Number of injections and subsequent titration \nwill depend on the individual glycaemic target and the size and composition of the meals. \n \nDose adjustment may be considered daily based on self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) on the \nprevious day(s) according to Table 1. \nâ€¢ Pre-breakfast dose should be adjusted according to the pre-lunch SMPG the previous day \nâ€¢ Pre-lunch dose should be adjusted according to the pre-dinner SMPG the previous day \nâ€¢ Pre-dinner dose should be adjusted according to the bedtime SMPG the previous day \n \nTable 1 Dose adjustment \n\nSMPG (see above) Dose adjustment \nmmol/L mg/dL Unit \n\n<4.0 <71 -1 \n4.0â€“6.0 71â€“108 No adjustment \n\n\n\n4 \n\n>6.0 >108 +1 \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly patients (â‰¥ 65 years old) \nThe safety and efficacy of Fiasp have been established in elderly patients aged 65 to 75 years. Close \nglucose monitoring is recommended and the insulin dose should be adjusted on an individual basis \n(see section 5.1 and 5.2). The therapeutic experience in patients â‰¥ 75 years of age is limited. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce the patientâ€™s insulin requirements. In patients with renal or \nhepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual \nbasis (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nFiasp can be used in adolescents and children from the age of 1 year (see section 5.1). There is no \nclinical experience with the use of Fiasp in children below the age of 2 year. \nFiasp is recommended to be administered prior to the meal (0-2 minutes), with the flexibility to \nadminister up to 20 minutes after starting the meal in situations, when there is uncertainty about the \nmeal intake. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \nClose glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer from other mealtime insulins and in the \ninitial weeks thereafter. Converting from another mealtime insulin can be done on a unit-to-unit basis. \nTransferring a patient from another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin to Fiasp must be done under \nstrict medical supervision and may result in the need for a change in dosage. \n \nDoses and timing of concurrent intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin medicinal products or other \nconcomitant antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nSubcutaneous injection \nFiasp is recommended to be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall or the upper arm (see \nsection 5.2). Injection sites should be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of \nlipodystrophy. \n \nFiasp 100 units/mL FlexTouch solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nAdministration with a pre-filled pen (FlexTouch) \nThe pre-filled pen (FlexTouch) is designed to be used with NovoFine Plus, NovoFine or NovoTwist \ninjection needles. The pre-filled pen delivers 1â€“80 units in steps of 1 unit. \nFlexTouch is colour-coded and accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instructions for use to \nbe followed. \nThe pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If administration by syringe or \nintravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. If administration by infusion pump is \nnecessary, a vial or a PumpCart cartridge should be used. \n \nFiasp 100 units/mL Penfill solution for injection in cartridge \nAdministration with a reusable insulin pen \nThe cartridge (Penfill) is designed to be used with Novo Nordisk reusable insulin pens and NovoFine \nPlus, NovoFine or NovoTwist injection needles for subcutaneous injection only.  \nIf administration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. If \nadministration by infusion pump is necessary, a vial or a PumpCart cartridge should be used. \n \nFiasp 100 units/mL solution for injection in vial \nAdministration with a syringe \nThe vial is to be used with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale (U-100 or 100 U/mL). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nContinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) \nFiasp can be used for CSII in pumps suitable for insulin infusion and will cover both the bolus insulin \nrequirement (approximately 50%) and basal insulin. It can be administered in accordance with the \ninstructions provided by the pump manufacturer, preferably in the abdomen. Infusion site should be \nrotated within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. When used with an insulin infusion \npump, it should not be diluted or mixed with any other insulin medicinal products. \n \nPatients using CSII should be instructed in the use of the pump and use the correct reservoir and \ntubing for pump (see section 6.6). The infusion set (tubing and cannula) should be changed in \naccordance with the instructions in the product information supplied with the infusion set. \n \nPatients administering Fiasp by CSII must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have \nalternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure.  \n \nIntravenous use \nIf necessary, Fiasp can be administered intravenously by health care professionals. \nFor intravenous use, it should be used at concentrations from 0.5 unit/mL to 1.0 unit/mL insulin aspart \nin infusion systems â€“ using polypropylene infusion bags. Fiasp has been shown to be stable at room \ntemperature for 24 hours in the infusion fluids such as sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution or \n5% glucose solution. \n \nMonitoring of blood glucose is necessary during insulin infusion. Care should be taken to ensure that \nthe insulin is injected into the infusion bag and not simply the entry port.  \n \nFiasp 100 units/mL PumpCart solution for injection in cartridge \nAdministration via Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII)  \nThe cartridge (PumpCart) is only for use with an insulin infusion pump system designed to be used \nwith this cartridge, such as the Accu-Chek Insight and YpsoPump insulin pumps. \n \nFiasp will cover both the bolus insulin requirement (approximately 50%) and basal insulin. It can be \nadministered in accordance with the instructions provided by the pump manufacturer, preferably in the \nabdomen. Infusion site should be rotated within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. \n \nPatients using CSII should be instructed in the use of the pump and use the correct tubing for pump \n(see section 6.6). The infusion set (tubing and cannula) should be changed in accordance with the \ninstructions in the product information supplied with the infusion set. \n \nPatients administering Fiasp by CSII must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have \nalternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure.  \n \nThe cartridge (PumpCart) is only suitable for CSII in pump systems suitable for insulin infusion. If \nadministration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFiasp 100 units/mL PumpCart solution for injection in cartridge \nMisuse of PumpCart \nThe cartridge (PumpCart) is only for use with an insulin infusion pump system designed to be used \nwith this cartridge, such as the Accu-Chek Insight and YpsoPump insulin pumps. It must not be used \nwith other devices not designed for the cartridge, as this may result in incorrect insulin dosing and \nsubsequent hyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nOmission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see \nsections 4.8 and 4.9). \n \nPatients, whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised \naccordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with long-standing diabetes. \n \nThe timing of hypoglycaemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin \nformulation. Hypoglycaemia may occur earlier after an injection/infusion when compared to other \nmealtime insulins due to the earlier onset of action of Fiasp (see section 5.1). \n \nSince Fiasp should be administered up to 2 minutes before the start of the meal with the option to \nadminister up to 20 minutes after starting the meal, the time to onset of action must be taken into \naccount when prescribing to patients with concomitant diseases or treatment where a delayed \nabsorption of food might be expected. \n \nPaediatric population \nClose monitoring of blood glucose levels is recommended if administering this medicine after the start \nof the last meal of the day, in order to avoid nocturnal hypoglycaemia. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nThe use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, especially in patients requiring insulin, \nmay lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal. \n \nContinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) \nPump or infusion set malfunctions can lead to a fast onset of hyperglycaemia and ketosis. Prompt \nidentification and correction of the cause of hyperglycaemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim therapy \nwith subcutaneous injection may be required. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \n \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal, human insulin or human \ninsulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may \nresult in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to Fiasp from another type of insulin may \nrequire a change in dose from that used with their usual insulin medicinal products.  \n \nConcomitant illness \n \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patientâ€™s \ninsulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or \nthyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose. \n \nCombination of thiazolidinediones and insulin medicinal products  \n \nCases of congestive heart failure have been reported when thiazolidinediones were used in \ncombination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of congestive heart \nfailure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of thiazolidinediones and \ninsulin medicinal products is considered. If the combination is used, patients should be observed for \nsigns and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and oedema. Thiazolidinediones should \nbe discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nInsulin initiation and glucose control intensification  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nIntensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, \nreversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, acute painful \nperipheral neuropathy and peripheral oedema. However, long-term glycaemic control decreases the \nrisk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. \n \nInsulin antibodies \n \nInsulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin \nantibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between this medicinal product and other insulin medicinal products. \n \nPatients must visually verify the units of the dose prior to administering. Therefore, the requirement \nfor patients to self-administer is that they can read the dose scale. Patients, who are blind or have poor \nvision, must be instructed to always get assistance from another person who has good vision and is \ntrained in administration of insulins. \n \nTravelling between time zones \n \nBefore travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctorâ€™s advice. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose i.e. essentially â€˜sodium-\nfreeâ€™. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. \n \nThe following substances may reduce insulin requirement: \nOral antidiabetics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), beta-blockers, angiotensin converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids, sulphonamides and GLP-1 receptor agonist. \n \nThe following substances may increase insulin requirement: \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth \nhormone and danazol. \n \nBeta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFiasp can be used in pregnancy.  \n \nData from two randomised controlled clinical trials conducted with insulin aspart (322 + 27 exposed \npregnancies) do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin aspart on pregnancy or on the health of the \nfoetus/new born when compared to soluble human insulin. \n \nIntensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes (type 1 diabetes, \ntype 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes) are recommended throughout pregnancy and when \ncontemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase \nsubsequently during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally \nreturn rapidly to pre-pregnancy values.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breast-feeding. Insulin treatment of the \nnursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the dosage may need to be adjusted. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human \ninsulin regarding fertility.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patientâ€™s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g., driving a car or \nusing machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is \nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia (see section \nâ€˜Description of selected adverse reactionsâ€™ below). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions listed below (Table 2) are based on data from 6 completed therapeutic confirmatory \ntrials in adults. Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention: Very common \n(â‰¥ 1/10); common (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (â‰¥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (â‰¥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 2 Adverse reactions from clinical trials \n\nMedDRA System Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic \nreactions \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nHypoglycaemia    \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Allergic skin \nmanifestations \n\nLipodystrophy  \n\n\n\n9 \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n \nInjection/infus\nion site \nreactions \n\n \n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic skin manifestations reported with Fiasp (1.8% vs. 1.5% for comparator) include eczema, rash, \nrash pruritic, urticaria and dermatitis. \n \nWith Fiasp generalised hypersensitivity reactions (manifested by generalised skin rash and facial \noedema) was reported uncommonly (0.2% vs. 0.3% for comparator).  \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe \nhypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or \npermanent impairment of brain function or even death. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur \nsuddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, \nunusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, \nvision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Hypoglycaemia may occur \nearlier after an injection/infusion of Fiasp compared to other mealtime insulins due to the earlier onset \nof action. \n \nLipodystrophy \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) was reported at the injection/infusion site in \npatients treated with Fiasp (0.5% vs. 0.2% in comparator). Continuous rotation of the injection site \nwithin the particular injection area may help to reduce the risk of developing these reactions.  \n \nInjection/infusion site reactions \nInjection site reactions (including rash, redness, inflammation, pain and bruising) were reported in \npatients treated with Fiasp (1.3% vs. 1.0% in comparator). In patients using CSII (N=261): Infusion \nsite reactions (including redness, inflammation, irritation, pain, bruising and itching) were reported in \npatients treated with Fiasp (10.0% vs. 8.3% in comparator). These reactions are usually mild and \ntransitory and they normally disappear during continued treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety and efficacy have been investigated in a therapeutic confirmatory trial in children with type 1 \ndiabetes aged 2 to less than 18 years. In the trial, 519 patients were treated with Fiasp. Overall the \nfrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in the paediatric population do not indicate \ndifferences to the experience in the adult population. Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, \nlipoatrophy) at the injection site was reported more often in this study with paediatric patients \ncompared to studies in adults (see above). In the paediatric population lipodystrophy was reported \nwith a frequency of 2.1% for Fiasp vs. 1.6% for NovoRapid.  \n \nOther special populations \n \nBased on results from clinical trials with insulin aspart in general, the frequency, type and severity of \nadverse reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not \nindicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population. The safety profile in very \nelderly patients (â‰¥ 75 years) or patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic \nimpairment is limited. Fiasp has been administered to elderly patients for the investigation of \npharmacokinetic properties (see section 5.2).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nA specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages if a patient is dosed with more insulin than required: \n \nâ€¢ Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or other products \n\ncontaining sugar. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries glucose-\ncontaining products. \n\n \nâ€¢ Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient is not able to treat him/herself, can be treated \n\nwith glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or \nwith glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given \nintravenously if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon \nregaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in \norder to prevent a relapse. \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting \nATC code: A10AB05. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFiasp is a fast-acting insulin aspart formulation. \nThe primary activity of Fiasp is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin \naspart, the active ingredient in Fiasp, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. \nReceptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose by facilitating cellular uptake of glucose into skeletal \nmuscle and adipose tissue and by inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver. Insulin inhibits \nlipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nFiasp is a mealtime insulin aspart formulation in which the addition of nicotinamide (vitamin B3) \nresults in a faster initial absorption of insulin compared to NovoRapid. \n \nThe onset of action was 5 minutes earlier and time to maximum glucose infusion rate was 11 minutes \nearlier with Fiasp than with NovoRapid. The maximum glucose-lowering effect of Fiasp occurred \nbetween 1 and 3 hours after injection. The glucose-lowering effect during the first 30 minutes \n(AUCGIR, 0â€“30 min ) was 51 mg/kg with Fiasp and 29 mg/kg with NovoRapid (Fiasp/NovoRapid ratio: \n1.74 [1.47;2.10]95% CI). The total glucose-lowering effect and maximum (GIRmax) glucose-lowering \neffect were comparable between Fiasp and NovoRapid. Total and maximum glucose-lowering effect \nof Fiasp increase linearly with increasing dose within the therapeutic dose range. \n \nFiasp has an earlier onset of action compared to NovoRapid (see section 5.2), leading to a subsequent \nincreased glucose-lowering effect. This must be considered when prescribing Fiasp. \n \nThe duration of action was shorter for Fiasp compared to that of NovoRapid and lasted for 3â€“5 hours. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nThe day-to-day variability within-patients in glucose-lowering effect was low for Fiasp both for early \n(AUCGIR, 0-1h, CV~26%), total (AUCGIR, 0-12h, CV~18%) and maximum glucose-lowering effect \n(GIRmax, CV~19%). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nFiasp has been studied in 2,068 adult patients with type 1 diabetes (1,143 patients) and type 2 diabetes \n(925 patients) in 3 randomised efficacy and safety trials (18â€“26 weeks of treatment). Furthermore, \nFiasp has been studied in 777 paediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes in a randomised efficacy and \nsafety trial (26 weeks of treatment). No children below the age of 2 years were randomised in the trial. \n \nPatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus \nThe treatment effect of Fiasp in achieving glycaemic control was assessed when administered at \nmealtime or postmeal. Fiasp administered at mealtime was non-inferior to NovoRapid in reducing \nHbA1c, and the improvement in HbA1c was statistically significant in favour of Fiasp. Fiasp \nadministered postmeal achieved similar HbA1c reduction as NovoRapid dosed at mealtime (Table 3). \n \nTable 3 Results from 26 week basal-bolus clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes \n Fiasp mealtime \n\n+ insulin detemir \nFiasp postmeal \n\n+ insulin detemir \nNovoRapid \nmealtime \n\n+ insulin detemir \n\nN 381 382 380 \n\nHbA1c (%)    \nBaseline ï‚ž End of trial 7.6 ï‚ž 7.3  7.6 ï‚ž 7.5 7.6 ï‚ž 7.4 \nAdjusted change from baseline  -0.32 -0.13 -0.17 \nEstimated treatment difference -0.15 [-0.23;-0.07]CE 0.04 [-0.04;0.12]D  \nHbA1c (mmol/mol)    \nBaseline ï‚ž End of trial 59.7 ï‚ž 56.4 59.9 ï‚ž 58.6 59.3 ï‚ž 57.6 \nAdjusted change from baseline  -3.46 -1.37 -1.84 \nEstimated treatment difference -1.62 [-2.50;-0.73]CE 0.47[-0.41;1.36]D  \n2-hour postmeal glucose increment \n(mmol/L)A \n\n   \n\nBaseline ï‚ž End of trial 6.1 ï‚ž 5.9 6.1 ï‚ž 6.7  6.2 ï‚ž 6.6 \nAdjusted change from baseline  -0.29 0.67 0.38 \nEstimated treatment difference -0.67 [-1.29;-0.04]CE 0.30 [-0.34;0.93]D  \n1-hour postmeal glucose increment \n(mmol/L)A \n\n   \n\nBaseline ï‚ž End of trial 5.4 ï‚ž 4.7 5.4 ï‚ž 6.6 5.7 ï‚ž 5.9 \nAdjusted change from baseline  -0.84 1.27 0.34 \nEstimated treatment difference -1.18[-1.65;-0.71]CE 0.93[0.46;1.40]D  \nBodyweight (kg)    \nBaseline ï‚ž End of trial 78.6 ï‚ž 79.2 80.5 ï‚ž 81.2 80.2 ï‚ž 80.7 \nAdjusted change from baseline  0.67 0.70 0.55 \nEstimated treatment difference 0.12 [-0.30;0.55]C 0.16 [-0.27;0.58]D  \nObserved rate of severe or BG \nconfirmed hypoglycaemiaB per \npatient year of exposure (percentage \nof patients) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n59.0 (92.7) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n54.4 (95.0) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n58.7 (97.4) \nEstimated rate ratio 1.01 [0.88;1.15]C 0.92 [0.81;1.06]D  \nBaseline, End of trial values are based on the mean of the observed last available values.

No overall \ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients. \n \nContinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)  \nA 6-week, randomised (2:1), double-blind, parallel-group, active controlled trial evaluated \ncompatibility of Fiasp and NovoRapid administered via CSII system in adult patients with type 1 \ndiabetes. There were no microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion set occlusions in either the \nFiasp (N=25) or NovoRapid (N=12) groups. There were two patients from the Fiasp group who each \nreported two treatment-emergent infusion site reactions. \n \nIn a 2-week cross-over trial, Fiasp showed a greater postmeal glucose-lowering effect after a \nstandardised meal test with regard to 1-hour and 2-hour postmeal glucose response (treatment \ndifference: -0.50 mmol/L [-1.07; 0.07]95% CI and -0.99 mmol/L [-1.95; -0.03]95% CI), respectively \ncompared to NovoRapid in a CSII setting. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy and safety of Fiasp have been studied in a 1:1:1 randomised active controlled clinical trial \nin children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, aged 1 to 18 years, for a period of 26 weeks (N=777). \nIn this trial the efficacy and safety of Fiasp administered at mealtime (0â€“2 minutes before meal) or \npostmeal (20 minutes after meal start) and NovoRapid administered at mealtime, both used in \ncombination with insulin degludec, were compared. \nPatients in the Fiasp mealtime arm included 16 children aged 2â€“5 years, 100 children aged 6â€“11 years \nand 144 adolescents aged 12â€“17 years. Patients in the Fiasp postmeal arm included 16 children aged \n2â€“5 years, 100 children aged 6â€“11 years and 143 adolescents aged 12â€“17 years. \nFiasp administered at mealtime showed superior glycaemic control compared to NovoRapid mealtime \nwith regards to change in HbA1c (ETD: -0.17% [-0.30; -0.03]95% CI). Fiasp administered postmeal \nshowed non-inferior glycaemic control compared to NovoRapid mealtime (ETD: 0.13% [-0.01; \n0.26]95% CI). \nFiasp mealtime showed a statistically significant improvement in 1â€“ hour postmeal glucose increment \nmean over all three main meals compared to NovoRapid (measured by SMPG). For Fiasp postmeal \nthis comparison favoured NovoRapid mealtime.  \nNo overall increased risk of severe or blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemia was observed \ncompared to NovoRapid. \nThe observed effects and the safety profiles were comparable between all age groups. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFiasp is a mealtime insulin aspart formulation in which the addition of nicotinamide (vitamin B3) \nresults in a faster initial absorption of insulin. Insulin appeared in the circulation approximately \n4 minutes after administration (Figure 1). The onset of appearance was twice as fast (corresponding to \n5 minutes earlier), time to 50% maximum concentration was 9 minutes shorter with Fiasp compared to \nNovoRapid with four times as much insulin available during first 15 minutes and with twice as much \ninsulin available during the first 30 minutes. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nFiasp \nNovoRapid \n\nIn\nsu\n\nlin\n a\n\nsp\nar\n\nt c\non\n\nce\nnt\n\nra\ntio\n\nn \n(p\n\nm\nol\n\n/L\n) \n\nTime (min)  \nFigure 1 Mean insulin profile in patients with type 1 diabetes after subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\n \nThe total insulin exposure was comparable between Fiasp and NovoRapid. The mean Cmax for a dose \nof 0.2 units/kg body weight is 298 pmol/L and comparable to NovoRapid. \n \nTotal exposure and maximum insulin concentration increases proportionally with increasing \nsubcutaneous dose of Fiasp within the therapeutic dose range. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of insulin aspart after subcutaneous administration of Fiasp in the \nabdomen, deltoid and thigh was approximately 80%. \n \nAfter administration of Fiasp, the fast onset of appearance is maintained regardless of injection site. \nTime to maximum concentration and total insulin aspart exposure were all comparable between the \nabdomen, upper arm and the thigh. Early insulin exposure and maximum concentration were \ncomparable for the abdomen and upper arm regions, but lower for the thigh. \n \nContinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) \n \nThe onset of exposure in a CSII setting (time to reach maximum concentration) was 26 minutes \nshorter with Fiasp compared to NovoRapid resulting in approximately three times as much insulin \navailable during the first 30 minutes (Figure 2). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nIn\nsu\n\nlin\n a\n\nsp\nar\n\nt c\non\n\nce\nnt\n\nra\ntio\n\nn \nba\n\nse\nlin\n\ne-\nad\n\nju\nst\n\ned\n (p\n\nm\nol\n\n/L\n) \n\nFiasp \nNovoRapid \n\nTime since bolus injection (min) \n \n\nFigure 2 Mean insulin profiles in patients with type 1 diabetes in a CSII setting (0â€“5 hours) \ncorrected for basal insulin infusion \n\n \nDistribution \n \nInsulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (< 10%), similar to that seen with regular \nhuman insulin. \n \nVolume of distribution (Vd) after intravenous administration was 0.22 L/kg (e.g., 15.4 L for a 70 kg \nsubject) corresponding to the extracellular fluid volume in the body. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDegradation of insulin aspart is similar to that of human insulin; all metabolites formed are inactive. \n \nElimination \n \nHalf-life after subcutaneous administration of Fiasp is 57 minutes and comparable to NovoRapid. \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of Fiasp, clearance was rapid (1.0 L/h/kg) and the elimination \nhalf-life was 10 minutes. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nIn elderly patients with type 1 diabetes Fiasp showed, an earlier onset of exposure and a higher early \ninsulin exposure whilst maintaining a similar total exposure and maximum concentration compared to \nNovoRapid. \n \nTotal insulin aspart exposure and maximum concentration following administration of Fiasp was 30% \nhigher in elderly subjects compared to younger adult subjects.  \n \nGender  \nThe effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of Fiasp was examined in an across-trial analysis of the \npharmacokinetic studies. Fiasp showed a comparable earlier onset of exposure and a higher early \n\n\n\n16 \n\ninsulin exposure whilst maintaining a similar total exposure and maximum concentration compared to \nNovoRapid for both females and male patients with type 1 diabetes. \n \nThe early and maximum insulin exposure of Fiasp was comparable for female and male patients with \ntype 1 diabetes. However, total insulin exposure was larger in female compared to male patients with \ntype 1 diabetes. \n \nObesity  \nThe initial absorption rate was slower with increasing BMI while the total exposure was similar across \ndifferent BMI levels. Compared to NovoRapid, the influence of BMI on the absorption was less \npronounced for Fiasp leading to relatively higher initial exposure. \n \nRace and Ethnicity \nThe effect of race and ethnicity (Blacks vs. Whites and Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics) on the total \ninsulin exposure of Fiasp was based on results from a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients \nwith type 1 diabetes. For Fiasp no difference in exposure was found between the racial and ethnic \ngroups investigated. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA single dose pharmacokinetic study of insulin aspart was performed with NovoRapid in 24 subjects \nwith hepatic function ranging from normal to severely impaired. In subjects with hepatic impairment, \nabsorption rate was decreased and more variable. \n \nRenal impairment \nA single dose pharmacokinetic study of insulin aspart was performed with NovoRapid in 18 subjects \nwith renal function ranging from normal to severely impaired. No apparent effect of creatinine \nclearance values on AUC, Cmax, CL/F and Tmax of insulin aspart was found. Data were limited in \npatients with moderate and severe renal impairment. Patients with renal failure necessitating dialysis \ntreatment were not investigated. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn children (6â€“11 years) and adolescents (12â€“18 years) Fiasp showed, an earlier onset of exposure and \na higher early insulin exposure whilst maintaining a similar total exposure and maximum \nconcentration compared to NovoRapid. \n \nOnset and early insulin exposure of Fiasp was similar in children and adolescents to that in adults. \nTotal exposure of Fiasp was lower in children and adolescents compared to adults when dosed with \n0.2 units/kg body weight, while the maximum serum insulin aspart concentration was similar between \nage groups. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction after exposure to \ninsulin aspart. In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin and IGF-1 receptor sites and effects on cell \ngrowth, insulin aspart behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also \ndemonstrate that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin aspart is equivalent to \nhuman insulin. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nFiasp 100 units/mL FlexTouch solution for injection in pre-filled pen \ninsulin aspart \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \nâ€“ Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \nâ€“ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \nâ€“ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \nâ€“ If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1 What Fiasp is and what it is used for \n2 What you need to know before you use Fiasp \n3 How to use Fiasp \n4 Possible side effects \n5 How to store Fiasp \n6 Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fiasp is and what it is used for \n \nFiasp is a mealtime insulin with a fast-acting blood sugar lowering effect. Fiasp is a solution for \ninjection containing insulin aspart and is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and \nchildren aged 1 year and above. Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough \ninsulin to control the level of blood sugar. Treatment with Fiasp helps to prevent complications from \nyour diabetes. \n \nFiasp should be injected up to 2 minutes before the start of the meal, with an option to inject up to \n20 minutes after starting the meal. \n \nThis medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for \n3 to 5 hours.  \n \nThis medicine should normally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin \npreparations. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fiasp \n \nDo not use Fiasp \nâ€¢ if you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fiasp. Be especially aware of the following: \nâ€¢ Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low \n\nblood sugar in section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™. Fiasp starts to lower blood sugar faster \ncompared to other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier \nafter an injection with Fiasp.  \n\n\n\n53 \n\nâ€¢ High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for \nhigh blood sugar in section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™.  \n\nâ€¢ Switching from other insulin medicinal products - The insulin dose may need to be changed if \nyou switch from another insulin.  \n\nâ€¢ Pioglitazone used together with insulin - This may increase the risk of heart failure, see under \nâ€˜Other medicines and Fiaspâ€™ below.  \n\nâ€¢ Eye disorder - Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of \ndiabetic eye disorder.  \n\nâ€¢ Pain due to nerve damage - If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may get nerve \nrelated pain, this is usually temporary. \n\nâ€¢ Swelling around your joints - When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep \nmore water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is \nusually only short-lasting. \n\n \nIf you have poor eyesight, please see section 3 â€˜How to use Fiaspâ€™.  \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect how much insulin you need. Talk to your doctor: \nâ€¢ if you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \nâ€¢ if you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level.  \nâ€¢ if you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and talk to your doctor.  \n \nWhen using Fiasp it is strongly recommended that the name and batch number of each package is \nrecorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nThis medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year.  \n \nOther medicines and Fiasp \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to \nchange.  \n \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  \nâ€¢ sulphonamides - for infections  \nâ€¢ anabolic steroids - such as testosterone  \nâ€¢ beta-blockers - for e.g., high blood pressure or angina. They may make it harder to recognise the \n\nwarning signs of low blood sugar (see section 4 â€˜Warning signs of low blood sugarâ€™)  \nâ€¢ acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates) - for pain and mild fever  \nâ€¢ monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors - for depression  \nâ€¢ angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors - for some heart problems or high blood \n\npressure.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ danazol - for endometriosis  \nâ€¢ oral contraceptives (birth control pills)  \nâ€¢ thyroid hormones - for thyroid problems  \nâ€¢ growth hormone - for growth hormone deficiency  \nâ€¢ glucocorticoids such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ - for inflammation  \nâ€¢ sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline - for asthma  \nâ€¢ thiazides - for high blood pressure or if your body is keeping too much water (water retention).  \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide - used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone \n(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \nPioglitazone - oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. Some patients with long-\nstanding type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and \ninsulin developed heart failure. Tell your doctor immediately if you have signs of heart failure such as \nunusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).  \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nFiasp with alcohol  \nIf you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or \nfall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. This medicine can be used during pregnancy; however your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is \nneeded in pregnancy. Avoiding low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the \nhealth of your baby.  \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nHaving low blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your blood \nsugar is low, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be dangerous to \nyourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if:  \nâ€¢ you often get low blood sugar \nâ€¢ you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Fiasp \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that this medicine is \nessentially â€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use Fiasp \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nIf you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen \nwithout help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch pre-filled \npen.  \n \nThe pre-filled pen can provide a dose of 1â€“80 units in one injection in steps of 1 unit.  \n \nWhen to use Fiasp \nFiasp is a mealtime insulin.  \n \nAdults: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with an option to \ninject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. \nChildren: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with the possibility \nto inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal in situations, when there is uncertainty about how the \nchild will eat. Ask your doctor for advice on these situations. \n \nThis medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for \n3 to 5 hours.  \n \nFiasp dose \n\n\n\n55 \n\nDose for type 1 and type 2 diabetes  \nYour doctor will decide together with you:  \nâ€¢ how much Fiasp you will need at each meal \nâ€¢ when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose.  \n \nIf you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a change in \ndiet may alter your need for insulin.  \n \nWhen using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  \n \nDose adjustment for type 2 diabetes \nThe daily dose should be based on your blood sugar level at mealtimes and bedtime from the previous \nday. \nâ€¢ Before breakfast - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before lunch the \n\nprevious day. \nâ€¢ Before lunch - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before dinner the \n\nprevious day. \nâ€¢ Before dinner - dose should be adjusted according to the bedtime blood sugar level the previous \n\nday. \n \n\nTable 1 Dose adjustment \nMealtime or bedtime blood sugar Dose adjustment \n\n mmol/L mg/dL \nless than 4.0 less than 71 Reduce dose by 1 unit \n\n4.0â€“6.0 71â€“108 No dose adjustment \nmore than 6.0 more than 108 Increase dose by 1 unit \n\n \nUse in elderly patients (65 years or older)  \nThis medicine can be used in elderly patients. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose.  \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems  \nIf you have kidney or liver problems you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk \nto your doctor about changes in your dose.  \n \nInjecting Fiasp \nThis medicine is only suitable for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection).  \nBefore you use Fiasp for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the pre-filled \npen. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWhere to inject \nâ€¢ The best places to inject are the front of your waist (abdomen) or upper arms. \nâ€¢ Do not inject into a vein or muscle.  \nâ€¢ Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing \n\nchanges under the skin (see section 4).  \n \nDo not use Fiasp \nâ€¢ if the pen is damaged or if it has not been stored correctly (see section 5 â€˜How to store Fiaspâ€™).  \nâ€¢ if the insulin does not appear clear (e.g., cloudy) and colourless.  \n \nDetailed instructions for use are provided on the other side of this leaflet.  \n \nIf you use more Fiasp than you should  \nIf you use too much insulin your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section \n4 under â€˜Low blood sugarâ€™. \n \nIf you forget to use Fiasp \n\n\n\n56 \n\nIf you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See section 4 \nunder â€˜High blood sugarâ€™. \n \nThree simple steps that may help avoiding low or high blood sugar are:  \nâ€¢ Always keep a spare pen in case you lose your pen or it gets damaged. \nâ€¢ Always carry something to show you have diabetes.  \nâ€¢ Always carry products containing sugar with you. See section 4 under â€˜What to do if you get \n\nlow blood sugarâ€™. \n \nIf you stop using Fiasp \nDo not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin this could \nlead to a very high blood sugar level (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (a condition with too \nmuch acid in the blood which is potentially life-threatening). See symptoms and advice in section 4 \nunder â€˜High blood sugarâ€™. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become \nunconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you \nhave symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See \nadvice in â€˜Low blood sugarâ€™ below. \n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Fiasp, stop using this \nmedicine and contact emergency medical service straight away.  \n \nSigns of a serious allergic reaction may include:  \nâ€¢ local reactions (e.g., rash, redness and itching) spread to other parts of your body  \nâ€¢ you suddenly feel unwell with sweating  \nâ€¢ you start being sick (vomiting)  \nâ€¢ you experience difficulty in breathing  \nâ€¢ you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy.  \n \nAllergic reactions such as generalised skin rash and facial swelling may occur. These are uncommon \nand may affect up to 1 in 100 people. See a doctor if the symptoms worsen or you see no improvement \nin a few weeks. \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  \nReaction at administration site: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs \nmay include: rash, redness, inflammation, bruising, irritation, pain and itching. The reactions usually \ndisappear after a few days. \nSkin reactions: Signs of allergy on the skin such as eczema, rash, itching, hives and dermatitis may \noccur. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)  \nChanges under the skin where you use the injection (lipodystrophy): Fatty tissue under the skin may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or get thicker (lipohypertrophy). Changing where you inject each time may \nreduce the risk of developing these skin changes. If you notice these skin changes, tell your doctor or \nnurse. If you keep injecting in the same place, these reactions can become more severe and affect the \namount of medicine your body gets. \n \nGeneral effects from insulin treatment including Fiasp  \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \nâ€¢ Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common) \n \nLow blood sugar may happen if you:  \nDrink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal.  \n \nWarning signs of low blood sugar â€“ these may come on suddenly:  \nâ€¢ headache \nâ€¢ slurred speech \nâ€¢ fast heartbeat \nâ€¢ cold sweat \nâ€¢ cool pale skin \nâ€¢ feeling sick \nâ€¢ feeling very hungry \nâ€¢ tremor or feeling nervous or worried \nâ€¢ feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy \nâ€¢ feeling confused \nâ€¢ difficulty in concentrating \nâ€¢ short-lasting changes in your sight.  \n \nWhat to do if you get low blood sugar  \nâ€¢ If you are conscious, treat your low blood sugar immediately with 15â€“20 g of fast-acting \n\ncarbohydrate: eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like fruit juice, sweets or biscuits \n(always carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case).  \n\nâ€¢ It is recommended that you retest your blood glucose levels after 15â€“20 minutes and re-treat if \nyour blood glucose levels are still less than 4 mmol/L. \n\nâ€¢ Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. \nThen carry on with your insulin treatment as usual.  \n\n \nWhat others need to do if you pass out  \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out.  \n \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must:  \nâ€¢ turn you on your side to avoid choking \nâ€¢ get medical help straight away  \nâ€¢ not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  \n \nYou may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given \nby someone who knows how to use it.  \nâ€¢ If you are given glucagon you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round.  \nâ€¢ If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital.  \n \nIf severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short or \nlong-lasting. It may even cause death. \n \nTalk to your doctor if:  \nâ€¢ your blood sugar got so low that you passed out  \nâ€¢ you have been given an injection of glucagon \nâ€¢ you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently.  \nThis is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be \nchanged.  \n \nâ€¢ High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data) \n \nHigh blood sugar may happen if you:  \n\n\n\n58 \n\nEat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough \ninsulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin. \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar â€“ these normally appear gradually:  \nâ€¢ flushed skin \nâ€¢ dry skin \nâ€¢ feeling sleepy or tired \nâ€¢ dry mouth \nâ€¢ fruity (acetone) breath \nâ€¢ urinating more often \nâ€¢ feeling thirsty \nâ€¢ losing your appetite \nâ€¢ feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting).  \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the \nblood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic \ncoma and eventually death.  \n \nWhat to do if you get high blood sugar  \nâ€¢ Test your blood sugar level.  \nâ€¢ Give a correction dose of insulin if you have been taught how to do this. \nâ€¢ Test your urine for ketones.  \nâ€¢ If you have ketones, seek medical help straight away.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.  \n \n \n5. How to store Fiasp \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton, after â€˜EXPâ€™. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nBefore first use:  \nStore in a refrigerator (2Â°Câ€“8Â°C). Do not freeze. Keep away from the freezing element.

Not all pack sizes may be \nmarketed. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \nNovo Nordisk A/S,  \nNovo AllÃ©,  \nDK-2880 BagsvÃ¦rd, Denmark \n \nNow turn over for information on how to use your FlexTouch. \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nOther sources of information \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n60 \n\nInstructions on how to use Fiasp FlexTouch \n \n\nPlease read these instructions carefully before using your FlexTouch pre-filled pen. If you do not \nfollow the instructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to high or \nlow blood sugar level. \n \nDo not use the pen without proper training from your doctor or nurse. \nStart by checking your pen to make sure that it contains Fiasp 100 units/mL, then look at the \nillustrations below to get to know the different parts of your pen and needle. \n \nIf you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use \nthis pen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch \npre-filled pen. \n \nYour pen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen containing 300 units of insulin. You can select a \nmaximum of 80 units per dose, in steps of 1 unit. Your pen is designed to be used with NovoTwist, \nNovoFine or NovoFine Plus single-use, disposable needles up to a length of 8 mm. Needles are not \nincluded in the pack. \n \n\n Important information \nPay special attention to these notes as they are important for correct use of the pen. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \nFiasp pre-filled pen and \nneedle (example) \n(FlexTouch) \n\nOuter  \nneedle cap Pen cap \n\nNeedle \n\nPaper tab \n\nInsulin scale \n\nInsulin window \n\nPen label \n\nDose counter \n\nDose pointer \n\nDose \nselector \n\nDose \nbutton \n\nInner \nneedle cap \n\nFlexTouch\n \n\nDose  \nbutton \nwith  \ntwo lines \n\n \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\n1 Prepare your pen with a new needle \n \nâ€¢ Check the name and strength on the label of your pen, to make sure that it contains Fiasp \n\n100 units/mL. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take \na wrong type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. \n\n \nâ€¢ Pull off the pen cap. \n \n A \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Check that the insulin in your pen is clear and colourless. \n Look through the insulin window. If the insulin looks cloudy, do not use the pen. \n \n B \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab. \n \n C \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn until it is on tight. \n \n D \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it after the injection, to \n\nsafely remove the needle from the pen. \n \n E \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it back on, you may \n\naccidentally prick or injure yourself with the needle. \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nA drop of insulin may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the insulin \nflow. \n \nDo not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready for your injection. \n \n F \n\n \n \n\n Always use a new needle for each injection. \nThis reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate \ndosing. \n \n\n Never use a bent or damaged needle. \n \n \n2 Check the insulin flow \n \nâ€¢ Always check the insulin flow before you start. \n This helps you to ensure that you get your full insulin dose. \n \nâ€¢ Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. Make sure the dose counter shows 2. \n \n A \n\n2 units \nselected \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. \n Tap the top of the pen gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. \n \n B \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. \n The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \n A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. \n \n C \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \nA small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. \n \nIf no drop appears, repeat steps 2A to 2C up to 6 times. If there is still no drop, change the needle \nand repeat steps 2A to 2C once more. \n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a new one. \n \n\n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure \nthat the insulin is flowing properly. \n\n \nIf no drop appears, no insulin will be injected, even though the dose counter may move. This \nmay indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n\n \n Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little \n\ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to high blood sugar level. \n \n \n3 Select your dose \n \nâ€¢ Make sure the dose counter shows 0 before you start. \n The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \n \nâ€¢ Turn the dose selector to select the dose you need, as directed by your doctor or nurse. \n \n\nIf you select a wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forwards or backwards to the correct \ndose. \n\n \n The pen can dial up to a maximum of 80 units. \n \n A \n\nExamples \n\n24 units \nselected \n\n5 units \nselected \n\n \n \n\nThe dose selector changes the number of units. Only the dose counter and dose pointer will \nshow how many units you select per dose. \n \nYou can select up to 80 units per dose. When your pen contains less than 80 units, the dose \ncounter stops at the number of units left. \n\n \n Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many units you have selected \n\nbefore injecting the insulin. \nDo not count the pen clicks to set the dose. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood \nsugar level may get too high or too low.  \n\n Do not use the insulin scale, it only shows approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \nThe dose selector clicks differently when turned forwards, backwards or past the number of \nunits left. \n\n \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n4 Inject your dose \n \nâ€¢ Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. \n \nâ€¢ Make sure you can see the dose counter. \n Do not touch the dose counter with your fingers. This could interrupt the injection. \n \n A \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows 0. \n The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a click. \n \n B \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Keep the needle in your skin after the dose counter has returned to 0 and count slowly to 6. \nâ€¢ If the needle is removed earlier, you may see a stream of insulin coming from the needle tip. If \n\nso, the full dose will not be delivered, and you should increase the frequency of checking your \nblood sugar level. \n\n \n C Count slowly: \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Remove the needle from your skin. If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly on the \n\nskin for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. Do not rub the area. \n \n D \n\n \n \n\nYou may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect \nyour dose. \n\n \n Always watch the dose counter to know how many units you inject. Hold the dose button \n\ndown until the dose counter shows 0. If the dose counter does not return to 0, the full dose has \nnot been delivered, which may lead to high blood sugar level.  \n\n \nHow to identify a blocked or damaged needle?  \nâ€¢ If 0 does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, you may \n\nhave used a blocked or damaged needle.  \n\n\n\n66 \n\nâ€¢ In this case - you have not received any medicine - even though the dose counter has moved \nfrom the original dose that you have set.  \n\n \nHow to handle a blocked needle? \nRemove the needle as described in section 5 and repeat all steps starting with section 1: Prepare your \npen with a new needle. Make sure you select the full dose you need.  \n \nNever touch the dose counter when you inject.  \nThis can interrupt the injection. \n \n \n5 After your injection \n \nâ€¢ Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without touching the needle or \n\nthe outer cap. \n \n A \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap completely on. \n \nâ€¢ Unscrew the needle and dispose of it as instructed by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local \nauthorities. \n \n B \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the insulin from light. \n \n C \n\n \n \n\nAlways dispose of the needle after each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, \ninfection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. If the needle is blocked, \nyou will not inject any insulin. \n \nWhen the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed by your doctor, nurse, \npharmacist or local authorities. \n\n \n Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may prick or injure yourself \n\nwith the needle. \n \n\n Always remove the needle from your pen after each injection and store your pen without the \nneedle attached. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked \nneedles and inaccurate dosing. \n\n  \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\n6 How much insulin is left? \n \nâ€¢ The insulin scale shows you approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \n \n A \n\nApprox. \nhow much \n\ninsulin is \nleft \n\n \n \nâ€¢ To see precisely how much insulin is left, use the dose counter: \n Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. \n If it shows 80, at least 80 units are left in your pen. \n If it shows less than 80, the number shown is the number of units left in your pen. \n \n B \n\nDose \ncounter \n\nstopped: \n16 units \n\nleft \n\nExample \n\n \n \nâ€¢ Turn the dose selector back until the dose counter shows 0. \n \nâ€¢ If you need more insulin than the units left in your pen, you can split your dose between two \n\npens. \n \n\n Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose. \nIf in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose wrong, you will inject too \nlittle or too much insulin, which can lead to high or low blood sugar levels. \n\n \n \n\n Further important information \n \nâ€¢ Always keep your pen with you. \n \nâ€¢ Always carry an extra pen and new needles with you, in case of loss or damage. \n \nâ€¢ Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n \nâ€¢ Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n \nâ€¢ Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to them. \n \nâ€¢ Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles â€“ to reduce the risk of needle \n\ninjury and cross-infection. \n \nCaring for your pen \n \nâ€¢ Treat your pen with care. Rough handling or misuse may cause inaccurate dosing, which can \n\nlead to high or low blood sugar levels. \n \nâ€¢ Do not leave the pen in a car or other place where it can get too hot or too cold. \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nâ€¢ Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt or liquid. \n \nâ€¢ Do not wash, soak or lubricate your pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a \n\nmoistened cloth. \n \nâ€¢ Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. \n\nIf you drop it or suspect a problem, attach a new needle and check the insulin flow before you \ninject. \n\n \nâ€¢ Do not try to refill your pen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n \nâ€¢ Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nFiasp 100 units/mL Penfill solution for injection in cartridge \ninsulin aspart \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

What Fiasp is and what it is used for \n \nFiasp is a mealtime insulin with a fast-acting blood sugar lowering effect. Fiasp is a solution for \ninjection containing insulin aspart and is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and \nchildren aged 1 year and above. Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough \ninsulin to control the level of blood sugar. Treatment with Fiasp helps to prevent complications from \nyour diabetes.  \n \nFiasp should be injected up to 2 minutes before the start of the meal, with an option to inject up to \n20 minutes after starting the meal. \n \nThis medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for \n3 to 5 hours. \n \nThis medicine should normally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin \npreparations. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fiasp \n \nDo not use Fiasp \nâ€¢ if you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fiasp. Be especially aware of the following: \nâ€¢ Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low \n\nblood sugar in section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™. Fiasp starts to lower blood sugar faster \ncompared to other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier \nafter an injection with Fiasp.  \n\n\n\n70 \n\nâ€¢ High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for \nhigh blood sugar in section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™.  \n\nâ€¢ Switching from other insulin medicinal products - The insulin dose may need to be changed if \nyou switch from another insulin.  \n\nâ€¢ Pioglitazone used together with insulin - This may increase the risk of heart failure, see under \nâ€˜Other medicines and Fiaspâ€™ below.  \n\nâ€¢ Eye disorder - Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of \ndiabetic eye disorder.  \n\nâ€¢ Pain due to nerve damage - If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may get nerve \nrelated pain, this is usually temporary. \n\nâ€¢ Swelling around your joints - When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep \nmore water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is \nusually only short-lasting. \n\n \nIf you have poor eyesight, please see section 3 â€˜How to use Fiaspâ€™.  \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect how much insulin you need. Talk to your doctor: \nâ€¢ if you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \nâ€¢ if you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level.  \nâ€¢ if you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and talk to your doctor.  \n \nWhen using Fiasp it is strongly recommended that the name and batch number of each package is \nrecorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nThis medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year.  \n \nOther medicines and Fiasp \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to \nchange.  \n \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  \nâ€¢ sulphonamides - for infections  \nâ€¢ anabolic steroids - such as testosterone  \nâ€¢ beta-blockers - for e.g., high blood pressure or angina. They may make it harder to recognise the \n\nwarning signs of low blood sugar (see section 4 â€˜Warning signs of low blood sugarâ€™)  \nâ€¢ acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates) - for pain and mild fever  \nâ€¢ monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors - for depression  \nâ€¢ angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors - for some heart problems or high blood \n\npressure.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ danazol - for endometriosis  \nâ€¢ oral contraceptives (birth control pills)  \nâ€¢ thyroid hormones - for thyroid problems \nâ€¢ growth hormone - for growth hormone deficiency  \nâ€¢ glucocorticoids such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ - for inflammation  \nâ€¢ sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline - for asthma  \nâ€¢ thiazides - for high blood pressure or if your body is keeping too much water (water retention).  \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide - used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone \n(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \nPioglitazone - oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. Some patients with long-\nstanding type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and \ninsulin developed heart failure. Tell your doctor immediately if you have signs of heart failure such as \nunusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).  \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nFiasp with alcohol  \nIf you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or \nfall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. This medicine can be used during pregnancy; however your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is \nneeded in pregnancy. Avoiding low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the \nhealth of your baby.  \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breastâ€“feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nHaving low blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your blood \nsugar is low, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be dangerous to \nyourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if:  \nâ€¢ you often get low blood sugar \nâ€¢ you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Fiasp \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that this medicine is \nessentially â€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use Fiasp \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nIf you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this \ninsulin medicinal product without any help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained \nto use the pen.  \n \nWhen to use Fiasp \nFiasp is a mealtime insulin.  \n \nAdults: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with an option to \ninject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. \nChildren: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with the possibility \nto inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal in situations, when there is uncertainty about how the \nchild will eat. Ask your doctor for advice on these situations. \n \nThis medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for \n3 to 5 hours.  \n \nFiasp dose \nDose for type 1 and type 2 diabetes  \nYour doctor will decide together with you:  \n\n\n\n72 \n\nâ€¢ how much Fiasp you will need at each meal \nâ€¢ when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose.  \n \nIf you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a change in \ndiet may alter your need for insulin.  \n \nWhen using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  \n \nDose adjustment for type 2 diabetes \nThe daily dose should be based on your blood sugar level at mealtimes and bedtime from the previous \nday. \nâ€¢ Before breakfast - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before lunch the \n\nprevious day. \nâ€¢ Before lunch - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before dinner the \n\nprevious day. \nâ€¢ Before dinner - dose should be adjusted according to the bedtime blood sugar level the previous \n\nday. \n \n\nTable 1 Dose adjustment \nMealtime or bedtime blood sugar Dose adjustment \n\n mmol/L mg/dL \nless than 4.0 less than 71 Reduce dose by 1 unit \n\n4.0â€“6.0 71â€“108 No dose adjustment \nmore than 6.0 more than 108 Increase dose by 1 unit \n\n \nUse in elderly patients (65 years or older)  \nThis medicine can be used in elderly patients. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose.  \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems  \nIf you have kidney or liver problems you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk \nto your doctor about changes in your dose.  \n \nInjecting Fiasp \nThis medicine is only suitable for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) from a reusable \npen. \nBefore you use Fiasp for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use it. Speak to \nyour doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWhere to inject  \nâ€¢ The best places to inject are the front of your waist (abdomen) or upper arms. \nâ€¢ Do not inject into a vein or muscle.  \nâ€¢ Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing \n\nchanges under the skin (see section 4).  \n \nDo not use Fiasp \nâ€¢ if the cartridge or the reusable pen you are using is damaged. Take it back to your supplier. See \n\nyour reusable pen manual for further instructions. \nâ€¢ if the cartridge has not been stored correctly (see section 5 â€˜How to store Fiaspâ€™). \nâ€¢ if the insulin does not appear clear (e.g., cloudy) and colourless.  \n \nHow to inject Fiasp \nâ€¢ Read the manual that comes with your reusable pen. \nâ€¢ Check the name and strength on the label of the cartridge (Penfill) to make sure it is Fiasp. \nâ€¢ Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. \nâ€¢ Needles must not be shared. \n \n \n\n\n\n73 \n\nIf you use more Fiasp than you should  \nIf you use too much insulin your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section \n4 under â€˜Low blood sugarâ€™. \n \nIf you forget to use Fiasp \nIf you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See section 4 \nunder â€˜High blood sugarâ€™. \n \nThree simple steps that may help avoiding low or high blood sugar are:  \nâ€¢ Always keep spare cartridges of Fiasp.  \nâ€¢ Always carry something to show you have diabetes.  \nâ€¢ Always carry products containing sugar with you. See section 4 under â€˜What to do if you get \n\nlow blood sugarâ€™. \n \nIf you stop using Fiasp \nDo not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin this could \nlead to a very high blood sugar level (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (a condition with too \nmuch acid in the blood which is potentially life-threatening). See symptoms and advice in section 4 \nunder â€˜High blood sugarâ€™. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become \nunconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you \nhave symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See \nadvice in â€˜Low blood sugarâ€™ below. \n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Fiasp, stop using this \nmedicine and contact emergency medical service straight away.  \n \nSigns of a serious allergic reaction may include:  \nâ€¢ local reactions (e.g., rash, redness and itching) spread to other parts of your body  \nâ€¢ you suddenly feel unwell with sweating  \nâ€¢ you start being sick (vomiting)  \nâ€¢ you experience difficulty in breathing  \nâ€¢ you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy.  \n \nAllergic reactions such as generalised skin rash and facial swelling may occur. These are uncommon \nand may affect up to 1 in 100 people. See a doctor if the symptoms worsen or you see no improvement \nin a few weeks. \n \nOther side effects include:  \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  \nReaction at administration site: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs \nmay include: rash, redness, inflammation, bruising, irritation, pain and itching. The reactions usually \ndisappear after a few days. \nSkin reactions: Signs of allergy on the skin such as eczema, rash, itching, hives and dermatitis may \noccur. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)  \nChanges under the skin where you use the injection (lipodystrophy): Fatty tissue under the skin may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or get thicker (lipohypertrophy). Changing where you inject each time may \n\n\n\n74 \n\nreduce the risk of developing these skin changes. If you notice these skin changes, tell your doctor or \nnurse. If you keep injecting in the same place, these reactions can become more severe and affect the \namount of medicine your body gets. \n \nGeneral effects from insulin treatment including Fiasp  \n \nâ€¢ Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common) \n \nLow blood sugar may happen if you:  \nDrink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal.  \n \nWarning signs of low blood sugar â€“ these may come on suddenly:  \nâ€¢ headache \nâ€¢ slurred speech \nâ€¢ fast heartbeat \nâ€¢ cold sweat \nâ€¢ cool pale skin \nâ€¢ feeling sick \nâ€¢ feeling very hungry \nâ€¢ tremor or feeling nervous or worried \nâ€¢ feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy \nâ€¢ feeling confused \nâ€¢ difficulty in concentrating \nâ€¢ short-lasting changes in your sight.  \n \nWhat to do if you get low blood sugar  \nâ€¢ If you are conscious, treat your low blood sugar immediately with 15â€“20 g of fast-acting \n\ncarbohydrate: eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like fruit juice, sweets or biscuits \n(always carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case).  \n\nâ€¢ It is recommended that you retest your blood glucose levels after 15â€“20 minutes and re-treat if \nyour blood glucose levels are still less than 4 mmol/L. \n\nâ€¢ Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. \nThen carry on with your insulin treatment as usual.  \n\n \nWhat others need to do if you pass out  \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out.  \n \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must:  \nâ€¢ turn you on your side to avoid choking \nâ€¢ get medical help straight away  \nâ€¢ not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  \n \nYou may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given \nby someone who knows how to use it.  \nâ€¢ If you are given glucagon you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round.  \nâ€¢ If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital.  \n \nIf severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short or \nlong-lasting. It may even cause death.  \n \nTalk to your doctor if:  \nâ€¢ your blood sugar got so low that you passed out  \nâ€¢ you have been given an injection of glucagon \nâ€¢ you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently.  \nThis is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be \nchanged. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \nâ€¢ High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data) \n \nHigh blood sugar may happen if you:  \nEat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough \ninsulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin.  \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar â€“ these normally appear gradually:  \nâ€¢ flushed skin \nâ€¢ dry skin \nâ€¢ feeling sleepy or tired \nâ€¢ dry mouth  \nâ€¢ fruity (acetone) breath \nâ€¢ urinating more often \nâ€¢ feeling thirsty \nâ€¢ losing your appetite \nâ€¢ feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the \nblood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic \ncoma and eventually death.  \n \nWhat to do if you get high blood sugar  \nâ€¢ Test your blood sugar level.  \nâ€¢ Give a correction dose of insulin if you have been taught how to do this. \nâ€¢ Test your urine for ketones.  \nâ€¢ If you have ketones, seek medical help straight away.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.  \n \n \n5.

What Fiasp is and what it is used for \n \nFiasp is a mealtime insulin with a fast-acting blood sugar lowering effect. Fiasp is a solution for \ninjection containing insulin aspart and is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and \nchildren aged 1 year and above. Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough \ninsulin to control the level of blood sugar. Treatment with Fiasp helps to prevent complications from \nyour diabetes.  \n \nFiasp should be injected up to 2 minutes before the start of the meal, with an option to inject up to \n20 minutes after starting the meal. \n \nThis medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for \n3 to 5 hours. \n \nThis medicine should normally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin \npreparations. \n \nThis medicine can also be used for continuous infusion in a pump system. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fiasp \n \nDo not use Fiasp \nâ€¢ if you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fiasp. Be especially aware of the following: \nâ€¢ Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low \n\nblood sugar in section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™. Fiasp starts to lower blood sugar faster \n\n\n\n78 \n\ncompared to other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier \nafter an injection with Fiasp.  \n\nâ€¢ High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) - If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for \nhigh blood sugar in section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™.  \n\nâ€¢ Switching from other insulin medicinal products - The insulin dose may need to be changed if \nyou switch from another insulin.  \n\nâ€¢ Pioglitazone used together with insulin - This may increase the risk of heart failure, see under \nâ€˜Other medicines and Fiaspâ€™ below.  \n\nâ€¢ Eye disorder - Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of \ndiabetic eye disorder. \n\nâ€¢ Pain due to nerve damage - If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may get nerve \nrelated pain, this is usually temporary. \n\nâ€¢ Swelling around your joints - When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep \nmore water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is \nusually only short-lasting. \n\n \nSome conditions and activities can affect how much insulin you need. Talk to your doctor: \nâ€¢ if you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \nâ€¢ if you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level.  \nâ€¢ if you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and talk to your doctor.  \n \nWhen using Fiasp it is strongly recommended that the name and batch number of each package is \nrecorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nThis medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and Fiasp \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to \nchange.  \n \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  \nâ€¢ sulphonamides - for infections  \nâ€¢ anabolic steroids - such as testosterone  \nâ€¢ beta-blockers - for e.g., high blood pressure or angina. They may make it harder to recognise the \n\nwarning signs of low blood sugar (see section 4 â€˜Warning signs of low blood sugarâ€™)  \nâ€¢ acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates) - for pain and mild fever  \nâ€¢ monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors - for depression  \nâ€¢ angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors - for some heart problems or high blood \n\npressure.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ danazol - for endometriosis  \nâ€¢ oral contraceptives (birth control pills)  \nâ€¢ thyroid hormones - for thyroid problems  \nâ€¢ growth hormone - for growth hormone deficiency  \nâ€¢ glucocorticoids such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ - for inflammation  \nâ€¢ sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline - for asthma  \nâ€¢ thiazides - for high blood pressure or if your body is keeping too much water (water retention).  \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide - used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone \n(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \nPioglitazone - oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. Some patients with long-\nstanding type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and \ninsulin developed heart failure. Tell your doctor immediately if you have signs of heart failure such as \nunusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).  \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nFiasp with alcohol  \nIf you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or \nfall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. This medicine can be used during pregnancy; however your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is \nneeded in pregnancy. Avoiding low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the \nhealth of your baby.  \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breastâ€“feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nHaving low blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your blood \nsugar is low, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be dangerous to \nyourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if:  \nâ€¢ you often get low blood sugar  \nâ€¢ you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar.  \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Fiasp \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that this medicine is \nessentially â€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use Fiasp \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nWhen to use Fiasp \nFiasp is a mealtime insulin.  \n \nAdults: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with an option to \ninject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. \nChildren: Fiasp should be injected right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with the possibility \nto inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal in situations, when there is uncertainty about how the \nchild will eat. Ask your doctor for advice on these situations. \n \nThis medicine has its maximum effect between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for \n3 to 5 hours.  \n \nFiasp dose  \nDose for type 1 and type 2 diabetes  \nYour doctor will decide together with you:  \nâ€¢ how much Fiasp you will need at each meal \nâ€¢ when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose.  \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nIf you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a change in \ndiet may alter your need for insulin.  \n \nWhen using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  \n \nDose adjustment for type 2 diabetes \nThe daily dose should be based on your blood sugar level at mealtimes and bedtime from the previous \nday. \nâ€¢ Before breakfast - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before lunch the \n\nprevious day. \nâ€¢ Before lunch - dose should be adjusted according to the blood sugar level before dinner the \n\nprevious day. \nâ€¢ Before dinner - dose should be adjusted according to the bedtime blood sugar level the previous \n\nday. \n \n \n\nTable 1 Dose adjustment \nMealtime or bedtime blood sugar Dose adjustment \n\n mmol/L mg/dL \nless than 4.0 less than 71 Reduce dose by 1 unit \n\n4.0â€“6.0 71â€“108 No dose adjustment \nmore than 6.0 more than 108 Increase dose by 1 unit \n\n \nUse in elderly patients (65 years or older)  \nThis medicine can be used in elderly patients. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose.  \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems  \nIf you have kidney or liver problems you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk \nto your doctor about changes in your dose.  \n \nInjecting Fiasp \nThis medicine is for injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) or for continuous infusion in \npumps. Administration in a pump will require a comprehensive instruction by your healthcare \nprofessional.  \n \nWhere to inject  \nâ€¢ The best places to inject are the front of your waist (abdomen) or upper arms. \nâ€¢ Do not inject into a vein or muscle.  \nâ€¢ Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing \n\nchanges under the skin (see section 4).  \n \nDo not use Fiasp \nâ€¢ if the protective cap on the vial is loose or missing. The vial contains a protective plastic cap in \n\norder to obtain a tamper-proof container. If the vial is not in perfect condition when you get it, \nreturn the vial to your supplier. \n\nâ€¢ if the vial has not been stored correctly (see section 5 â€˜How to store Fiaspâ€™).  \nâ€¢ if the insulin does not appear clear (e.g., cloudy) and colourless.  \n \nHow to inject Fiasp \nBefore you use Fiasp for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use it.  \n1 Check the name and strength on the label of the vial to make sure it is Fiasp. \n2 Remove the protective cap from the vial. \n3 Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. Needles and syringes \n\nmust not be shared. \n4 Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of insulin you are going to inject. \n\nInject the air into the vial. \n\n\n\n81 \n\n5 Turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw the correct insulin dose into the syringe. Pull \nthe needle out of the vial. Push the air out of the syringe and check that the dose is correct. \n\n6 Inject the insulin under the skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse. \n7 Throw away the needle after each injection. \n \nFor use in an infusion pump system  \nFollow the instructions and recommendations from your doctor regarding the use of Fiasp in a pump. \nBefore using Fiasp in the pump system, you must have received a comprehensive instruction in the use \nand information about any actions to be taken in case of illness, high or low blood sugar or failure of \nthe pump system.  \n \nFilling the pump \nâ€¢ Fiasp should never be diluted or mixed with any other insulin.  \nâ€¢ Before inserting the needle, use soap and water to clean your hands and the skin where the \n\nneedle is inserted to avoid any infection at the infusion site.  \nâ€¢ When you fill a new reservoir, do not leave large air bubbles in either the syringe or the tubing.  \nâ€¢ Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in \n\nthe product information supplied with the infusion set.  \n \nTo get the benefit of insulin infusion and to detect possible malfunction of the insulin pump, it is \nrecommended that you measure your blood sugar level regularly.  \n \nWhat to do if the pump system fails  \nYou should always have an alternative delivery method for your insulin available for injection under \nthe skin (for example, a pen injector or syringes) in case the pump system fails. \n \nIf you use more Fiasp than you should  \nIf you use too much insulin your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section \n4 under â€˜Low blood sugarâ€™. \n \nIf you forget to use Fiasp \nIf you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See section 4 \nunder â€˜High blood sugarâ€™. \n \nThree simple steps that may help avoiding low or high blood sugar are: \nâ€¢ Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Fiasp. \nâ€¢ Always carry something to show you have diabetes.  \nâ€¢ Always carry products containing sugar with you. See section 4 under â€˜What to do if you get \n\nlow blood sugarâ€™. \n \nIf you stop using Fiasp \nDo not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin this could \nlead to a very high blood sugar level (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (a condition with too \nmuch acid in the blood which is potentially life-threatening). See symptoms and advice in section 4 \nunder â€˜High blood sugarâ€™. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become \nunconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you \nhave symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See \nadvice in â€˜Low blood sugarâ€™ below.  \n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nIf you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Fiasp, stop using this \nmedicine and contact emergency medical service straight away.  \n \nSigns of a serious allergic reaction may include:  \nâ€¢ local reactions (e.g., rash, redness and itching) spread to other parts of your body  \nâ€¢ you suddenly feel unwell with sweating  \nâ€¢ you start being sick (vomiting)  \nâ€¢ you experience difficulty in breathing  \nâ€¢ you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy.  \n \nAllergic reactions such as generalised skin rash and facial swelling may occur. These are uncommon \nand may affect up to 1 in 100 people. See a doctor if the symptoms worsen or you see no improvement \nin a few weeks. \n \nOther side effects include:  \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  \nReaction at administration site: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs \nmay include: rash, redness, inflammation, bruising, irritation, pain and itching. The reactions usually \ndisappear after a few days.  \nSkin reactions: Signs of allergy on the skin such as eczema, rash, itching, hives and dermatitis may \noccur.  \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)  \nChanges under the skin where you use the injection (lipodystrophy): Fatty tissue under the skin may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or get thicker (lipohypertrophy). Changing where you inject each time may \nreduce the risk of developing these skin changes. If you notice these skin changes, tell your doctor or \nnurse. If you keep injecting in the same place, these reactions can become more severe and affect the \namount of medicine your body gets. \n \nGeneral effects from insulin treatment including Fiasp  \n \nâ€¢ Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common) \n \nLow blood sugar may happen if you:  \nDrink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal.  \n \nWarning signs of low blood sugar â€“ these may come on suddenly:  \nâ€¢ headache \nâ€¢ slurred speech \nâ€¢ fast heartbeat \nâ€¢ cold sweat \nâ€¢ cool pale skin \nâ€¢ feeling sick \nâ€¢ feeling very hungry \nâ€¢ tremor or feeling nervous or worried \nâ€¢ feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy \nâ€¢ feeling confused \nâ€¢ difficulty in concentrating \nâ€¢ short-lasting changes in your sight.  \n \nWhat to do if you get low blood sugar  \nâ€¢ If you are conscious, treat your low blood sugar immediately with 15â€“20 g of fast-acting \n\ncarbohydrate: eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like fruit juice, sweets or biscuits \n(always carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case).  \n\nâ€¢ It is recommended that you retest your blood glucose levels after 15â€“20 minutes and reâ€“treat if \nyour blood glucose levels are still less than 4 mmol/L. \n\n\n\n83 \n\nâ€¢ Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. \nThen carry on with your insulin treatment as usual.  \n\n \nWhat others need to do if you pass out  \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out.  \n \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must:  \nâ€¢ turn you on your side to avoid choking \nâ€¢ get medical help straight away  \nâ€¢ not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  \n \nYou may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given \nby someone who knows how to use it.  \nâ€¢ If you are given glucagon you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round.  \nâ€¢ If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital.  \n \nIf severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short or \nlong-lasting. It may even cause death.  \n \nTalk to your doctor if:  \nâ€¢ your blood sugar got so low that you passed out  \nâ€¢ you have been given an injection of glucagon \nâ€¢ you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently.  \nThis is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be \nchanged.  \n \nâ€¢ High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data) \n \nHigh blood sugar may happen if you:  \nEat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough \ninsulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin.  \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar â€“ these normally appear gradually:  \nâ€¢ flushed skin \nâ€¢ dry skin \nâ€¢ feeling sleepy or tired \nâ€¢ dry mouth \nâ€¢ fruity (acetone) breath \nâ€¢ urinating more often \nâ€¢ feeling thirsty \nâ€¢ losing your appetite \nâ€¢ feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting).  \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the \nblood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic \ncoma and eventually death.  \n \nWhat to do if you get high blood sugar  \nâ€¢ Test your blood sugar level.  \nâ€¢ Give a correction dose of insulin if you have been taught how to do this. \nâ€¢ Test your urine for ketones.  \nâ€¢ If you have ketones, seek medical help straight away.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What Fiasp is and what it is used for \n \nFiasp is an insulin with a fast-acting blood sugar lowering effect. Fiasp is a solution for injection \ncontaining insulin aspart and is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged \n1 year and above. Diabetes is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control \nthe level of blood sugar. Treatment with Fiasp helps to prevent complications from your diabetes.  \n \nAbout PumpCart \nThe PumpCart cartridge is used in an insulin pump designed to be used with this cartridge: \nâ€¢ It covers your total daily insulin needs â€“ both your all-day (basal) and mealtime (bolus) insulin \n\nneeds. \nâ€¢ Before you use a PumpCart cartridge in the pump, your doctor or nurse must have given you \n\ndetailed instructions.  \n \nAll-day (basal) insulin needs: \nWhen you use Fiasp in a pump, your insulin will be constantly delivered into your body. \nâ€¢ This covers your need for insulin throughout the day. \nâ€¢ Before you set or change the all-day (basal) rate, carefully read the pump manual (user guide).  \nâ€¢ If you stop the pump, be aware that the insulin effect will gradually decline over 3 to 5 hours \n \nMealtime (bolus) insulin needs: \nâ€¢ Take your mealtime insulin up to 2 minutes before the start of the meal, with an option to \n\nadminister up to 20 minutes after starting the meal (see section 3, How to use Fiasp). \nâ€¢ The maximum effect happens between 1 and 3 hours after the mealtime delivery. \nâ€¢ The effect lasts for 3 to 5 hours.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fiasp \n \nDo not use FiaspÂ® \n\n\n\n86 \n\nâ€¢ if you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fiasp. Be especially aware of the following: \nâ€¢ Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) â€“ If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low \n\nblood sugar in section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™. Fiasp starts to lower blood sugar faster \ncompared to other fast-acting insulins. If hypoglycaemia occurs, you may experience it earlier \nafter an administration with Fiasp.  \n\nâ€¢ High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) â€“ If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for \nhigh blood sugar in section 4 â€˜Possible side effectsâ€™.  \n\nâ€¢ Switching from other insulin medicinal products â€“ The insulin dose may need to be changed if \nyou switch from another insulin.  \n\nâ€¢ Pioglitazone used together with insulin â€“ This may increase the risk of heart failure, see under \nâ€˜Other medicines and Fiaspâ€™ below.  \n\nâ€¢ Eye disorder â€“ Fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of \ndiabetic eye disorder.  \n\nâ€¢ Pain due to nerve damage â€“ If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may get nerve \nrelated pain, this is usually temporary. \n\nâ€¢ Swelling around your joints â€“ When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep \nmore water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is \nusually only short-lasting. \n\n \nIf you have poor eyesight, please see section 3 â€˜How to use Fiaspâ€™.  \n \nSome conditions and activities can affect how much insulin you need. Talk to your doctor: \nâ€¢ if you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. \nâ€¢ if you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your \n\nblood sugar level.  \nâ€¢ if you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and talk to your doctor.  \n \nWhen using Fiasp it is strongly recommended that the name and batch number of each package is \nrecorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nThis medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and Fiasp \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level â€“ this may mean your insulin dose has to \nchange.  \n \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  \nâ€¢ sulphonamides â€“ for infections  \nâ€¢ anabolic steroids â€“ such as testosterone  \nâ€¢ beta-blockers â€“ for e.g., high blood pressure or angina. They may make it harder to recognise \n\nthe warning signs of low blood sugar (see section 4 â€˜Warning signs of low blood sugarâ€™)  \nâ€¢ acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates) â€“ for pain and mild fever  \nâ€¢ monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors â€“ for depression  \nâ€¢ angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors â€“ for some heart problems or high blood \n\npressure.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take:  \nâ€¢ danazol â€“ for endometriosis  \n\n\n\n87 \n\nâ€¢ oral contraceptives (birth control pills)  \nâ€¢ thyroid hormones â€“ for thyroid problems \nâ€¢ growth hormone â€“ for growth hormone deficiency  \nâ€¢ glucocorticoids such as â€˜cortisoneâ€™ â€“ for inflammation  \nâ€¢ sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline â€“ for asthma  \nâ€¢ thiazides â€“ for high blood pressure or if your body is keeping too much water (water retention).  \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide â€“ used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone \n(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level.  \n \nPioglitazone â€“ oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. Some patients with long-\nstanding type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and \ninsulin developed heart failure. Tell your doctor immediately if you have signs of heart failure such as \nunusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).  \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nFiasp with alcohol  \nIf you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or \nfall. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. This medicine can be used during pregnancy; however your insulin \ndose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is \nneeded in pregnancy. Avoiding low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the \nhealth of your baby.  \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Fiasp during breastâ€“feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nHaving low blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If your blood \nsugar is low, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This could be dangerous to yourself \nor others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if:  \nâ€¢ you often get low blood sugar \nâ€¢ you find it hard to recognise low blood sugar. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Fiasp \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that this medicine is \nessentially â€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use Fiasp \n \nIf you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the screen of the pump, do not use this pump \nwithout help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pump.  \n \nDose and when to use Fiasp  \nAlways use your insulin and adjust your all-day (basal) and mealtime (bolus) doses exactly as your \ndoctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. \nâ€¢ Adjust your mealtime (bolus) insulin based on your blood sugar measurement and food intake. \n \nAdults: \nFiasp mealtime doses should be taken right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with an option to \ntake up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. \n \nChildren: \n\n\n\n88 \n\nFiasp mealtime doses should be taken right before (0-2 minutes) the start of the meal, with the \npossibility to take up to 20 minutes after starting the meal in situations, when there is uncertainty about \nhow the child will eat. Ask your doctor for advice on these situations. \n \nIf you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a change in \ndiet may alter your need for insulin.  \n \nWhen using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  \n \nUse in elderly patients (65 years or older)  \nThis medicine can be used in elderly patients. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose.  \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems  \nIf you have kidney or liver problems you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk \nto your doctor about changes in your dose.  \n \nInjecting Fiasp \nThis medicine is only suitable for injection under the skin (subcutaneous). Only use a pump that is \ndesigned to be used with this cartridge.  \nâ€¢ Before you use the PumpCart cartridge in the pump, your doctor or nurse must have given you \n\ndetailed instructions. \nâ€¢ Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n \nWhere to inject  \nâ€¢ Normally you will inject your insulin in the front of your waist (abdomen). However, if your \n\ndoctor recommends it, you may use your upper arm.  \nâ€¢ Do not inject into a vein or muscle. \nâ€¢ When you change the infusion set (tubing and needle), be sure to change where you insert the \n\nneedle. This may reduce the risk of developing changes under the skin (see section 4 â€˜Possible \nside effectsâ€™).  \n\n \nDo not use Fiasp \nâ€¢ if the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge you are using is dropped, damaged or \n\ncrushed. Take it back to your supplier. \nâ€¢ if the cartridge has not been stored correctly (see section 5 â€˜How to store Fiaspâ€™). \nâ€¢ if the insulin does not appear clear (e.g., cloudy) and colourless.  \n \nDetailed instructions for use are provided on the other side of this leaflet.  \n \nHow to inject Fiasp \nâ€¢ Read and follow the pump manual (user guide) that comes with your insulin pump. \nâ€¢ Make sure to use an infusion set (tubing and needle) suitable for your insulin pump. \nâ€¢ Check the name and strength on the label of the cartridge (PumpCart) to make sure it is Fiasp. \nâ€¢ Infusion set (tubing and needle) and the PumpCart cartridge must not be shared. \nâ€¢ Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in \n\nthe product information supplied with the infusion set. \n \nWhat to do if the pump system fails  \nYou should always have an alternative delivery method for your insulin available for injection under \nthe skin (for example, a pen injector or syringes) in case the pump system fails. \n \nIf you use more Fiasp than you should  \nIf you use too much insulin your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section 4 \nunder â€˜Low blood sugarâ€™. \n \nIf you forget to use Fiasp \n\n\n\n89 \n\nIf you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). See section 4 \nunder â€˜High blood sugarâ€™. \n \nThree simple steps that may help avoiding low or high blood sugar are:  \nâ€¢ Always keep spare cartridges of Fiasp.  \nâ€¢ Always carry something to show you have diabetes.  \nâ€¢ Always carry products containing sugar with you. See section 4 under â€˜What to do if you get \n\nlow blood sugarâ€™. \n \nIf you stop using Fiasp \nDo not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin this could \nlead to a very high blood sugar level (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (a condition with too \nmuch acid in the blood which is potentially life-threatening). See symptoms and advice in section 4 \nunder â€˜High blood sugarâ€™. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become \nunconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you have \nsymptoms of low blood sugar, take actions immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See advice \nin â€˜Low blood sugarâ€™ below. \n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Fiasp, stop using this \nmedicine and contact emergency medical service straight away.  \n \nSigns of a serious allergic reaction may include:  \nâ€¢ local reactions (e.g., rash, redness and itching) spread to other parts of your body  \nâ€¢ you suddenly feel unwell with sweating  \nâ€¢ you start being sick (vomiting)  \nâ€¢ you experience difficulty breathing  \nâ€¢ you experience rapid heartbeat or feel dizzy.  \n \nAllergic reactions such as generalised skin rash and facial swelling may occur. These are uncommon \nand may affect up to 1 in 100 people. See a doctor if the symptoms worsen or you see no improvement \nin a few weeks. \n \nOther side effects include:  \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  \nReaction at administration site: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs \nmay include: rash, redness, inflammation, bruising, irritation, pain and itching. The reactions usually \ndisappear after a few days. \nSkin reactions: Signs of allergy on the skin such as eczema, rash, itching, hives and dermatitis may \noccur. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)  \nChanges under the skin where you use the injection (lipodystrophy): Fatty tissue under the skin may \nshrink (lipoatrophy) or get thicker (lipohypertrophy). Changing where you insert the needle each time \nyou change the infusion set (tubing and needle) may reduce the risk of developing these skin changes. \nIf you notice these skin changes, tell your doctor or nurse. If you keep injecting in the same place, \nthese reactions can become more severe and affect the amount of medicine your body gets. \n \nGeneral effects from insulin treatment including Fiasp \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \nâ€¢ Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common) \n \nLow blood sugar may happen if you:  \nDrink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal.  \n \nWarning signs of low blood sugar â€“ these may come on suddenly:  \nâ€¢ headache \nâ€¢ slurred speech \nâ€¢ fast heartbeat \nâ€¢ cold sweat \nâ€¢ cool pale skin \nâ€¢ feeling sick \nâ€¢ feeling very hungry \nâ€¢ tremor or feeling nervous or worried \nâ€¢ feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy \nâ€¢ feeling confused \nâ€¢ difficulty in concentrating \nâ€¢ short-lasting changes in your sight.  \n \nWhat to do if you get low blood sugar  \nâ€¢ If you are conscious, treat your low blood sugar immediately with 15â€“20 g of fast-acting \n\ncarbohydrate: eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like fruit juice, sweets or biscuits \n(always carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case) and adjust insulin delivery or \nstop your pump.  \n\nâ€¢ It is recommended that you retest your blood glucose levels after 15â€“20 minutes and re-treat if \nyour blood glucose levels are still less than 4 mmol/L. \n\nâ€¢ Wait until the signs of low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. \nThen carry on with your insulin treatment as usual.  \n\n \nWhat others need to do if you pass out  \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out.  \n \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must:  \nâ€¢ turn you on your side to avoid choking \nâ€¢ get medical help straight away  \nâ€¢ not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  \n \nYou may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given \nby someone who knows how to use it.  \nâ€¢ If you are given glucagon you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round.  \nâ€¢ If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital.  \n \nIf severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short or \nlong-lasting. It may even cause death.  \n \nTalk to your doctor if:  \nâ€¢ your blood sugar got so low that you passed out  \nâ€¢ you have been given an injection of glucagon \nâ€¢ you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently.  \nThis is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be \nchanged. \n \nâ€¢ High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data) \n \n\n\n\n91 \n\nHigh blood sugar may happen if you:  \nEat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough \ninsulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin.  \n \nWarning signs of high blood sugar â€“ these normally appear gradually:  \nâ€¢ flushed skin \nâ€¢ dry skin \nâ€¢ feeling sleepy or tired \nâ€¢ dry mouth  \nâ€¢ fruity (acetone) breath \nâ€¢ urinating more often \nâ€¢ feeling thirsty \nâ€¢ losing your appetite \nâ€¢ feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the \nblood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic \ncoma and eventually death.  \n \nWhat to do if you get high blood sugar  \nâ€¢ Test your blood sugar level.  \nâ€¢ Give a correction dose of insulin if you have been taught how to do this. \nâ€¢ Test your urine for ketones.  \nâ€¢ If you have ketones, seek medical help straight away.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.  \n \n \n5. How to store Fiasp \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton, after â€˜EXPâ€™. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nBefore first use:  \nStore in a refrigerator (2Â°C-8Â°C). Do not freeze. Keep away from the freezing element. Keep the \ncartridge in the carton in order to protect from light. \n \nAfter first opening or if carried as a spare:  \nâ€¢ Do not refrigerate during use. \nâ€¢ You can carry your cartridge (PumpCart) with you and keep it at room temperature (not above \n\n30Â°C) for up to 2 weeks. \nâ€¢ After that, it can be used for up to 7 days below 37Â°C in a pump designed to be used with this \n\ncartridge. \nâ€¢ Keep the PumpCart cartridge in the outer carton until use to protect it from damage.
