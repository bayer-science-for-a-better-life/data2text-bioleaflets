NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFABLYN 500 microgram film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains lasofoxifene tartrate, equivalent to 500 micrograms lasofoxifene. \n \nExcipient: Each film-coated tablet contains 71.34 mg lactose. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nTriangular, peach-coloured, film-coated tablets debossed with \u201cPfizer\u201d on one side and \u201cOPR 05\u201d on \nthe other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFABLYN is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of \nfracture. A significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures but not hip \nfractures has been demonstrated (see section 5.1). \n \nWhen determining the choice of FABLYN or other therapies, including estrogens, for a \npostmenopausal woman, consideration should be given to menopausal symptoms, effects on uterine \nand breast tissues, and cardiovascular risks and benefits (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAdult (postmenopausal women): \n \nThe recommended dose is one 500 microgram tablet daily. \n \nThe tablet may be taken any time of day without regard to food and beverage intake. \n \nSupplemental calcium and/or vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate. \nPostmenopausal women require an average of 1,500 mg/day of elemental calcium. The recommended \nintake of vitamin D is 400-800 IU daily. \n \nChildren and adolescents below 18 years of age: \n \nThere is no indication for FABLYN in children and adolescents below 18 years of age since the medicinal \nproduct is for use in postmenopausal women only. Therefore safety and efficacy have not been studied (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nElderly women (65 years and older): \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly female patients (see section 5.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 3\n\nHepatic insufficiency: \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency (see section 5.2). \nSafety and efficacy of lasofoxifene have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency with liver \nfunction test > 1.5 ULN; therefore, FABLYN should be used with caution in these patients. \n \nRenal insufficiency: \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency (see section 5.2). \nSafety and efficacy of lasofoxifene have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal insufficiency; \ntherefore, FABLYN should be used with caution in these patients. \n \nDue to the chronic nature of the disease process, FABLYN is intended for long-term use (see section 5.1). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nActive or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary \nembolism and retinal vein thrombosis. \n \nUnexplained uterine bleeding. \n \nPregnancy and lactation: FABLYN is only for use in postmenopausal women. It must not be taken by \nwomen of child-bearing potential, pregnant women and lactating women (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn clinical trials, FABLYN-treated women had an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (deep \nvein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) compared to placebo. Other venous thromboembolic events \ncould also occur. A less serious event, superficial thrombophlebitis, also has been reported more frequently \nwith FABLYN compared to placebo. The risk-benefit balance should be considered in patients at risk of \nvenous thromboembolic events of any aetiology (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Because immobilization \nincreases the risk for venous thromboembolic events independent of therapy, FABLYN should be \ndiscontinued at least 3 weeks prior to and during prolonged immobilization (e.g., post-surgical recovery, \nprolonged bed rest), and therapy should be resumed only after the patient is fully ambulatory. In addition, \nwomen taking FABLYN should be advised to move about periodically during prolonged travel. \n \nAny unexplained vaginal bleeding should be investigated as clinically indicated. FABLYN-treated and \nplacebo-treated groups had similar incidences of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nLasofoxifene has been associated with benign endometrial effects. These included, in some subjects, a \nsmall excess in the incidence of vaginal bleeding as well as endometrial cystic change viewed on \nultrasound and histological benign cystic atrophy (a variant of atrophic endometrium). These cystic \nfindings contributed to an approximate 1.5 mm increase in mean endometrial thickness. As a consequence \nof these benign effects, more FABLYN-treated patients had a diagnostic uterine procedure compared to \nplacebo-treated patients in the PEARL trial (see section 5.1). However, in clinical practice, these benign \nfindings do not warrant further evaluation in women with no vaginal bleeding (in accordance with \nguidelines for postmenopausal women), as the risks of diagnostic uterine procedures in asymptomatic \nwomen outweigh any benefits. Pathologists should be made aware of a history of lasofoxifene use when \nassessing endometrial histology, to ensure an accurate diagnosis of benign cystic atrophy when present. \n \nThe concurrent use of FABLYN and systemic estrogen or hormone therapy has not been studied and \ntherefore concomitant use of FABLYN with systemic estrogens is not recommended. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 4\n\nFABLYN has not been studied in women with a prior history of breast cancer. No data are available on its \nconcomitant use with agents used in the treatment of early or advanced breast cancer. Therefore, FABLYN \nshould be used for the treatment of osteoporosis only after the treatment of breast cancer, including \nadjuvant therapy, has been completed. \n \nAny unexplained breast abnormality occurring during FABLYN therapy should be investigated. FABLYN \ndoes not eliminate the risk of breast cancer (see section 5.1). \n \nFABLYN may increase the incidence of hot flushes and is not effective in reducing hot flushes associated \nwith estrogen deficiency. In some asymptomatic patients, hot flushes may occur upon beginning therapy. \n \nLimited clinical data suggest that in patients with a history of oral oestrogen-induced hypertriglyceridemia \n(> 5.6 mmol/l), lasofoxifene may be associated with a marked increase in serum triglycerides. Patients with \nthis medical history should have serum triglycerides monitored when taking lasofoxifene. \n \nLasofoxifene is highly protein bound, predominantly cleared by metabolism and is likely to undergo \nenterohepatic circulation (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy of FABLYN have not been evaluated in \npatients with liver function test > 1.5 ULN; therefore, FABLYN should be used with caution in these \npatients. \n \nSafety and efficacy of FABLYN have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal insufficiency; \ntherefore, FABLYN should be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.2 and section 5.2). \n \nFABLYN contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBased on the absence of clinically relevant effects of cholestyramine (anion exchange resin), \nfluconazole (CYP2C9 inhibitor), ketoconazole (CYP3A4/5 inhibitor) and paroxetine (CYP2D6 \ninhibitor) on lasofoxifene pharmacokinetics, other anion exchange resins and other inhibitors of these \nCYP isoforms are unlikely to produce clinically meaningful alterations in FABLYN exposure and no \ndose adjustments are required. \n \nLasofoxifene clearance may be increased in patients chronically treated with inducers of CYP3A4 and \nUGTs (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates and St John\u2019s Wort) resulting in reduced steady-\nstate concentrations and may result in reduced efficacy. \n \nKetoconazole - The strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor ketoconazole increased the systemic exposure of \nlasofoxifene by 20% which is not considered to be clinically meaningful. \n \nParoxetine - The strong CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine increased the systemic exposure of lasofoxifene \nby 35% which is not considered to be clinically meaningful. \n \nProton pump inhibitors \u2013 Data on the effect of concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors \n(PPIs) with lasofoxifene is not available; thus, use of these agents with lasofoxifene should be \nconsidered with caution. \n \nIn clinical studies, lasofoxifene did not alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) \nand chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1 substrate) or the pharmacokinetics of warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), \nmethylprednisolone (CYP3A4 substrate) or digoxin (MDR1 P-glycoprotein substrate). Therefore \nFABLYN is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are cleared by \nmetabolism via these CYP isoforms, or are transported by MDR1 P-glycoprotein. \n \nWarfarin - Lasofoxifene had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of R- and S- warfarin. Mean \ninternational normalized ratio (INR) AUC and maximum value of INR after single-dose warfarin \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 5\n\nadministration with lasofoxifene were approximately 8% and 16% lower, respectively, than after \nwarfarin alone. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nFABLYN is only for use in postmenopausal women. FABLYN must not be taken by women of child-\nbearing potential (see section 4.3). There are no adequate data from the use of lasofoxifene in pregnant \nwomen. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown.  \n \nLactation \n \nFABLYN is only for use in postmenopausal women. FABLYN must not be taken during lactation (see \nsection 4.3). It is not known whether lasofoxifene is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of lasofoxifene in milk. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nFABLYN has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of FABLYN in the treatment of osteoporosis was assessed in a large (8,556 patients) \ndouble-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multinational Phase 3 fracture trial (the PEARL study). \nThe duration of treatment in postmenopausal women was 60 months, 2,852 were randomized to \nFABLYN and 2,852 were randomized to placebo. \n \nWithin this study, 12.9% of FABLYN-treated women and 12.3% of placebo-treated women \ndiscontinued therapy due to adverse events. \n \nVenous Thromboembolic Events: The most serious adverse reaction related to FABLYN was VTE \n(deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis). Through 5 years of \nfollow-up, 37 FABLYN-treated women (1.3%, or 2.90 per 1,000 patients years) had a VTE compared \nto 18 placebo-treated women (0.6%, or 1.41 per 1,000 patients years) and the hazard ratio was 2.06 \n(95% CI: 1.17, 3.61). \n \nAs observed with other Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs), slightly decreased \n(approximately 4%) platelet counts were observed in lasofoxifene-treated patients in PEARL. \n \nCommon adverse reactions considered to be related to FABLYN therapy were muscle spasms, hot \nflush and vaginal discharge. Muscle spasms occurred in about one in 9 patients . Hot flush occurred in \nabout one in 11 patients and was most commonly reported during the first 6 months of treatment. \nVaginal discharge occurred in about one in 26 patients. \n \nThe safety of FABLYN in the treatment of osteoporosis was also assessed in a Phase 2 placebo-\ncontrolled trial in Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese women. The duration of treatment in \npostmenopausal women was 12 months, 124 were exposed to FABLYN and 125 were exposed to \nplacebo. Within this study, 3.2% of FABLYN-treated women and 8.0% of placebo-treated women \ndiscontinued therapy due to adverse events. \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions occurring in the two osteoporosis treatment clinical trials that occurred \nat an incidence greater than placebo. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 6\n\n \nMost of the adverse reactions occurring during the studies were mild and generally did not require \ndiscontinuation of therapy. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency (very common (\u22651/10), common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) and rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000)).

FABLYN overdose has been reported. \n \nLasofoxifene has been administered to postmenopausal women at single doses as high as 100 mg (200 \ntimes the recommended unit dose) and multiple doses as high as 10 mg/day (20 times the \nrecommended dose) for up to one year without dose-related serious adverse reactions. \n \nThere is no specific antidote for FABLYN. In the event of overdose, general supportive measures \nshould be initiated based on the patient\u2019s signs and symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), ATC code: {not yet \nassigned}  \n \nDecreases in estrogen levels after menopause or oophorectomy lead to accelerated bone loss due to \nincreased bone turnover, where bone resorption exceeds bone formation. The increased turnover \ncauses accelerated bone loss because the compensatory increase in bone formation is not sufficient to \noffset increased bone resorption. In some women, these changes will eventually lead to decreased \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 9\n\nbone mass, osteoporosis, and increased risk for fractures, particularly of the spine, hip, and wrist. \nVertebral fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women. \n \nLasofoxifene is a SERM whose biological actions are largely mediated through binding to estrogen \nreceptors. This binding results in the activation of some estrogenic pathways and a blockade of others. \nLasofoxifene produces tissue and cell-specific effects in estrogen-responsive tissues. \n \nClinical data indicate that FABLYN has an estrogen-like agonist effect on bone as well as antagonistic \neffects on the breast. The effects of FABLYN on bone are manifested as reductions in the serum and \nurine levels of bone turnover markers, increases in bone mineral density (BMD), and decreases in \nincidence of fractures. \n \nSkeletal effects: \n \nBone turnover \n \nIn the osteoporosis treatment trials, FABLYN therapy resulted in consistent, statistically significant \nsuppression of bone resorption and bone formation, as reflected by changes in serum and urine \nmarkers of bone turnover (e.g., C-telopeptide and markers of bone formation: osteocalcin, procollagen \ntype 1 N-terminal propeptide, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase). The suppression of bone \nturnover markers was evident by 3 months and persisted throughout the 36-month observation period \nin a sub-study of the PEARL study. \n \n5-year results from large, multinational fracture trial (PEARL) \n \nThe effects of FABLYN on fracture incidence (table 2) were examined through 5 years; and BMD and \nbone biomarkers in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were examined through 3 years in the \nPEARL study. The study population consisted of 8,556 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis as \ndefined by low BMD (vertebral or hip BMD at least 2.5 standard deviations below the mean value for \nhealthy young women). Women enrolled in this study had a median age of 67 years (range 59 to 80) \nand a median time since menopause of 20 years. All women in the study received calcium (1,000 \nmg/day) and Vitamin D (400-800 IU/day). \n \nTable 2: Fracture incidence in postmenopausal women over 5 years \n \n FABLYN Placebo Relative risk reduction (95% \n\nCI) vs. placebo \nNew radiographic vertebral fractures \nPercentage of patients with new fracture \n\nn=2,748\n5.6% \n\nn=2,744\n9.3% \n\n41%a \n(28%, 52%) \n\nNew radiographic vertebral fracture in patients with \u2265 \n1 baseline fracture \nPercentage of patients with new fracture \n\nn=778\n8.7% \n\nn=774\n14.2%\n\n42%b \n(21%, 57%) \n\nNew radiographic vertebral fracture in patients \nwithout any prevalent fracture at baseline \nPercentage of patients with new fracture \n\nn=1,970\n4.4% \n\nn=1,970\n7.4% \n\n41%c \n(23%, 55%) \n\nNon-vertebral fractures \nPercentage of patients with non-vertebral fracture \n\nn=2,852\n8.1% \n\nn=2,852\n10.4%\n\n24%d \n(9%, 36%) \n\nAll clinical fractures \nPercentage of patients with clinical fracture \n\nn=2,852\n9.3% \n\nn=2,852\n12.1%\n\n25%e \n(12%, 36%) \n\nAbbreviations: n= number of patients; CI = Confidence Intervals \na p < 0.0001; b p = 0.0004; c p = 0.0002; d p = 0.0020; e p = 0.0004 \n \n \n-Radiographic vertebral fractures \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 10\n\n \nFABLYN significantly decreased the incidence of new radiographic vertebral fractures (excluding \nworsening of previous fractures) from 9.3% for placebo to 5.6% for FABLYN (relative risk reduction \n= 41%, p < 0.0001).

This decrease was observed through \nthe first year and maintained through 5 years. \n \n-Bone mineral density \n \nIn a 3-year substudy of the PEARL study (n=760), FABLYN significantly increased BMD (compared \nto placebo) at lumbar spine (3.3%), total hip (3.0%), femoral neck (3.3%), greater trochanter (3.6%), \nintertrochanteric area (2.6%), Ward\u2019s triangle (5.9%) and forearm (1.8%) at 3 years. FABLYN also \nsignificantly increased whole body bone mineral content (BMC), compared to placebo, at 3 years. \nSignificant increases in BMD were observed as early as 3 months for lumbar spine and total hip. \n \nAn analysis was conducted of the subjects who were referred to their physician for consideration of \ntreatment with an alternative osteoporosis medicinal product if one of the following was observed: a) \n\u22657% BMD loss at LS or \u226510% BMD loss at femoral neck at Month 12; b) \u226511% BMD loss at lumbar \nspine (LS) or \u226514% BMD loss at femoral neck at Month 24; c) \u22652 on-study radiographic vertebral \nfractures by Month 24. These referrals were significantly less frequent in the FABLYN group (0.9%) \nthan in the placebo group (3.3%). \n \nResults from one-year trial in Asian subjects \n \nThe effects of FABLYN on BMD in postmenopausal Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese women with \nosteoporosis were also examined in a one-year, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind \nosteoporosis treatment trial. The study population consisted of 497 women with osteoporosis as \ndefined by low vertebral BMD (T-score \u2264 2.5). Women in this study had a median age of 63 years \n(range 44 to 79) and a median time since menopause of 13 years. All women in the study received \ncalcium (600-1200 mg/day) and Vitamin D (400-800 IU/day). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 11\n\n \nIn this study, FABLYN significantly increased spine and hip (total hip and all subcomponents of the \nhip) BMD by 2 to 4%. It also reduced markers of bone turnover. \n \nBone histomorphometry \n \nBone formed during two years\u2019 administration of lasofoxifene is of normal quality. To assess bone \nquality, bone biopsies were obtained from 71 postmenopausal women enrolled in BMD trials after 2 \nyears of treatment. There was no evidence of osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis, cellular toxicity, woven \nbone or other abnormalities affecting the quality of the bone following lasofoxifene treatment. \n \nEffects on the endometrium: \n \nThe following results of the effects of FABLYN on the endometrium through 5 years of exposure are \nreported from the PEARL study. \n \nThere was no difference between FABLYN- and placebo-treated women in the incidences of \nendometrial carcinoma and endometrial hyperplasia. \n \nLasofoxifene may be associated with benign endometrial effects: endometrial cystic change viewed on \nultrasound and histological benign cystic atrophy (a variant of atrophic endometrium), contributing to \napproximately 1.5 mm increase in mean endometrial thickness. In clinical practice, these benign \nfindings do not warrant further evaluation in women with no vaginal bleeding, in accordance with \nguidelines for postmenopausal women (see section 4.4). \n \nThe incidence of endometrial cystic change and endometrial thickness was analyzed in a subset of the \nstudy population (298 patients) with an annual transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) through 3 years. \nPlacebo-treated women had a 1.9% incidence in cystic change over 3 years, whereas the FABLYN-\ntreated women had a 20.4% incidence. All histology findings were benign. Placebo-treated women \nhad a 0.7 mm mean decrease from baseline in endometrial thickness over 3 years, whereas the \nFABLYN-treated women had a 1.4 mm mean increase. The increase was observed at 12 months, and \ndid not significantly increase through 3 years. In some cases, these findings were observed to resolve \nspontaneously on treatment. \n \nIn all women with a uterus at baseline, histologically benign endometrial polyps were reported in 34 of \n2,302 (1.5%) FABLYN-treated women versus 18 of 2,309 (0.8%) placebo-treated women. In a subset \nof the study population designed to look at endometrial histology (1,080 patients) with a TVU at 3 \nyears, histologically benign endometrial polyps were reported in 20 of 366 (5.5%) FABLYN-treated \nwomen and 12 of 360 (3.3%) placebo-treated women. \n \nThe overall incidence of vaginal bleeding was low (\u2264 2.6% in all treatment groups). Vaginal bleeding \nwas reported in 74 (2.6%) FABLYN-treated women versus 37 (1.3%) placebo-treated women. The \nnumber of subjects discontinuing treatment as a result of vaginal bleeding was low [FABLYN: 4 \n(0.1%), placebo: 0]. \n \nThe number of hysterectomies in the FABLYN-treated group (27/2,302 patients, 1.2%) and the \nplacebo-treated group (24/2,309 patients, 1.0%) were similar. To assess the effect of FABLYN on \ndiagnostic uterine procedures (i.e., hysteroscopy, saline infused sonohysterogram, endometrial biopsy, \npolypectomy or dilation and curettage), an analysis was conducted on women without planned TVU \nsurveillance (4,055 patients). More FABLYN-treated patients (7.0%) had a diagnostic procedure \ncompared to placebo-treated patients (2.7%). Diagnostic uterine procedures were performed in a \ngreater number of FABLYN-treated patients as a result of vaginal bleeding (as mandated by the \nprotocol) and asymptomatic endometrial findings (e.g., suspected uterine polyps, endometrial \nthickness). \n \nEffects on breast: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 12\n\n \nOver the 5 years of the PEARL study (involving 8,556 patients), FABLYN treatment compared to \nplacebo reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 85% (placebo: 20 (0.7%), FABLYN: 3 (0.1%); \nHR 0.15 (CI 0.04, 0.50)), the risk of all breast cancer by 79% (placebo: 24 (0.9%), FABLYN: 5 \n(0.2%); HR 0.21 (CI 0.08, 0.55)), the risk of estrogen receptor (ER) positive invasive breast cancer by \n83% (placebo: 18 (0.7%), FABLYN: 3 (0.1%); HR 0.17 (CI 0.05, 0.57)) and the risk of estrogen \nreceptor (ER) positive breast cancer by 81% (placebo: 21 (0.8%), FABLYN: 4 (0.1%); HR 0.19 (CI \n0.07, 0.56)). FABLYN has no effect on the risk of ER negative breast cancer or ER negative invasive \nbreast cancers. These observations support the conclusion that lasofoxifene has no intrinsic estrogen \nagonist activity in breast tissue. \n  \nEffects on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk: \n \nThe effect of FABLYN on the lipid profile was evaluated in a 3-year substudy of the PEARL study; \nthe substudy enrolled 1,014 postmenopausal women. Relative to placebo, FABLYN significantly \ndecreased total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, LDL-associated apolipoprotein B-100, and high \nsensitivity C-reactive protein (median changes -10.4%, -15.8%, -11.8%, -12.5%, respectively); no \nsignificant changes versus placebo were seen for HDL cholesterol or VLDL cholesterol. Statistically \nsignificant increases were seen for apolipoprotein A-1, which is associated with HDL cholesterol, and \nserum triglycerides (median changes vs. placebo 6.1% and 4.9%, respectively). \n \nAt 5 years in the overall study population (N=8,556), the incidence of major coronary events, \nincluding coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, new ischemic heart disease, hospitalization \nfor unstable angina, and revascularisation procedures, was significantly lower. There were 0.51 \nevents/100 patient-years for FABLYN-treated patients compared to 0.75 events/100 patient-years in \nplacebo-treated patients (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50, 0.93, p= 0.016). In the same study at 5 years, there \nwas no increase in the risk of stroke including hemorrhagic, ischemic, embolic stroke, stroke type \nunspecified and transient ischemic attacks in FABLYN-treated patients. There were 0.48 events/100 \npatient years in the placebo group and 0.36 events/100 patient years among FABLYN-treated patients \n(HR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.51, 1.10, p = 0.140). \n \nEffects on vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA): \n \nThe efficacy of FABLYN in the treatment of VVA was investigated in two 12-week Phase 3 studies in \npostmenopausal women with moderate or severe signs and symptoms of VVA, regardless of \nosteoporosis status (involving 889 patients). In both studies, it decreased the severity of the subject\u2019s \nmost bothersome baseline VVA symptom, decreased vaginal pH, decreased the percentage of vaginal \nparabasal cells from the maturation index (MI) and increased the percentage of vaginal superficial \ncells from the MI. Similar results for vaginal pH and MI were observed in the PEARL study. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe disposition of lasofoxifene was evaluated in 758 subjects in conventional clinical pharmacology \nstudies. Pharmacokinetic data from over 2,000 postmenopausal women including patients in selected \nosteoporosis clinical trials contributed to a population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nAbsorption: \n \nLasofoxifene is slowly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with maximal plasma concentrations \nattained on average by approximately 6 hours after dosing. Ingestion of a high fat meal does not \nchange the oral bioavailability of lasofoxifene. FABLYN may be administered any time of day \nwithout regard to food or beverage intake. \n \nDistribution: \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 13\n\nThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of lasofoxifene in postmenopausal women is approximately \n1,350 l. \n \nLasofoxifene is highly bound to proteins in human plasma (>99%). Lasofoxifene binds to both \nalbumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein; however, it does not affect the binding of either warfarin or \npropranolol. \n \nMetabolism: \n \nBiotransformation and disposition of lasofoxifene in humans have been determined following oral \nadministration of 14C-labeled lasofoxifene. Lasofoxifene is extensively metabolized in humans. Five \nmetabolic pathways of lasofoxifene have been identified: direct glucuronidation; direct sulfation; \nhydroxylation at the phenyl tetraline moiety (with subsequent conjugative metabolism of the catechol \nintermediates by methylation and glucuronidation); oxidation at the pyrrolidine ring; and phenyl \nhydroxylation. Three metabolites of lasofoxifene were detected in plasma: the direct glucuronide \nconjugate, the glucuronide of a hydroxylated metabolite, and the methylated catechol. \n \nThe binding affinities of the major circulating metabolites of lasofoxifene were at least 31-fold and 18-\nfold less than those of lasofoxifene for the estrogen receptor alpha and the estrogen receptor beta, \nrespectively, indicating that these metabolites are unlikely to contribute to the pharmacologic activity \nof lasofoxifene. Oxidation, by multiple cytochrome P450s including CYPs 2D6 and 3A4/5, and \nconjugation of lasofoxifene are the two primary mechanisms of elimination of lasofoxifene from the \nsystemic circulation. The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of lasofoxifene in postmenopausal women is \napproximately 6.6 l/hr. \n \nElimination: \n \nLasofoxifene has a half-life of approximately 6 days. Lasofoxifene and its metabolites are primarily \nexcreted in feces, with a minor component of urinary excretion of active substance-related material. \nFollowing oral administration of 14C-labeled lasofoxifene in solution to humans, approximately 72% \nof the radioactive dose was recovered by day 24 (approximately 66% in feces and 6% in urine). Less \nthan 2% of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged lasofoxifene. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity: \n \nLasofoxifene exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose range following single-dose (up to \n100 mg) and multiple-dose (up to 20 mg once daily) administration. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of \nlasofoxifene are consistent with expectations from its single-dose pharmacokinetics. \n \nAt steady state, the half-life of lasofoxifene in postmenopausal women is approximately 6 days, \nresulting in small fluctuations in concentrations over the 24-hour dosing interval. \n \nPaediatric: \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of lasofoxifene have not been evaluated in a paediatric population. \n \nElderly: \n \nNo clinically meaningful differences in lasofoxifene pharmacokinetic were observed over the age \nrange of 40 to 80 years of age based on the results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis. No dose \nadjustment for FABLYN is necessary in elderly patients. \n \nRace: \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no discernible difference in lasofoxifene pharmacokinetics \nwas detected in different racial groups. This analysis included 2,049 postmenopausal women \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 14\n\nconsisting of 85.5% Caucasian, 8.6% Hispanic, 3.4% Asian, and 1.9% African American. The results \nof a phase 1 study in Japanese and Caucasian women was consistent with the population \npharmacokinetic analysis and showed no discernible difference in lasofoxifene pharmacokinetics in \nthese two populations. \n \nGender: \n \nSince FABLYN is indicated for use only in postmenopausal women, no assessment of the effect of \ngender on lasofoxifene pharmacokinetics has been made. \n \nHepatically impaired patients: \n \nLasofoxifene was studied, as a single 0.25 mg dose, in healthy subjects and subjects with mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment. Plasma lasofoxifene exposure was approximately the same in healthy \nsubjects as in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and was modestly \nincreased (38%) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) compared to \nhealthy subjects. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. No dose adjustment \nfor FABLYN is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency. Subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment have not been studied (see section 4.4). \n \nRenally impaired patients: \n \nSince less than 2% of lasofoxifene is recovered in urine as unchanged active substance, a study in \nsubjects with renal insufficiency was not conducted. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there \nwere no clinically meaningful differences in lasofoxifene pharmacokinetics between postmenopausal \nwomen with estimated creatinine clearance as low as 32 ml/min and those with normal creatinine \nclearance. No dose adjustment for FABLYN is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal \ninsufficiency (see section 4.4). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nLasofoxifene was not genotoxic in any of the battery of tests applied. In two-year carcinogenicity \nstudies conducted in rats (\u22651 mg/kg/day; 7 times systemic exposure following a human dose of 0.5 \nmg/day based on plasma AUC) an increased incidence of renal tubular adenoma and carcinoma in \nmales and granulosa cell tumours of the ovary in females was noted. In the corresponding 2-year study \nin mice (\u22652 mg/kg/day; less than systemic exposure following a human dose of 0.5 mg/day based on \nplasma AUC), there was an increased incidence of adrenal cortical adenoma and carcinoma, interstitial \ncell tumors of the testis, benign and malignant ovarian tumors and benign uterine glandular polyps. \nAlthough all of these tumours are believed to be the result of rodent-specific hormonal mechanisms, \ntheir relevance for humans is currently unknown. Based on 3- and 5-year human data in the clinical \ntrials, the incidence of cancer during treatment with lasofoxifene was not higher than for placebo. \n \nLasofoxifene was not teratogenic in rats up to a dose of 10mg/kg (approximately 53 times the AUC in \nhumans) or rabbits up to a dose of 3 mg/kg (below the level of systemic exposure in humans). \nIncreased incidence of imperforate anus, hypoplastic tail, edema and limb flexures noted in fetuses of \npregnant rats dosed at 100 mg/kg (approximately 400 times the AUC in humans) were associated with \nincreased embryo-fetal lethality and generalized failure to thrive. In fertility studies conducted in rats \nwith lasofoxifene, slight effects on male reproductive performance occurred at \u226510 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 42 times the AUC in humans) as evidenced by decreases in copulation index, \nimplantation sites, and fetuses sired. Reduced fertility, and an increase in pre- and post-implantation \nloss leading to reduced litter size and prolonged gestation were observed in females treated at \u22650.01 \nmg/kg/day (below the level of systemic exposure in humans). In a prenatal and postnatal study in rats, \nat \u22650.01 mg/kg/day lasofoxifene delayed and/or disrupted parturition, increased pup mortality at birth, \naltered the achievement of developmental milestones, and reduced growth. Overall, the reproductive \nand developmental effects observed in animals are consistent with the SERM class of compounds. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 15\n\n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  \n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours.  \n\uf0b7 If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What FABLYN is and what it is used for  \n2. Before you take FABLYN \n3. How to FABLYN  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store FABLYN \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT FABLYN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nFABLYN is used to treat osteoporosis in women after the menopause (postmenopausal osteoporosis) \nwho are likely to break bones, especially in the spine, hips and wrists. It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERM). \n \nIn women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, FABLYN reduces the risk of both fractures of the spine \n(vertebral fractures) and non-spine fractures (non-vertebral fractures), but not hip fractures. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE FABLYN \n \nDo not take FABLYN \n \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to lasofoxifene or any of the other ingredients of FABLYN.  \n\uf0b7 if you currently have or previously had blood clots, for example in your veins, lungs or eyes \n\n(deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or retinal vein thrombosis).  \n\uf0b7 if you have any vaginal bleeding. This must be investigated by your doctor before starting \n\ntreatment.  \n\uf0b7 if you could still become pregnant.  \n\uf0b7 if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 36\n\nTake special care with FABLYN \n\uf0b7 if you are immobile for some time, such as, needing to be admitted to a hospital or having to \n\nstay in bed while recovering from an operation or an illness, as these may increase your risk of \nblood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or retinal vein thrombosis). Your \ndoctor may recommend that you stop treatment at least 3 weeks prior to this time. \nTreatment with FABLYN can be restarted as soon as you regain your mobility and in \nconsultation with your doctor. \n\n \n\uf0b7 if you are taking FABLYN, you should walk around or exercise your legs and feet at regular \n\nintervals when traveling long distances. This is because sitting for a long time in the same \nposition may prevent good blood circulation and may increase your risk of blood clots. \n\n \nIt is unlikely that FABLYN will cause vaginal bleeding. So any vaginal bleeding while you take \nFABLYN is unexpected. You should have this investigated by your doctor. \n \nThe following are reasons why this medicine may not be suitable for you. You should talk to your \ndoctor before starting to take FABLYN: \n \n\uf0b7 if you have or have had breast cancer.  \n\uf0b7 if you experience any unexplained breast abnormality.  \n\uf0b7 if you have severe liver disease.  \n\uf0b7 if you have severe kidney disease. \n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. If you are taking estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) \nor hormone replacement therapy (HRT), FABLYN may not be suitable for you. \n \nTaking FABLYN with food and drink \n \nFABLYN can be taken with or without food and drink. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nFABLYN is only for women after the menopause and must not be taken by women who can still \nbecome pregnant. \n \nDo not take FABLYN if you are pregnant or breast-feeding as it might be excreted in mother\u2019s milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nFABLYN has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of FABLYN  \n \nFABLYN contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some \nsugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO TAKE FABLYN \n \nAlways take FABLYN exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. The usual dose is one tablet each day. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 37\n\n \nSwallow the tablet whole. You may take it with or without food. \n \nIf you wish, you may take it with water or another beverage of choice. \n \nYour doctor may also advise you to take Calcium and Vitamin D supplements while you are treated \nwith FABLYN if your daily intakes are not considered sufficient. \n \nIf you take more FABLYN than you should \n \nIf you take more tablets than you should, tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to take FABLYN  \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. Take your next tablet and continue as \nbefore. \n \nIf you stop taking FABLYN  \n \nYou should talk to your doctor before stopping FABLYN. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
