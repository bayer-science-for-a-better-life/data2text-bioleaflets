PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for infusion\nThe solution is clear or slightly opalescent and colourless or pale yellow.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nReplacement therapy in adults, and children and adolescents (0-18 years) in:\n\n Primary immunodeficiency syndromes (PID) with impaired antibody production (see \nsection 4.4).\n\n Secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients who suffer from severe or recurrent infections, \nineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure (PSAF)* or \nserum IgG level of <4 g/l.\n\n*PSAF = failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide \nand polypeptide antigen vaccines\n\n\n\n3\n\nImmunomodulation in adults, and children and adolescents (0-18 years) in:\n\n Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), in patients at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery \nto correct the platelet count.\n\n Guillain Barré syndrome.\n Kawasaki disease (in conjunction with acetylsalicylic acid; see 4.2).\n Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).\n Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nReplacement therapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the treatment of immunodeficiency.\n\nPosology\n\nThe dose and dose regimen is dependent on the indication.\n\nIn replacement therapy the dose may need to be individualised for each patient dependent on the \npharmacokinetic and clinical response. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in \nunderweight or overweight patients. \n\nThe following dose regimens are given as a guideline.\n\nReplacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency syndromes\n\nThe dose regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG (measured before the next infusion) of at \nleast 5 to 6 g/L. Three to six months are required after the initiation of therapy for equilibration \n(steady-state IgG levels) to occur. The recommended starting dose is 0.4-0.8 g/kg given once, \nfollowed by at least 0.2 g/kg given every three to four weeks.\n\nThe dose required to achieve a trough level of 5-6 g/L is of the order of 0.2-0.8 g/kg/month. \nThe dose interval when steady state has been reached varies from 3-4 weeks.\n\nIgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. To \nreduce the rate of bacterial infection, it may be necessary to increase the dose and aim for higher \ntrough levels.\n\nSecondary immunodeficiencies (as defined in 4.1.)\n\nThe recommended dose is 0.2-0.4 g/kg every three to four weeks.\n\nIgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. \nDose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, an increase may \nbe necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be considered when the patient \nremains infection free.\n\nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia\n\nThere are two alternative treatment schedules:\n 0.8-1g/kg given on day one; this dose may be repeated once within 3 days\n 0.4 g/kg given daily for two to five days.\n\nThe treatment can be repeated if relapse occurs.\n\n\n\n4\n\nGuillain Barré syndrome\n\n0.4 g/kg/day over 5 days (possible repeat of dosing in case of relapse).\n\nKawasaki Disease\n\n2 g/kg should be administered as a single dose. Patients should receive concomitant treatment with \nacetylsalicylic acid.\n\nChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)\n\nStarting dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2 -5 consecutive days\n\nMaintenance doses:\n1 g/kg over 1-2 consecutive days every 3 weeks.\nThe treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after 6 months, \nthe treatment should be discontinued.\nIf the treatment is effective long term treatment should be subject to the physicians discretion based\nupon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to be adapted\naccording to the individual course of the disease.\n\nMultifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)\n\nStarting dose: 2 g/kg given over 2-5 consecutive days.\n\nMaintenance dose: 1 g/kg every 2 to 4 weeks or 2 g/kg every 4 to 8 weeks over 2-5 days.\nThe treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after 6 months, \nthe treatment should be discontinued.\nIf the treatment is effective long term treatment should be subject to the physicians discretion based \nupon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to be adapted\naccording to the individual course of the disease.\n\nThe dose recommendations are summarised in the following table:\n\nIndication Dose Frequency of injections\nReplacement therapy in primary \nimmunodeficiency\n\nstarting dose:\n0.4-0.8 g/kg\n\nmaintenance dose:\n0.2-0.8 g/kg\n\nevery 3-4 weeks to obtain IgG\ntrough level of at least 5-6 g/l\n\nReplacement therapy in secondary \nimmunodeficiency\n\n0.2-0.4 g/kg every 3-4 weeks to obtain IgG\ntrough level of at least 5-6 g/l\n\nImmunomodulation:\n\nPrimary immune thrombocytopenia 0.8-1 g/kg\n\nor\n0.4 g/kg/d\n\non day 1, possibly repeated once \nwithin 3 days\n\nfor 2-5 days\n\nGuillain Barré syndrome 0.4 g/kg/d for 5 days\n\nKawasaki disease 2 g/kg in one dose in association with \nacetylsalicylic acid\n\n\n\n5\n\nChronic inflammatory demyelinating \npolyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)\n\nstarting dose\n2g/kg\n\nmaintenance dose:\n1g/kg\n\nIn divided doses over 2-5 days\n\nevery 3 weeks over 1-2 days\n\nMultifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) starting \ndose: 2 g/kg\n\nmaintenance \ndose: 1 g/kg\n\nor\n2 g/kg\n\ngiven over 2-5 days\n\nevery 2-4 weeks \n\nor\nevery 4-8 weeks over 2-5 days\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe posology in children and adolescents (0-18 years) is not different to that of adults as the \nposology for each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of \nthe above mentioned conditions.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo evidence is available to require a dose adjustment.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nNo dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4.\n\nElderly\n\nNo dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nFor intravenous use.\nHuman normal immunoglobulin should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.5 ml/kg BW/hr \nfor 30 minutes. If well tolerated (see section 4.4), the rate of administration may gradually be \nincreased to a maximum of 6 ml/kg BW/hr. Clinical data obtained from a limited number of patients \nalso indicate that adult PID patients may tolerate an infusion rate of up to 8 ml/kg BW/hr. For further \nprecautions for use see section 4.4.\n\nIf dilution prior to infusion is required, KIOVIG may be diluted with 5% glucose solution to a final \nconcentration of 50 mg/ml (5% immunoglobulin). For instructions on dilution of the medicinal \nproduct before administration, see section 6.6.\n\nAny infusion-related adverse events should be treated by lowering infusion rates or by stopping the \ninfusion.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nHypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, especially in patients with antibodies against IgA.\n\n\n\n6\n\nPatients with selective IgA deficiency who developed antibodies to IgA, as administering an IgA\ncontaining product can result in anaphylaxis.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nInfusion reaction\n\nCertain severe adverse reactions (e.g. headache, flushing, chills, myalgia, wheezing, tachycardia, \nlower back pain, nausea, and hypotension) may be related to the rate of infusion. The recommended \ninfusion rate given under section 4.2 must be closely followed. Patients must be closely monitored and \ncarefully observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion period.\nCertain adverse reactions may occur more frequently\n in case of high rate of infusion\n in patients who receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when \n\nthe human normal immunoglobulin product is switched or when there has been a long interval \nsince the previous infusion.\n\n in patients with an untreated infection or underlying chronic inflammation.\n\nPrecautions for use\n\nPotential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients:\n- are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin by initially injecting the product slowly \n\n(0.5 ml/kg BW/hr);\n- are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients \n\nnaive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative IVIg product or \nwhen there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored at the \nhospital during the first infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion, in order to detect \npotential adverse signs. All other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after \nadministration.\n\nIn all patients, IVIg administration requires:\n adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the infusion of IVIg\n monitoring of urine output\n monitoring of serum creatinine levels\n monitoring for signs and symptoms of thrombosis\n assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity\n avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics (see 4.5).\n\nIn case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped. \nThe treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction.\n\nIf dilution of KIOVIG to lower concentrations is required for patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, \nthe use of 5% glucose solution for dilution may have to be reconsidered.\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nHypersensitivity reactions are rare.\n\nAnaphylaxis can develop in patients\n with undetectable IgA who have anti-IgA antibodies\n who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin\n\nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.\n\n\n\n7\n\nThromboembolism\n\nThere is clinical evidence of an association between IVIg administration and thromboembolic events \nsuch as myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident (including stroke), pulmonary embolism and \ndeep vein thromboses which is assumed to be related to a relative increase in blood viscosity through \nthe high influx of immunoglobulin in at-risk patients. Caution should be exercised in prescribing and \ninfusion of IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events \n(such as a history of atherosclerosis, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, impaired \ncardiac output, hypertension, use of estrogens, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or \nthrombotic episodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, hypercoagulable \ndisorders, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, severely hypovolaemic patients, patients \nwith diseases which increase blood viscosity, patients with indwelling vascular catheters and patients \nwith high dose and rapid infusion).\n\nHyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and subsequent relative pseudohyponatremia may occur \nin patients receiving IVIg therapy. This should be taken into account by physicians, since initiation of\ntreatment for true hyponatremia (i.e. decreasing serum free water) in these patients may lead to \na further increase in serum viscosity and a possible predisposition to thromboembolic events.\n\nIn patients at risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions, IVIg products should be administered at the\nminimum rate of infusion and dose practicable.\n\nAcute renal failure\n\nCases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients receiving IVIg therapy. These include acute \nrenal failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy and osmotic nephrosis. In most \ncases, risk factors have been identified, such as pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, \nhypovolaemia, overweight, concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, age over 65, sepsis, \nhyperviscosity or paraproteinemia.\n\nRenal parameters should be assessed prior to infusion of IVIg, particularly in patients judged to have a \npotential increased risk for developing acute renal failure, and again at appropriate intervals. In \npatients at risk for acute renal failure, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of \ninfusion and dose practicable. In case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation should be considered.\n\nWhile these reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of \nmany of the licensed IVIg products containing various excipients such as sucrose, glucose and \nmaltose, those containing sucrose as a stabiliser accounted for a disproportionate share of the total \nnumber. In patients at risk, the use of IVIg products that do not contain these excipients may be \nconsidered. KIOVIG does not contain sucrose, maltose or glucose.\n\nTransfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)\n\nIn patients receiving IVIg, there have been reports of acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema \n(Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury, (TRALI) in patients administered IVIg (including KIOVIG).\nTRALI is characterised by severe hypoxia, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, cyanosis, fever and hypotension. \nSymptoms of TRALI typically develop during or within 6 hours of a transfusion, often within 1-2 \nhours. Therefore, IVIg recipients must be monitored for and IVIg infusion must be immediately \nstopped in case of pulmonary adverse reactions. TRALI is a potentially lifethreatening condition \nrequiring immediate intensive-care-unit management.\n\nAseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS)\n\nAseptic meningitis syndrome has been reported to occur in association with IVIg treatment. The \nsyndrome usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IVIg treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid \nstudies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm3, predominantly \n\n\n\n8\n\nfrom the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL. AMS may \noccur more frequently in association with high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg treatment.\n\nPatients exhibiting such signs and symptoms should receive a thorough neurological examination,\nincluding CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis.\n\nDiscontinuation of IVIg treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without \nsequelae.\n\nFrom post-marketing data with KIOVIG no clear correlation of AMS to higher doses was observed. \nHigher incidences of AMS were seen in women.\n\nHaemolytic anaemia\n\nIVIg products can contain blood group antibodies that may act as haemolysins and induce in vivo\ncoating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction\n(Coombs' test) and, rarely, haemolysis. Haemolytic anaemia can develop subsequent to IVIg therapy \ndue to enhanced red blood cells (RBC) sequestration. IVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical \nsigns and symptoms of haemolysis. (See section 4.8.)\n\nNeutropenia/Leukopenia\n\nA transient decrease in neutrophil count and/or episodes of neutropenia, sometimes severe, have been\nreported after treatment with IVIgs. This typically occurs within hours or days after IVIg \nadministration and resolves spontaneously within 7 to 14 days.\n\nInterference with serological testing\n\nAfter infusion of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies \nin the patient's blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing.\n\nPassive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D, may interfere with some \nserological tests for red cell antibodies, for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct \nCoombs’ test).\n\nAdministration of KIOVIG can lead to false positive readings in assays that depend on detection of \nbeta-D-glucans for diagnosis of fungal infections. This may persist during the weeks following \ninfusion of the product.\n\nTransmissible agents\n\nKIOVIG is made from human plasma. Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use \nof medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of \nindividual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective \nmanufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products \nprepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infectious \nagents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other \npathogens.\n\nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV, and \nfor the non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19.\n\nThere is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or Parvovirus \nB19 transmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes \nan important contribution to the viral safety.\n\n\n\n9\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere are no paediatric specific risks with regard to any of the above adverse events. Paediatric\npatients may be more susceptible to volume overload (see Section 4.9).\n\n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interactions\n\nLive attenuated virus vaccines\n\nImmunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months \nthe efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After \nadministration of this product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with live \nattenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. \nTherefore patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked.\n\nDilution of KIOVIG with a 5% glucose solution may result in increased blood glucose levels.\n\nLoop diuretics\n\nAvoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe listed interactions apply both to adults and children.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled \nclinical trials and therefore it should only be given with caution to pregnant women and breast-feeding \nmothers. IVIg products have been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly during the third trimester.\nClinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of \npregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are to be expected.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nImmunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may contribute to protecting the neonate from \npathogens which have a mucosal portal of entry. No negative effects on the breastfed newborn/infants \nare anticipated.\n\nFertility\n\nClinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on fertility are to be \nexpected.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nThe ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions associated with \nKIOVIG. Patients who experience adverse reactions during treatment should wait for these to resolve \nbefore driving or operating machines.\n\n\n\n10\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nAdverse reactions such as chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, \narthralgia, low blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally.\n\nRarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated \ncases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous \nadministration.\n\nCases of reversible aseptic meningitis and rare cases of transient cutaneous reactions (including \ncutaneous lupus erythematosus - frequency unknown) have been observed with human normal \nimmunoglobulin. Reversible haemolytic reactions have been observed in patients, especially those \nwith blood groups A, B, and AB. Rarely, haemolytic anaemia requiring transfusion may develop after \nhigh dose IVIg treatment (see also Section 4.4).\n\nIncrease in serum creatinine level and/or acute renal failure have been observed.\n\nVery rarely: Thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, \nand deep vein thromboses.\n\nCases of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe tables presented below are according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). Table 1 shows the adverse reactions from clinical trials and Table 2 shows the \npost-marketing ARs.\n\nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1\nFrequency of Adverse Reactions (ADRs) in clinical studies with KIOVIG\n\nMedDRA\nSystem Organ Class\n\n(SOC)\nAdverse reaction Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations Bronchitis, nasopharyngitis Common\nChronic sinusitis, fungal infection, infection, kidney \ninfection, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, \nurinary tract infection, bacterial urinary tract infection, \nmeningitis aseptic\n\nUncommon\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nAnaemia, lymphadenopathy Common\n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction Uncommon\nEndocrine disorders Thyroid disorder Uncommon\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nDecreased appetite Common\n\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia, anxiety Common\nIrritability Uncommon\n\nNervous system disorders Headache Very common\nDizziness, migraine, paresthesia, hypoesthesia Common\n\n\n\n11\n\nTable 1\nFrequency of Adverse Reactions (ADRs) in clinical studies with KIOVIG\n\nMedDRA\nSystem Organ Class\n\n(SOC)\nAdverse reaction Frequency \n\nAmnesia, dysarthria, dysgeusia, balance disorder, \ntremor\n\nUncommon\n\nEye disorders Conjunctivitis Common\nEye pain, eye swelling Uncommon\n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders\n\nVertigo, fluid in middle ear Uncommon\n\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia Common\nVascular disorders Hypertension Very common\n\nFlushing Common\nPeripheral coldness, phlebitis Uncommon\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nCough, rhinorrhoea, asthma, nasal congestion, \noropharyngeal pain, dyspnea\n\nCommon\n\nOropharyngeal swelling Uncommon\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Very common\n\nDiarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia Common\nAbdominal distension Uncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nRash Very common\nContusion, pruritus, urticaria, dermatitis, erythema Common\nAngioedema, acute urticaria, cold sweat, \nphotosensitivity reaction, night sweats, hyperhidrosis \n\nUncommon\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders\n\nBack pain, arthralgia, pain in extremity, myalgia, \nmuscle spasms, muscular weakness\n\nCommon\n\nMuscle twitching Uncommon\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\nProteinuria Uncommon\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nLocal reactions (e.g. infusion site \npain/swelling/reaction/pruritus), pyrexia, fatigue\n\nVery common\n\nChills, edema, influenza-like illness, chest discomfort, \nchest pain, asthenia, malaise, rigors\n\nCommon\n\nChest tightness, feeling hot, burning sensation, \nswelling\n\nUncommon\n\nInvestigations Blood cholesterol increased, blood creatinine \nincreased, blood urea increased, white blood cell \ncount decreased, alanine aminotransferase increased, \nhaematocrit decreased, red blood cell count decreased, \nrespiratory rate increased\n\nUncommon\n\nTable 2\nPost-Marketing Adverse Reactions (ARs)\n\nMedDRA\nSystem Organ Class \n\n(SOC)\nAdverse reaction Frequency \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nHaemolysis Not known\n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactic shock Not known\nNervous system disorders Transient ischemic attack, cerebral vascular accident Not known\nCardiac disorders Myocardial infarction Not known\nVascular disorders Hypotension, deep vein thrombosis Not known\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nPulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema Not known\n\n\n\n12\n\nTable 2\nPost-Marketing Adverse Reactions (ARs)\n\nMedDRA\nSystem Organ Class \n\n(SOC)\nAdverse reaction Frequency \n\nInvestigations Coombs direct test positive, oxygen saturation \ndecreased\n\nNot known\n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications\n\nTransfusion-related acute lung injury Not known\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nMuscle twitching and weakness were reported only in patients with MMN.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are the same as in adults.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\nFor safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nOverdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity, particularly in patients at risk, including \nelderly patients or patients with cardiac or renal impairment (see section 4.4 ).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nSmaller children below the age of 5 years may be particularly susceptible to volume overload. \nTherefore, dosing should be carefully calculated for this population. In addition, children with \nKawasaki Disease are at especially high risk due to underlying cardiac compromise so dose and rate \nof administration should be carefully controlled.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, \nfor intravascular administration, ATC code: J06BA02\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum \nof antibodies against infectious agents.\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is \nusually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1000 donations. It has a distribution of \nimmunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma. Adequate doses \nof this medicinal product may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G levels to the normal range.\n\nThe mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but \nincludes immunomodulatory effects.\n\n\n\n13\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere are no theoretical or observed differences in the action of immunoglobulins in children \ncompared to adults.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nHuman normal immunoglobulin is immediately and completely bioavailable in the recipient’s \ncirculation after intravenous administration. It is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and \nextravascular fluid; after approximately 3 to 5 days equilibrium is reached between the intra- and \nextravascular compartments.\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters for KIOVIG were determined in the two clinical studies in PID patients \nperformed in Europe and the US. In these studies, a total of 83 subjects at least 2 years of age were \ntreated with doses of 300 to 600 mg/kg body weight every 21 to 28 days for 6 to 12 months. The \nmedian IgG half-life after administration of KIOVIG was 32.5 days. This half-life may vary from \npatient to patient, in particular in primary immunodeficiency. Pharmacokinetic parameters for the \nproduct are summarized in the table below. All parameters were analysed separately for three age \ngroups, children (below 12 years, n=5), adolescents (13 to 17 years, n=10), and adults (above 18 years \nof age, n=64). The values obtained in the studies are comparable to parameters reported for other \nhuman immunoglobulins.\n\nSummary of KIOVIG pharmacokinetic parameters\n\nParameter\nChildren\n\n(12 years or below)\nAdolescents\n\n(13 to 17 years)\nAdults\n\n(18 years or above)\nMedian 95% CI* Median 95% CI Median 95% CI\n\nTerminal half-life (days) 41.3 20.2 to 86.8 45.1 27.3 to 89.3 31.9 29.6 to 36.1\nCmin (mg/dl)/(mg/kg)\n(trough level)\n\n2.28 1.72 to 2.74 2.25 1.98 to 2.64 2.24 1.92 to 2.43\n\nCmax (mg/dl)/(mg/kg)\n(peak level)\n\n4.44 3.30 to 4.90 4.43 3.78 to 5.16 4.50 3.99 to 4.78\n\nIn-vivo recovery (%) 121 87 to 137 99 75 to 121 104 96 to 114\nIncremental recovery \n(mg/dl)/(mg/kg)\n\n2.26 1.70 to 2.60 2.09 1.78 to 2.65 2.17 1.99 to 2.44\n\nAUC0-21d (g·h/dl) \n(area under the curve)\n\n1.49 1.34 to 1.81 1.67 1.45 to 2.19 1.62 1.50 to 1.78\n\n*CI – Confidence Interval\n\nIgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in cells of the reticuloendothelial system.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nImmunoglobulins are normal constituents of the human body.\n\nThe safety of KIOVIG has been demonstrated in several non-clinical studies. Non-clinical data reveal \nno special risk for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and toxicity.\n\nStudies of repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction in animals are \nimpracticable due to induction of and interference by developing antibodies to heterologous proteins. \nSince clinical experience provides no evidence for carcinogenic potential of immunoglobulins, \nno experimental studies in heterogeneous species were performed.\n\n\n\n14\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible\n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What KIOVIG is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use KIOVIG\n3. How to use KIOVIG\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store KIOVIG\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What KIOVIG is and what it is used for\n\nKIOVIG belongs to a class of medications called immunoglobulins. These medicines contain human \nantibodies, which are also present in your blood. Antibodies help your body to fight infections. \nMedicines like KIOVIG are used in patients who do not have enough antibodies in their blood and \ntend to get frequent infections. They can also be used in patients who need additional antibodies for \nthe cure of certain inflammatory disorders (autoimmune diseases).\n\nKIOVIG is used for\n\nTreatment of patients who do not have sufficient antibodies (replacement therapy). There are \ntwo groups:\n\n1. Patients with inborn lack of antibody production (primary immunodeficiency syndromes).\n2. Patients with secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) who suffer from severe or recurrent \n\ninfections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure\n(PSAF)* or serum IgG level of <4 g/l.\n\n*PSAF = failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide \nand polypeptide antigen vaccines\n\nTreatment of patients with certain inflammatory disorders (immunomodulation). There are five\ngroups:\n\n1. Patients who do not have enough blood platelets (primary immune thrombocytopenia, ITP), and \nwho are at high risk of bleeding or will have surgery in the near future.\n\n2. Patients with a disease that is associated with multiple inflammations of the nerves in the whole \nbody (Guillain Barré syndrome).\n\n3. Patients with a disease which results in multiple inflammations of several organs of the \nbody (Kawasaki disease).\n\n4. Patients who suffer from a rare condition characterized by slow progressive asymmetrical \nweakness of limbs without sensory loss (multifocal motor neuropathy, MMN).\n\n\n\n30\n\n5. Patients who suffer from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy\n(CIDP).\n\n2. What you need to know before you use KIOVIG\n\nDo not use KIOVIG\n\nif you are allergic to immunoglobulins or to any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\nFor example, if you have an immunoglobulin A deficiency, you may have antibodies against \nimmunoglobulin A in your blood. Since KIOVIG contains trace amounts of immunoglobulin A \n(less than 0.14 mg/ml), you might get an allergic reaction.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using KIOVIG.\n\nHow long monitoring is required during the infusion\n\n You will be carefully observed during the infusion period with KIOVIG to make sure that you \ndo not suffer a reaction. Your doctor will make sure that the rate at which KIOVIG is infused is \nsuitable for you.\n\n If KIOVIG is administered at a high rate, if you suffer from a condition with low antibody \nlevels in your blood (hypo- or agammaglobulinemia), if you have not received this medicine \nbefore or if there has been a long interval (e.g. several weeks) since you last received it, there \nmay be a higher risk of side effects. In such cases, you will be closely monitored during your \ninfusion and for an hour after your infusion has stopped.\n\n If you have already received KIOVIG previously and received the last treatment recently, then \nyou will only be observed during the infusion and for at least 20 minutes after your infusion.\n\nWhen slowing or stopping the infusion may be required\n\nIn rare cases your body may have previously reacted to specific antibodies and therefore will be \nsensitive to medicines containing antibodies. This may happen particularly if you suffer from \nimmunoglobulin A deficiency. In these rare cases, you may get allergic reactions such as a sudden fall \nin blood pressure or shock even if you have already received treatment with medicines containing\nantibodies in the past.\n\nIf you experience a reaction during the infusion of KIOVIG, tell your doctor immediately. Depending \non your doctor’s decision the rate of infusion can be slowed or the infusion can be stopped altogether.\n\nSpecial patient groups\n\n Your doctor will take special care if you are overweight, elderly, diabetic, or if you suffer from \nhigh blood pressure, low blood volume (hypovolaemia), or problems with your blood vessels \n(vascular diseases). In these conditions, immunoglobulins may increase the risk of cardiac \ninfarction, stroke, lung embolism, or deep vein thrombosis, although only in very rare cases.\nTell your doctor if you are diabetic. Although KIOVIG does not contain sugar, it may be \ndiluted with a special sugar solution (5% glucose), which could affect your blood sugar level.\n\n Your doctor will also take special care if you have or had previously problems with your \nkidneys, or if you receive medicinal products that may harm your kidney (nephrotoxic \nmedicinal products), as there is a very rare chance of acute kidney failure.\nPlease tell your doctor if you have a kidney disorder. Your doctor will choose the appropriate \nintravenous immunoglobulin for you.\n\n\n\n31\n\nInformation on the source material of KIOVIG\n\nKIOVIG is made from human plasma (the liquid part of blood). When medicines are made from \nhuman blood or plasma, a number of measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on \nto patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of \ncarrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of \nvirus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or \nplasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally \nexcluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.\n\nThe measures taken for the manufacture of KIOVIG are considered effective for enveloped viruses \nsuch as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the \nnon-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. KIOVIG also contains certain antibodies that \ncan prevent an infection with hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19.\n\nOther medicines and KIOVIG\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIf you have received a vaccination during the last six weeks and up to three months, the infusion of \nimmunoglobulins like KIOVIG may impair the effect of some live virus vaccines such as measles, \nrubella, mumps and chicken pox. Therefore, after receiving immunoglobulins you may have to wait up\nto 3 months before receiving your live-attenuated vaccine. You may have to wait for up to 1 year after \nreceiving immunoglobulins before you receive your measles vaccine.\n\nEffects on blood tests\n\nKIOVIG contains a wide variety of different antibodies, some of which can affect blood tests. If you \nhave a blood test after receiving KIOVIG, please inform the person taking your blood or your doctor \nthat you have received the medication.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\n\n If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\n No clinical trials have been made with KIOVIG in pregnant or breast-feeding women. However, \nmedicines that contain antibodies have been used in pregnant or breast-feeding women, and it \nhas been shown that there are no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy or the baby to be \nexpected.\n\n If you are breast-feeding and receive KIOVIG, the antibodies of the medicine can also be found \nin the breast milk. Therefore, your baby may be protected from certain infections.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nPatients may experience reactions (for example dizziness or nausea) during the treatment with \nKIOVIG, which might affect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should\nwait until the reactions have disappeared.\n\n3. How to use KIOVIG\n\nKIOVIG is intended for intravenous administration (infusion into a vein). It is given to you by your \ndoctor or nurse. Dose and frequency of the infusion will vary depending on your condition and your \nbody weight.\n\n\n\n32\n\nAt the beginning of your infusion you will receive KIOVIG at a slow rate. Dependent \non how comfortable you are, your doctor may then gradually increase the infusion rate.\n\nUse in children and adolescents\n\nThe same indications, dose and frequency of infusion as for adults apply for children and \nadolescents (age 0 to 18).\n\nIf you use more KIOVIG than you should\n\nIf you get more KIOVIG than you should, your blood may become too thick (hyperviscous).\nThis could particularly happen when you are a patient at risk, e.g. an elderly patient or a patient \nhaving problems with your kidneys. Be sure that you take adequate fluids so you are not \ndehydrated and notify your physician if you are known to have medical problems.\n\n4.

Other routes of administration have not been \nevaluated.\n\n KIOVIG should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.5 ml/kg bodyweight/hour \nfor 30 minutes. If well tolerated, the rate of administration may gradually be increased to a \nmaximum of 6 ml/kg bodyweight/hour. Clinical data obtained from a limited number of patients \nalso indicate that adult PID patients may tolerate an infusion rate of up to 8 ml/kg BW/hr.\n\n If dilution to lower concentrations is required prior to infusion, KIOVIG may be diluted \nwith 5% glucose solution to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml (5% immunoglobulin).\n\n Any infusion-related adverse events should be treated by lowering infusion rates or by stopping \nthe infusion.\n\nSpecial precautions\n\n Any infusion-related adverse events should be treated by lowering the infusion rate or by \nstopping the infusion.\n\n It is recommended that every time KIOVIG is administered, the name and batch number of \nthe product is recorded.\n\nIncompatibilities\n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products.\n\nSpecial precautions for storage\n\n After dilution to lower concentrations, immediate use is recommended. The in-use stability \nof KIOVIG after dilution with a 5% glucose solution to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml \n(5% immunoglobulin) has been demonstrated for 21 days at 2°C to 8°C as well as at 28°C \nto 30°C; however, these studies did not include the microbial contamination and safety aspects.\n\nInstructions for handling and disposal\n\n The product must be brought to room or body temperature before use.\n KIOVIG should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to\n\nadministration. Only clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow solutions are to \nbe administered.
