This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.  \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFlixabi 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial contains 100 mg of infliximab*. After reconstitution, each ml contains 10 mg of infliximab. \n \n* Infliximab is a chimeric human-murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary \n(CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). \n \nWhite powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nFlixabi, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the reduction of signs and symptoms as well as \nthe improvement in physical function in: \n adult patients with active disease when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs \n\n(DMARDs), including methotrexate, has been inadequate. \n adult patients with severe, active and progressive disease not previously treated with methotrexate or \n\nother DMARDs. \nIn these patient populations, a reduction in the rate of the progression of joint damage, as measured by X-ray, \nhas been demonstrated (see section 5.1). \n \nAdult Crohn’s disease \nFlixabi is indicated for: \n treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who have not responded \n\ndespite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or \nwho are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \n\n treatment of fistulising, active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who have not responded despite a full \nand adequate course of therapy with conventional treatment (including antibiotics, drainage and \nimmunosuppressive therapy). \n\n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease \nFlixabi is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn’s disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to \n17 years, who have not responded to conventional therapy including a corticosteroid, an immunomodulator \nand primary nutrition therapy; or who are intolerant to or have contraindications for such therapies. \nInfliximab has been studied only in combination with conventional immunosuppressive therapy. \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \nUlcerative colitis \nFlixabi is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients who \nhave had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-\nMP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \nFlixabi is indicated for treatment of severely active ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents aged 6 to \n17 years, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-MP \nor AZA, or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis \nFlixabi is indicated for treatment of severe, active ankylosing spondylitis, in adult patients who have \nresponded inadequately to conventional therapy. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nFlixabi is indicated for treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the \nresponse to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. \nFlixabi should be administered \n in combination with methotrexate \n or alone in patients who show intolerance to methotrexate or for whom methotrexate is contraindicated. \nInfliximab has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the \nrate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular \nsymmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1). \n \nPsoriasis \nFlixabi is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who failed to \nrespond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including \nciclosporin, methotrexate or psoralen ultra-violet A (PUVA) (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFlixabi treatment is to be initiated and supervised by qualified physicians experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or \npsoriasis. Flixabi should be administered intravenously. Flixabi infusions should be administered by \nqualified healthcare professionals trained to detect any infusion-related issues. Patients treated with Flixabi \nshould be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. \n \nDuring Flixabi treatment, other concomitant therapies, e.g. corticosteroids and immunosuppressants should \nbe optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults (≥ 18 years) \nRheumatoid arthritis \n3 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 3 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks \nafter the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. \n \nFlixabi must be given concomitantly with methotrexate. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. If a \npatient has an inadequate response or loses response after this period, consideration may be given to increase \nthe dose step-wise by approximately 1.5 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 7.5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Alternatively, \nadministration of 3 mg/kg as often as every 4 weeks may be considered. If adequate response is achieved, \npatients should be continued on the selected dose or dose frequency. Continued therapy should be carefully \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nreconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit within the first 12 weeks of treatment \nor after dose adjustment. \n \nModerately to severely active Crohn’s disease \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by an additional 5 mg/kg infusion 2 weeks after the first \ninfusion. If a patient does not respond after 2 doses, no additional treatment with Flixabi should be given. \nAvailable data do not support further Flixabi treatment, in patients not responding within 6 weeks of the \ninitial infusion. \n \nIn responding patients, the alternative strategies for continued treatment are: \n Maintenance: Additional infusion of 5 mg/kg at 6 weeks after the initial dose, followed by infusions \n\nevery 8 weeks or \n Re-administration: Infusion of 5 mg/kg if signs and symptoms of the disease recur (see ‘Re-\n\nadministration’ below and section 4.4). \n \nAlthough comparative data are lacking, limited data in patients who initially responded to 5 mg/kg but who \nlost response indicate that some patients may regain response with dose escalation (see section 5.1). \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit \nafter dose adjustment. \n \nFistulising, active Crohn’s disease \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusions at 2 and 6 weeks after the \nfirst infusion. If a patient does not respond after 3 doses, no additional treatment with Flixabi should be given. \n \nIn responding patients, the alternative strategies for continued treatment are: \n Maintenance: Additional infusions of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks or \n Re-administration: Infusion of 5 mg/kg if signs and symptoms of the disease recur followed by \n\ninfusions of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks (see ‘Re-administration’ below and section 4.4). \n \nAlthough comparative data are lacking, limited data in patients who initially responded to 5 mg/kg but who \nlost response indicate that some patients may regain response with dose escalation (see section 5.1). \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit \nafter dose adjustment. \n \nIn Crohn’s disease, experience with re-administration if signs and symptoms of disease recur is limited and \ncomparative data on the benefit/risk of the alternative strategies for continued treatment are lacking. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks \nafter the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 14 weeks of treatment, i.e. three \ndoses. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic \nbenefit within this time period. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks \nafter the first infusion, then every 6 to 8 weeks. If a patient does not respond by 6 weeks (i.e. after 2 doses), \nno additional treatment with Flixabi should be given. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks \nafter the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. \n \nPsoriasis \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks \nafter the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. If a patient shows no response after 14 weeks (i.e. after \n4 doses), no additional treatment with Flixabi should be given. \n \nRe-administration for Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis \nIf the signs and symptoms of disease recur, Flixabi can be re-administered within 16 weeks following the last \ninfusion. In clinical studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon and have occurred after \ninfliximab-free intervals of less than 1 year (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The safety and efficacy of re-\nadministration after an infliximab-free interval of more than 16 weeks has not been established. This applies \nto both Crohn’s disease patients and rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n \nRe-administration for ulcerative colitis \nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 8 weeks, has not been established (see sections \n4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRe-administration for ankylosing spondylitis \nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 6 to 8 weeks, has not been established (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRe-administration for psoriatic arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 8 weeks, has not been established (see sections \n4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRe-administration for psoriasis \nLimited experience from re-treatment with one single infliximab dose in psoriasis after an interval of \n20 weeks suggests reduced efficacy and a higher incidence of mild to moderate infusion reactions when \ncompared to the initial induction regimen (see section 5.1). \n \nLimited experience from re-treatment following disease flare by a re-induction regimen suggests a higher \nincidence of infusion reactions, including serious ones, when compared to 8-weekly maintenance treatment \n(see section 4.8). \n \nRe-administration across indications \nIn case maintenance therapy is interrupted, and there is a need to restart treatment, use of a re-induction \nregimen is not recommended (see section 4.8). In this situation, Flixabi should be re-initiated as a single dose \nfollowed by the maintenance dose recommendations described above. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly  \nSpecific studies of infliximab in elderly patients have not been conducted. No major age-related differences \nin clearance or volume of distribution were observed in clinical studies. No dose adjustment is required (see \nsection 5.2). For more information about the safety of infliximab in elderly patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \nInfliximab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nCrohn’s disease (6 to 17 years) \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks \nafter the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. Available data do not support further infliximab \ntreatment in children and adolescents not responding within the first 10 weeks of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nSome patients may require a shorter dosing interval to maintain clinical benefit, while for others a longer \ndosing interval may be sufficient. Patients who have had their dose interval shortened to less than 8 weeks \nmay be at greater risk for adverse reactions. Continued therapy with a shortened interval should be carefully \nconsidered in those patients who show no evidence of additional therapeutic benefit after a change in dosing \ninterval. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab have not been studied in children with Crohn’s disease below the age \nof 6 years. Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on \na posology can be made in children younger than 6 years. \n \nUlcerative colitis (6 to 17 years) \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and 6 weeks \nafter the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. Available data do not support further infliximab \ntreatment in paediatric patients not responding within the first 8 weeks of treatment (see section 5.1). \n \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab have not been studied in children with ulcerative colitis below the age \nof 6 years. Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on \na posology can be made in children younger than 6 years. \n \nPsoriasis \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the indication of \npsoriasis have not been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the indications of \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the indication of \njuvenile rheumatoid arthritis have not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8 \nand 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nFlixabi should be administered intravenously over a 2-hour period. All patients administered Flixabi are to \nbe observed for at least 1-2 hours post-infusion for acute infusion-related reactions. Emergency equipment, \nsuch as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and an artificial airway must be available. Patients may be \npre-treated with e.g., an antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol and infusion rate may be slowed \nin order to decrease the risk of infusion-related reactions especially if infusion-related reactions have \noccurred previously (see section 4.4). \n \nShortened infusions across adult indications \nIn carefully selected adult patients who have tolerated at least 3 initial 2-hour infusions of Flixabi (induction \nphase) and are receiving maintenance therapy, consideration may be given to administering subsequent \ninfusions over a period of not less than 1 hour. If an infusion reaction occurs in association with a shortened \ninfusion, a slower infusion rate may be considered for future infusions if treatment is to be continued. \nShortened infusions at doses > 6 mg/kg have not been studied (see section 4.8). \n \nFor preparation and administration instructions, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in section \n6.1. \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \nPatients with tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, abscesses, and opportunistic infections \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfusion reactions and hypersensitivity \nInfliximab has been associated with acute infusion-related reactions, including anaphylactic shock, and \ndelayed hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). \n \nAcute infusion reactions including anaphylactic reactions may develop during (within seconds) or within a \nfew hours following infusion. If acute infusion reactions occur, the infusion must be interrupted immediately. \nEmergency equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and an artificial airway must be \navailable. Patients may be pre-treated with e.g., an antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol to \nprevent mild and transient effects. \nAntibodies to infliximab may develop and have been associated with an increased frequency of infusion \nreactions. A low proportion of the infusion reactions was serious allergic reactions. An association between \ndevelopment of antibodies to infliximab and reduced duration of response has also been observed. \nConcomitant administration of immunomodulators has been associated with lower incidence of antibodies to \ninfliximab and a reduction in the frequency of infusion reactions. The effect of concomitant \nimmunomodulator therapy was more profound in episodically-treated patients than in patients given \nmaintenance therapy. Patients who discontinue immunosuppressants prior to or during infliximab treatment \nare at greater risk of developing these antibodies. Antibodies to infliximab cannot always be detected in \nserum samples. If serious reactions occur, symptomatic treatment must be given and further Flixabi infusions \nmust not be administered (see section 4.8). \n \nIn clinical studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Available data suggest an increased \nrisk for delayed hypersensitivity with increasing infliximab-free interval. Patients should be advised to seek \nimmediate medical advice if they experience any delayed adverse reaction (see section 4.8). If patients are \nre-treated after a prolonged period, they must be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of delayed \nhypersensitivity. \n \nInfections \nPatients must be monitored closely for infections including tuberculosis before, during and after treatment \nwith Flixabi. Because the elimination of infliximab may take up to six months, monitoring should be \ncontinued throughout this period. Further treatment with Flixabi must not be given if a patient develops a \nserious infection or sepsis. \n \nCaution should be exercised when considering the use of Flixabi in patients with chronic infection or a \nhistory of recurrent infections, including concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Patients should be \nadvised of and avoid exposure to potential risk factors for infection as appropriate. \n \nTumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses. \nExperimental data show that TNFα is essential for the clearing of intracellular infections. Clinical experience \nshows that host defence against infection is compromised in some patients treated with infliximab. \n \nIt should be noted that suppression of TNFα may mask symptoms of infection such as fever. Early \nrecognition of atypical clinical presentations of serious infections and of typical clinical presentation of rare \nand unusual infections is critical in order to minimise delays in diagnosis and treatment. \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n \nPatients taking TNF-blockers are more susceptible to serious infections. \nTuberculosis, bacterial infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, invasive fungal, viral, and other \nopportunistic infections have been observed in patients treated with infliximab. Some of these infections \nhave been fatal; the most frequently reported opportunistic infections with a mortality rate of > 5% include \npneumocystosis, candidiasis, listeriosis and aspergillosis. \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Flixabi, should be monitored closely \nand undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Flixabi should be discontinued if a patient \ndevelops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal therapy should be \ninitiated until the infection is controlled. \n \nTuberculosis \nThere have been reports of active tuberculosis in patients receiving infliximab. It should be noted that in the \nmajority of these reports tuberculosis was extrapulmonary, presenting as either local or disseminated disease. \n \nBefore starting treatment with Flixabi, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive (‘latent’) \ntuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history of tuberculosis \nor possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. \nAppropriate screening tests, e.g. tuberculin skin test, chest X-ray, and/or Interferon Gamma Release Assay), \nshould be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the conduct \nof these tests should be recorded in the patient’s reminder card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false \nnegative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Flixabi therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted. In all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of Flixabi therapy should be very \ncarefully considered. \n \nIf inactive (‘latent’) tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with \nantituberculosis therapy before the initiation of Flixabi, and in accordance with local recommendations. \n \nIn patients who have several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis and have a negative test for latent \ntuberculosis, antituberculosis therapy should be considered before the initiation of Flixabi. \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered before the initiation of Flixabi in patients with a \npast history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. \nSome cases of active tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Flixabi during and after \ntreatment for latent tuberculosis. \nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis (e.g. \npersistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after Flixabi treatment. \n \nInvasive fungal infections \nIn patients treated with Flixabi, an invasive fungal infection such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, \npneumocystosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis should be suspected if they develop a \nserious systemic illness, and a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal \ninfections should be consulted at an early stage when investigating these patients. \nInvasive fungal infections may present as disseminated rather than localised disease, and antigen and \nantibody testing may be negative in some patients with active infection. Appropriate empiric antifungal \ntherapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed taking into account both the risk \nfor severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy. \n \nFor patients who have resided in or travelled to regions where invasive fungal infections such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are endemic, the benefits and risks of Flixabi \ntreatment should be carefully considered before initiation of Flixabi therapy. \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \nFistulising Crohn’s disease \nPatients with fistulising Crohn’s disease with acute suppurative fistulas must not initiate Flixabi therapy until \na source for possible infection, specifically abscess, has been excluded (see section 4.3). \n \nHepatitis B (HBV) reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including infliximab, who are \nchronic carriers of this virus. Some cases have had fatal outcome. \n \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Flixabi. For patients who test \npositive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is \nrecommended. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Flixabi should be closely monitored for signs \nand symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of \ntherapy. Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with antiviral therapy in conjunction \nwith TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV \nreactivation, Flixabi should be stopped and effective antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment \nshould be initiated. \n \nHepatobiliary events \nCases of jaundice and non-infectious hepatitis, some with features of autoimmune hepatitis, have been \nobserved in the post-marketing experience of infliximab. Isolated cases of liver failure resulting in liver \ntransplantation or death have occurred. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction should be \nevaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or ALT elevations ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal \ndevelop(s), Flixabi should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of the abnormality should be \nundertaken. \n \nConcurrent administration of TNF-alpha inhibitor and anakinra \nSerious infections and neutropenia were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNFα-blocking agent, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of \nthe nature of the adverse reactions seen with combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNFα-blocking agents. Therefore, the \ncombination of Flixabi and anakinra is not recommended. \n \nConcurrent administration of TNF-alpha inhibitor and abatacept \nIn clinical studies concurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and abatacept has been associated with an \nincreased risk of infections including serious infections compared to TNF-antagonists alone, without \nincreased clinical benefit. The combination of Flixabi and abatacept is not recommended. \n \nConcurrent administration with other biological therapeutics \nThere is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of infliximab with other biological \ntherapeutics used to treat the same conditions as infliximab. The concomitant use of Flixabi with these \nbiologics is not recommended because of the possibility of an increased risk of infection, and other potential \npharmacological interactions. \n \nSwitching between biological DMARDS \nCare should be taken and patients should continue to be monitored when switching from one biologic to \nanother, since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk for adverse reactions, including \ninfection. \n \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all vaccinations in agreement with \ncurrent vaccination guidelines prior to initiating Flixabi therapy. Patients on infliximab may receive \nconcurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nIn a subset of 90 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the ASPIRE study a similar proportion of \npatients in each treatment group (methotrexate plus: placebo [n = 17], 3 mg/kg [n = 27] or 6 mg/kg \ninfliximab [n = 46]) mounted an effective two-fold increase in titers to a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, \nindicating that infliximab did not interfere with T-cell independent humoral immune responses. However, \nstudies from the published literature in various indications (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn’s \ndisease) suggest that non-live vaccinations received during treatment with anti-TNF therapies, including \ninfliximab, may elicit a lower immune response than in patients not receiving anti-TNF therapy. \n \nLive vaccines/therapeutic infectious agents \nIn patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, limited data are available on the response to vaccination with live \nvaccines or on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines. Use of live vaccines can result in \nclinical infections, including disseminated infections. The concurrent administration of live vaccines with \nFlixabi is not recommended. \n \nIn infants exposed in utero to infliximab, fatal outcome due to disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) \ninfection has been reported following administration of BCG vaccine after birth. At least a six month waiting \nperiod following birth is recommended before the administration of live vaccines to infants exposed in utero \nto infliximab (see section 4.6). \n \nOther uses of therapeutic infectious agents such as live attenuated bacteria (e.g., BCG bladder instillation for \nthe treatment of cancer) could result in clinical infections, including disseminated infections. It is \nrecommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with Flixabi. \n \nAutoimmune processes \nThe relative deficiency of TNFα caused by anti-TNF therapy may result in the initiation of an autoimmune \nprocess. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with \nFlixabi and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Flixabi must not \nbe given (see section 4.8). \n \nNeurological events \nUse of TNF-blocking agents, including infliximab, has been associated with cases of new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating \ndisorders, including multiple sclerosis, and peripheral demyelinating disorders, including Guillain-Barré \nsyndrome. In patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disorders, the benefits and risks of \nanti-TNF treatment should be carefully considered before initiation of Flixabi therapy. Discontinuation of \nFlixabi should be considered if these disorders develop. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nIn the controlled portions of clinical studies of TNF-blocking agents, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF blocker compared with control patients. \nDuring clinical studies of infliximab across all approved indications the incidence of lymphoma in \ninfliximab-treated patients was higher than expected in the general population, but the occurrence of \nlymphoma was rare. In the post-marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in patients treated \nwith a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid \narthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation. \n \nIn an exploratory clinical study evaluating the use of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies were reported in infliximab-treated patients \ncompared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking. Caution should be exercised in \nconsidering treatment of patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking. \n \nWith the current knowledge, a risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients \ntreated with a TNF-blocking agent cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). Caution should be exercised when \nconsidering TNF-blocking therapy for patients with a history of malignancy or when considering continuing \ntreatment in patients who develop a malignancy. \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \nCaution should also be exercised in patients with psoriasis and a medical history of extensive \nimmunosuppressant therapy or prolonged PUVA treatment. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 years \nof age) treated with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including infliximab in the \npost-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety \nof different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression. A risk \nfor the development of malignancies in patients treated with TNF-blockers cannot be excluded. \n \nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated \nwith TNF-blocking agents including infliximab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive \ndisease course and is usually fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with AZA or 6-MP \nconcomitantly with or immediately prior to a TNF-blocker. The vast majority of infliximab cases have \noccurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were reported in adolescent or young \nadult males. The potential risk with the combination of AZA or 6-MP and Flixabi should be carefully \nconsidered. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Flixabi \ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nMelanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF blocker therapy, \nincluding infliximab (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended, particularly for patients \nwith risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nA population-based retrospective cohort study using data from Swedish national health registries found an \nincreased incidence of cervical cancer in women with rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab compared \nto biologics-naïve patients or the general population, including those over 60 years of age. Periodic screening \nshould continue in women treated with infliximab, including those over 60 years of age. \n \nAll patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma (for example, \npatients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had a prior history of \ndysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and \nthroughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per local \nrecommendations. Current data do not indicate that infliximab treatment influences the risk for developing \ndysplasia or colon cancer. \n \nSince the possibility of increased risk of cancer development in patients with newly diagnosed dysplasia \ntreated with infliximab is not established, the risk and benefits of continued therapy to the individual patients \nshould be carefully considered by the clinician. \n \nHeart failure \nFlixabi should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Patients should be \nclosely monitored and Flixabi must not be continued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of \nheart failure (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nHaematologic reactions \nThere have been reports of pancytopenia, leucopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia in patients \nreceiving TNF-blockers, including infliximab. All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical \nattention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent fever, bruising, \nbleeding, pallor). Discontinuation of Flixabi therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed \nsignificant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nOthers \nThere is limited safety experience of infliximab treatment in patients who have undergone surgical \nprocedures, including arthroplasty. The long half-life of infliximab should be taken into consideration if a \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nsurgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on Flixabi should be closely monitored \nfor infections, and appropriate actions should be taken. \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of a fixed fibrotic stricture that \nmay require surgical treatment. There is no evidence to suggest that infliximab worsens or causes fibrotic \nstrictures. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe incidence of serious infections in infliximab-treated patients 65 years and older was greater than in those \nunder 65 years of age. Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention regarding the risk for infection \nshould be paid when treating the elderly (see section 4.8). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInfections \nIn clinical studies, infections have been reported in a higher proportion of paediatric patients compared to \nadult patients (see section 4.8). \n \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all vaccinations in \nagreement with current vaccination guidelines prior to initiating Flixabi therapy. Paediatric patients on \ninfliximab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 years \nof age) treated with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including infliximab in the \npost-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases represented a variety \nof different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression. A risk \nfor the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with TNF-blockers cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF-\nblocking agents including infliximab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease \ncourse and is usually fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with AZA or \n6-MP concomitantly with or immediately prior to a TNF-blocker. The vast majority of infliximab cases have \noccurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were reported in adolescent or young \nadult males. The potential risk with the combination of AZA or 6-MP and Flixabi should be carefully \nconsidered. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Flixabi \ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nSodium content \nFlixabi contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. Flixabi is however, \ndiluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. This should be taken into consideration for \npatients on a controlled sodium diet (see section 6.6). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease patients, there are indications that concomitant \nuse of methotrexate and other immunomodulators reduces the formation of antibodies against infliximab and \nincreases the plasma concentrations of infliximab. However, the results are uncertain due to limitations in the \nmethods used for serum analyses of infliximab and antibodies against infliximab. \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \nCorticosteroids do not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of infliximab to a clinically relevant extent. \n \nThe combination of Flixabi with other biological therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as Flixabi, \nincluding anakinra and abatacept, is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nIt is recommended that live vaccines not be given concurrently with Flixabi. It is also recommended that live \nvaccines not be given to infants after in utero exposure to infliximab for at least 6 months following birth \n(see section 4.4). \n \nIt is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with Flixabi (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least 6 months after the last Flixabi treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThe moderate number of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to infliximab resulting in live birth \nwith known outcomes, including approximately 1100 exposed during the first trimester, does not indicate an \nincrease in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nBased on an observational study from Northern Europe, an increased risk (OR, 95% CI; p-value) for C-\nsection (1.50, 1.14-1.96; p=0.0032), preterm birth (1.48, 1.05-2.09; p=0.024), small for gestational age (2.79, \n1.54-5.04; p=0.0007), and low birth weight (2.03, 1.41-2.94; p=0.0002) was observed in women exposed \nduring pregnancy to infliximab (with or without immunomodulators/corticosteroids, 270 pregnancies) as \ncompared to women exposed to immunomodulators and/or corticosteroids only (6,460 pregnancies). The \npotential contribution of exposure to inflixumab and/or the severity of the underlying disease in these \noutcomes remains unclear. \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNFα, infliximab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn. In a developmental toxicity study conducted in mice using an analogous antibody \nthat selectively inhibits the functional activity of mouse TNFα, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThe available clinical experience is limited. Infliximab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly \nneeded. \n \nInfliximab crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants up to 6 months following birth. \nAfter in utero exposure to infliximab, infants may be at increased risk of infection, including serious \ndisseminated infection that can become fatal. Administration of live vaccines (e.g. BCG vaccine) to infants \nexposed to infliximab in utero is not recommended for at least 6 months after birth (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nCases of agranulocytosis have also been reported (see section 4.8). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether infliximab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. \nBecause human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast-feed for at least 6 months \nafter Flixabi treatment. \n \nFertility \nThere are insufficient preclinical data to draw conclusions on the effects of infliximab on fertility and general \nreproductive function (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFlixabi may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur following \nadministration of Flixabi (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nUpper respiratory tract infection was the most common adverse drug reaction (ADR) reported in clinical \ntrials, occurring in 25.3% of infliximab-treated patients compared with 16.5% of control patients. The most \nserious ADRs associated with the use of TNF blockers that have been reported for infliximab include HBV \nreactivation, CHF (congestive heart failure), serious infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and \nTB), serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity reactions), haematologic reactions, systemic lupus \nerythematosus/lupus-like syndrome, demyelinating disorders, hepatobiliary events, lymphoma, HSTCL, \nleukaemia, Merkel cell carcinoma, melanoma, paediatric malignancy, sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reaction, \nintestinal or perianal abscess (in Crohn’s disease), and serious infusion reactions (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 lists ADRs based on experience from clinical studies as well as adverse reactions, some with fatal \noutcome, reported from post-marketing experience. Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are \nlisted under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 \nto < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n \n\nTable 1 \nUndesirable effects in clinical studies and from post-marketing experience

4.4 \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nInfusion-related reactions \nAn infusion-related reaction was defined in clinical studies as any adverse event occurring during an infusion \nor within 1 hour after an infusion. In Phase III clinical studies, 18% of infliximab-treated patients compared \nwith 5% of placebo-treated patients experienced an infusion-related reaction. Overall, a higher proportion of \npatients receiving infliximab monotherapy experienced an infusion-related reaction compared to patients \nreceiving infliximab with concomitant immunomodulators. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued \ntreatment due to infusion-related reactions and all patients recovered with or without medical therapy. Of \ninfliximab-treated patients who had an infusion reaction during the induction period, through week 6, 27% \nexperienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period, week 7 through week 54. Of patients who \ndid not have an infusion reaction during the induction period, 9% experienced an infusion reaction during the \nmaintenance period. \n \nIn a clinical study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ASPIRE), infusions were to be administered over \n2 hours for the first 3 infusions. The duration of subsequent infusions could be shortened to not less than \n40 minutes in patients who did not experience serious infusion reactions. In this trial, sixty six percent of the \npatients (686 out of 1,040) received at least one shortened infusion of 90 minutes or less and 44% of the \npatients (454 out of 1,040) received at least one shortened infusion of 60 minutes or less. Of the infliximab-\ntreated patients who received at least one shortened infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 15% of \npatients and serious infusion reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients. \n \nIn a clinical study of patients with Crohn’s disease (SONIC), infusion-related reactions occurred in \n16.6% (27/163) of patients receiving infliximab monotherapy, 5% (9/179) of patients receiving infliximab in \ncombination with AZA, and 5.6% (9/161) of patients receiving AZA monotherapy. One serious infusion \nreaction (< 1%) occurred in a patient on infliximab monotherapy. \n \nIn post-marketing experience, cases of anaphylactic-like reactions, including laryngeal/pharyngeal oedema \nand severe bronchospasm, and seizure have been associated with infliximab administration (see section 4.4). \nCases of transient visual loss occurring during or within 2 hours of infliximab infusion have been reported. \nEvents (some fatal) of myocardial ischaemia/infarction and arrhythmia have been reported, some in close \ntemporal association with infusion of infliximab; cerebrovascular accidents have also been reported in close \ntemporal association with infusion of infliximab. \n \nInfusion reactions following re-administration of infliximab \nA clinical study in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis was designed to assess the efficacy and safety \nof long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of infliximab (maximum of \nfour infusions at 0, 2, 6 and 14 weeks) following disease flare. Patients did not receive any concomitant \nimmunosuppressant therapy. In the re-treatment arm, 4% (8/219) of patients experienced a serious infusion \nreaction versus < 1% (1/222) on maintenance therapy. The majority of serious infusion reactions occurred \nduring the second infusion at week 2. The interval between the last maintenance dose and the first re-\ninduction dose ranged from 35-231 days. Symptoms included, but were not limited to, dyspnoea, urticaria, \nfacial oedema, and hypotension. In all cases, infliximab treatment was discontinued and/or other treatment \ninstituted with complete resolution of signs and symptoms. \n \nDelayed hypersensitivity \nIn clinical studies delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon and have occurred after \ninfliximab-free intervals of less than 1 year. In the psoriasis studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions \noccurred early in the treatment course. Signs and symptoms included myalgia and/or arthralgia with fever \nand/or rash, with some patients experiencing pruritus, facial, hand or lip oedema, dysphagia, urticaria, sore \nthroat and headache. \n \nThere are insufficient data on the incidence of delayed hypersensitivity reactions after infliximab-free \nintervals of more than 1 year but limited data from clinical studies suggest an increased risk for delayed \nhypersensitivity with increasing infliximab-free interval (see section 4.4). \nIn a 1-year clinical study with repeated infusions in patients with Crohn's disease (ACCENT I study), the \nincidence of serum sickness-like reactions was 2.4%. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \nImmunogenicity \nPatients who developed antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately 2-3 fold) to develop \ninfusion-related reactions. Use of concomitant immunosuppressant agents appeared to reduce the frequency \nof infusion-related reactions. \nIn clinical studies using single and multiple infliximab doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg, antibodies to \ninfliximab were detected in 14% of patients with any immunosuppressant therapy, and in 24% of patients \nwithout immunosuppressant therapy. In rheumatoid arthritis patients who received the recommended \nrepeated treatment dose regimens with methotrexate, 8% of patients developed antibodies to infliximab. In \npsoriatic arthritis patients who received 5 mg/kg with and without methotrexate, antibodies occurred overall \nin 15% of patients (antibodies occurred in 4% of patients receiving methotrexate and in 26% of patients not \nreceiving methotrexate at baseline). In Crohn's disease patients who received maintenance treatment, \nantibodies to infliximab occurred overall in 3.3% of patients receiving immunosuppressants and in 13.3% of \npatients not receiving immunosuppressants. The antibody incidence was 2-3 fold higher for patients treated \nepisodically. Due to methodological limitations, a negative assay did not exclude the presence of antibodies \nto infliximab. Some patients who developed high titres of antibodies to infliximab had evidence of reduced \nefficacy. In psoriasis patients treated with infliximab as a maintenance regimen in the absence of \nconcomitant immunomodulators, approximately 28% developed antibodies to infliximab (see section 4.4: \n“Infusion reactions and hypersensitivity”). \n \nInfections \nTuberculosis, bacterial infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, invasive fungal, viral, and other \nopportunistic infections have been observed in patients receiving infliximab. Some of these infections have \nbeen fatal; the most frequently reported opportunistic infections with a mortality rate of > 5% include \npneumocystosis, candidiasis, listeriosis and aspergillosis (see section 4.4). \n \nIn clinical studies 36% of infliximab-treated patients were treated for infections compared with 25% of \nplacebo-treated patients. \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, the incidence of serious infections including pneumonia was higher in \ninfliximab plus methotrexate-treated patients compared with methotrexate alone especially at doses of \n6 mg/kg or greater (see section 4.4). \n \nIn post-marketing spontaneous reporting, infections are the most common serious adverse reaction. Some of \nthe cases have resulted in a fatal outcome. Nearly 50% of reported deaths have been associated with \ninfection. Cases of tuberculosis, sometimes fatal, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-\npulmonary location have been reported (see section 4.4). \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nIn clinical studies with infliximab in which 5,780 patients were treated, representing 5,494 patient years, \n5 cases of lymphomas and 26 non-lymphoma malignancies were detected as compared with no lymphomas \nand 1 non-lymphoma malignancy in 1,600 placebo-treated patients representing 941 patient years. \n \nIn long-term safety follow-up of clinical studies with infliximab of up to 5 years, representing 6,234 patients-\nyears (3,210 patients), 5 cases of lymphoma and 38 cases of non-lymphoma malignancies were reported. \n \nCases of malignancies, including lymphoma, have also been reported in the post-marketing setting (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical study involving patients with moderate to severe COPD who were either current \nsmokers or ex-smokers, 157 adult patients were treated with infliximab at doses similar to those used in \nrheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Nine of these patients developed malignancies, including \n1 lymphoma. The median duration of follow-up was 0.8 years (incidence 5.7% [95% CI 2.65%-10.6%]. \nThere was one reported malignancy amongst 77 control patients (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nincidence 1.3% [95% CI 0.03%-7.0%]). The majority of the malignancies developed in the lung or head and \nneck. \n \nA population-based retrospective cohort study found an increased incidence of cervical cancer in women \nwith rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab compared to biologics-naïve patients or the general \npopulation, including those over 60 years of age (see section 4.4). \n \nIn addition, post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \nwith infliximab with the vast majority of cases occurring in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and most \nof whom were adolescent or young adult males (see section 4.4). \n \nHeart failure \nIn a Phase II study aimed at evaluating infliximab in CHF, higher incidence of mortality due to worsening of \nheart failure were seen in patients treated with infliximab, especially those treated with the higher dose of 10 \nmg/kg (i.e. twice the maximum approved dose). In this study 150 patients with NYHA Class III-IV CHF \n(left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%) were treated with 3 infusions of infliximab 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or \nplacebo over 6 weeks. At 38 weeks, 9 of 101 patients treated with infliximab (2 at 5 mg/kg and 7 at 10 \nmg/kg) died compared to one death among the 49 patients on placebo. \nThere have been post-marketing reports of worsening heart failure, with and without identifiable \nprecipitating factors, in patients taking infliximab. There have also been post-marketing reports of new onset \nheart failure, including heart failure in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of \nthese patients have been under 50 years of age. \n \nHepatobiliary events \nIn clinical studies, mild or moderate elevations of ALT and AST have been observed in patients receiving \ninfliximab without progression to severe hepatic injury. Elevations of ALT ≥ 5 x Upper Limit of Normal \n(ULN) have been observed (see Table 2). Elevations of aminotransferases were observed (ALT more \ncommon than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving infliximab than in controls, both when \ninfliximab was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination with other immunosuppressive \nagents. Most aminotransferase abnormalities were transient; however, a small number of patients \nexperienced more prolonged elevations. In general, patients who developed ALT and AST elevations were \nasymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of \ninfliximab, or modification of concomitant therapy. In post-marketing surveillance, cases of jaundice and \nhepatitis, some with features of autoimmune hepatitis, have been reported in patients receiving infliximab \n(see section 4.4). \n \n \n\nTable 2 \nProportion of patients with increased ALT activity in clinical studies \n\nIndication Number of patients\n3 Median follow-up (wks)4 ≥ 3 x ULN ≥ 5 x ULN \n\nplacebo infliximab placebo infliximab placebo infliximab placebo infliximab \nRheumatoid \narthritis1 375 1,087 58.1 58.3 3.2% 3.9% 0.8% 0.9% \n\nCrohn’s \ndisease2 324 1034 53.7 54.0 2.2% 4.9% 0.0% 1.5% \n\nPaediatric \nCrohn’s \ndisease \n\nN/A 139 N/A 53.0 N/A 4.4% N/A 1.5% \n\nUlcerative \ncolitis 242 482 30.1 30.8 1.2% 2.5% 0.4% 0.6% \n\nPaediatric \nUlcerative \ncolitis \n\nN/A 60 N/A 49.4 N/A 6.7% N/A 1.7% \n\nAnkylosing \nspondylitis 76 275 24.1 101.9 0.0% 9.5% 0.0% 3.6% \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nIndication Number of patients\n3 Median follow-up (wks)4 ≥ 3 x ULN ≥ 5 x ULN \n\nplacebo infliximab placebo infliximab placebo infliximab placebo infliximab \nPsoriatic \narthritis 98 191 18.1 39.1 0.0% 6.8% 0.0% 2.1% \n\nPlaque \npsoriasis 281 1,175 16.1 50.1 0.4% 7.7% 0.0% 3.4% \n1 Placebo patients received methotrexate while infliximab patients received both infliximab and methotrexate.  \n2 Placebo patients in the 2 Phase III studies in Crohn’s disease, ACCENT I and ACCENT II, received an initial dose of 5 mg/kg \ninfliximab at study start and were on placebo in the maintenance phase. Patients who were randomised to the placebo maintenance \ngroup and then later crossed over to infliximab are included in the infliximab group in the ALT analysis. In the Phase IIIb trial in \nCrohn’s disease, SONIC, placebo patients received AZA 2.5 mg/kg/day as active control in addition to placebo infliximab infusions.  \n3 Number of patients evaluated for ALT.  \n4 Median follow-up is based on patients treated. \n \n \nAntinuclear antibodies (ANA)/Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies \nApproximately half of infliximab-treated patients in clinical studies who were ANA negative at baseline \ndeveloped a positive ANA during the study compared with approximately one fifth of placebo-treated \npatients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were newly detected in approximately 17% of infliximab-treated patients \ncompared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. At the last evaluation, 57% of infliximab-treated patients \nremained anti-dsDNA positive. Reports of lupus and lupus-like syndromes, however, remain uncommon (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients \nInfliximab was studied in a clinical study in 120 patients (age range: 4-17 years old) with active juvenile \nrheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate. Patients received 3 or 6 mg/kg infliximab as a 3-dose induction \nregimen (weeks 0, 2, 6 or weeks 14, 16, 20, respectively) followed by maintenance therapy every 8 weeks, in \ncombination with methotrexate. \n \nInfusion reactions \nInfusion reactions occurred in 35% of patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis receiving 3 mg/kg \ncompared with 17.5% of patients receiving 6 mg/kg. In the 3 mg/kg infliximab group, 4 out of 60 patients \nhad a serious infusion reaction and 3 patients reported a possible anaphylactic reaction (2 of which were \namong the serious infusion reactions). In the 6 mg/kg group, 2 out of 57 patients had a serious infusion \nreaction, one of whom had a possible anaphylactic reaction (see section 4.4). \n \nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies to infliximab developed in 38% of patients receiving 3 mg/kg compared with 12% of patients \nreceiving 6 mg/kg. The antibody titres were notably higher for the 3 mg/kg compared to the 6 mg/kg group. \n \nInfections \nInfections occurred in 68% (41/60) of children receiving 3 mg/kg over 52 weeks, 65% (37/57) of children \nreceiving infliximab 6 mg/kg over 38 weeks and 47% (28/60) of children receiving placebo over 14 weeks \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease patients \nThe following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in paediatric Crohn’s disease patients in the \nREACH study (see section 5.1) than in adult Crohn’s disease patients: anaemia (10.7%), blood in stool \n(9.7%), leucopenia (8.7%), flushing (8.7%), viral infection (7.8%), neutropenia (6.8%), bacterial infection \n(5.8%), and respiratory tract allergic reaction (5.8%). In addition, bone fracture (6.8%) was reported, \nhowever, a causal association has not been established. Other special considerations are discussed below. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nIn REACH, 17.5% of randomised patients experienced 1 or more infusion reactions. There were no serious \ninfusion reactions, and 2 subjects in REACH had non-serious anaphylactic reactions. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies to infliximab were detected in 3 (2.9%) paediatric patients. \n \nInfections \nIn the REACH study, infections were reported in 56.3% of randomised subjects treated with infliximab. \nInfections were reported more frequently for subjects who received q8 week as opposed to q12 week \ninfusions (73.6% and 38.0%, respectively), while serious infections were reported for 3 subjects in the \nq8 week and 4 subjects in the q12 week maintenance treatment group. The most commonly reported \ninfections were upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, and the most commonly reported serious \ninfection was abscess. Three cases of pneumonia (1 serious) and 2 cases of herpes zoster (both non-serious) \nwere reported. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis patients \nOverall, the adverse reactions reported in the paediatric ulcerative colitis trial (C0168T72) and adult \nulcerative colitis (ACT 1 and ACT 2) studies were generally consistent. In C0168T72, the most common \nadverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, fever, and headache. \nThe most common adverse event was worsening of ulcerative colitis, the incidence of which was higher in \npatients on the q12 week vs. the q8 week dosing regimen. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nOverall, 8 (13.3%) of 60 treated patients experienced one or more infusion reactions, with 4 of 22 (18.2%) in \nthe q8 week and 3 of 23 (13.0%) in the q12 week treatment maintenance group. No serious infusion \nreactions were reported. All infusion reactions were mild or moderate in intensity. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies to infliximab were detected in 4 (7.7%) patients through week 54. \n \nInfections \nInfections were reported in 31 (51.7%) of 60 treated patients in C0168T72 and 22 (36.7%) required oral or \nparenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients with infections in C0168T72 was similar to \nthat in the paediatric Crohn’s disease study (REACH) but higher than the proportion in the adults ulcerative \ncolitis studies (ACT 1 and ACT 2). The overall incidence of infections in C0168T72 was 13/22 (59%) in the \nevery 8 week maintenance treatment group and 14/23 (60.9%) in the every 12 week maintenance treatment \ngroup. Upper respiratory tract infection (7/60 [12%]) and pharyngitis (5/60 [8%]) were the most frequently \nreported respiratory system infections. Serious infections were reported in 12% (7/60) of all treated patients. \n \nIn this study, there were more patients in the 12 to 17 year age group than in the 6 to 11 year age group \n(45/60 [75.0%]) vs.15/60 [25.0%]). While the numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to make \nany definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events, there were higher proportions of patients \nwith serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events in the younger age group than in the \nolder age group. While the proportion of patients with infections was also higher in the younger age group, \nfor serious infections, the proportions were similar in the two age groups. Overall proportions of adverse \nevents and infusion reactions were similar between the 6 to 11 and 12 to 17 year age groups. \n \nPost-marketing experience \nPost-marketing spontaneous serious adverse reactions with infliximab in the paediatric population have \nincluded malignancies including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas, transient hepatic enzyme abnormalities, \nlupus-like syndromes, and positive auto-antibodies (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nAdditional information on special populations \nElderly \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, the incidence of serious infections was greater in infliximab plus \nmethotrexate-treated patients 65 years and older (11.3%) than in those under 65 years of age (4.6%). In \npatients treated with methotrexate alone, the incidence of serious infections was 5.2% in patients 65 years \nand older compared to 2.7% in patients under 65 (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of  suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the  national  reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. Single doses up to 20 mg/kg have been administered without toxic \neffects. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors, ATC \ncode: L04AB02. \n \nFlixabi is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European \nMedicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \nInfliximab is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both soluble and \ntransmembrane forms of TNFα but not to lymphotoxin α (TNFβ). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nInfliximab inhibits the functional activity of TNFα in a wide variety of in vitro bioassays. Infliximab \nprevented disease in transgenic mice that develop polyarthritis as a result of constitutive expression of human \nTNFα and when administered after disease onset, it allowed eroded joints to heal. In vivo, infliximab rapidly \nforms stable complexes with human TNFα, a process that parallels the loss of TNFα bioactivity. \n \nElevated concentrations of TNFα have been found in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients and correlate \nwith elevated disease activity. In rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with infliximab reduced infiltration of \ninflammatory cells into inflamed areas of the joint as well as expression of molecules mediating cellular \nadhesion, chemoattraction and tissue degradation. After infliximab treatment, patients exhibited decreased \nlevels of serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased haemoglobin levels in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients with reduced haemoglobin levels, compared with baseline. Peripheral blood \nlymphocytes further showed no significant decrease in number or in proliferative responses to in vitro \nmitogenic stimulation when compared with untreated patients’ cells. In psoriasis patients, treatment with \ninfliximab resulted in decreases in epidermal inflammation and normalisation of keratinocyte differentiation \nin psoriatic plaques. In psoriatic arthritis, short term treatment with infliximab reduced the number of T-cells \nand blood vessels in the synovium and psoriatic skin. \n \nHistological evaluation of colonic biopsies, obtained before and 4 weeks after administration of infliximab, \nrevealed a substantial reduction in detectable TNFα. Infliximab treatment of Crohn’s disease patients was \nalso associated with a substantial reduction of the commonly elevated serum inflammatory marker, CRP. \nTotal peripheral white blood cell counts were minimally affected in infliximab-treated patients, although \nchanges in lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils reflected shifts towards normal ranges. Peripheral blood \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23 \n \n\nmononuclear cells (PBMC) from infliximab-treated patients showed undiminished proliferative \nresponsiveness to stimuli compared with untreated patients, and no substantial changes in cytokine \nproduction by stimulated PBMC were observed following treatment with infliximab. Analysis of lamina \npropria mononuclear cells obtained by biopsy of the intestinal mucosa showed that infliximab treatment \ncaused a reduction in the number of cells capable of expressing TNFα and interferon γ. Additional \nhistological studies provided evidence that treatment with infliximab reduces the infiltration of inflammatory \ncells into affected areas of the intestine and the presence of inflammation markers at these sites. Endoscopic \nstudies of intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in infliximab-treated patients.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nAdult rheumatoid arthritis \nThe efficacy of infliximab was assessed in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, pivotal clinical \nstudies: ATTRACT and ASPIRE. In both studies concurrent use of stable doses of folic acid, oral \ncorticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day) and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was permitted. \n \nThe primary endpoints were the reduction of signs and symptoms as assessed by the American College of \nRheumatology criteria (ACR20 for ATTRACT, landmark ACR-N for ASPIRE), the prevention of structural \njoint damage, and the improvement in physical function. A reduction in signs and symptoms was defined to \nbe at least a 20% improvement (ACR20) in both tender and swollen joint counts, and in 3 of the following \n5 criteria: (1) evaluator’s global assessment, (2) patient’s global assessment, (3) functional/disability measure, \n(4) visual analogue pain scale and (5) erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. ACR-N uses the \nsame criteria as the ACR20, calculated by taking the lowest percent improvement in swollen joint count, \ntender joint count, and the median of the remaining 5 components of the ACR response. Structural joint \ndamage (erosions and joint space narrowing) in both hands and feet was measured by the change from \nbaseline in the total van der Heijde-modified Sharp score (0-440). The Health Assessment Questionnaire \n(HAQ; scale 0-3) was used to measure patients’ average change from baseline scores over time, in physical \nfunction. \n \nThe ATTRACT study evaluated responses at 30, 54 and 102 weeks in a placebo-controlled study of \n428 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate. Approximately 50% of \npatients were in functional Class III. Patients received placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2 \nand 6, and then every 4 or 8 weeks thereafter. All patients were on stable methotrexate doses (median \n15 mg/wk) for 6 months prior to enrolment and were to remain on stable doses throughout the study. \nResults from week 54 (ACR20, total van der Heijde-modified Sharp score and HAQ) are shown in Table 3. \nHigher degrees of clinical response (ACR50 and ACR70) were observed in all infliximab groups at 30 and \n54 weeks compared with methotrexate alone. \n \nA reduction in the rate of the progression of structural joint damage (erosions and joint space narrowing) was \nobserved in all infliximab groups at 54 weeks (Table 3). \n \nThe effects observed at 54 weeks were maintained through 102 weeks. Due to a number of treatment \nwithdrawals, the magnitude of the effect difference between infliximab and the methotrexate alone group \ncannot be defined. \n \n\nTable 3 \nEffects on ACR20, Structural Joint Damage and Physical Function at week 54, ATTRACT \n\n Infliximabb \n\n \nControla 3 mg/kg q 8 wks \n\n3 mg/kg \nq 4 wks \n\n10 mg/kg \nq 8 wks \n\n10 mg/kg  \nq 4 wks \n\nAll \ninfliximabb \n\nPatients with ACR20 response/ \nPatients evaluated (%) \n\n15/88 \n(17%) \n\n36/86 \n(42%) \n\n41/86 \n(48%) \n\n51/87 \n(59%) \n\n48/81 \n(59%) \n\n176/340 \n(52%) \n\n \nTotal scored (van der \nHeijde-modified Sharp score) \n\n      \n\nChange from baseline (Mean ± SDc) 7.0 ± 10.3 1.3 ± 6.0 1.6 ± 8.5 0.2 ± 3.6 -0.7 ± 3.8 0.6 ± 5.9 \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n Infliximabb \n\n \nControla 3 mg/kg q 8 wks \n\n3 mg/kg \nq 4 wks \n\n10 mg/kg \nq 8 wks \n\n10 mg/kg  \nq 4 wks \n\nAll \ninfliximabb \n\nMedian \n(Interquartile range) \n\n4.0  \n(0.5,9.7) \n\n0.5 \n(-1.5,3.0) \n\n0.1 \n(-2.5,3.0) \n\n0.5 \n(-1.5,2.0) \n\n-0.5 \n(-3.0,1.5) \n\n0.0 \n(-1.8,2.0) \n\nPatients with no deterioration/patients \nevaluated (%)c \n\n13/64 (20%) 34/71 (48%) 35/71 (49%) 37/77 (48%) 44/66 (67%) 150/285 (53%) \n \nHAQ change from baseline over \ntimee (patients evaluated) 87 86 85 87 81 339 \n\nMean ± SDc 0.2 ± 0.3 0.4 ± 0.3 0.5 ± 0.4 0.5 ± 0.5 0.4 ± 0.4 0.4 ± 0.4 \na control = All patients had active RA despite treatment with stable methotrexate doses for 6 months prior to enrolment and were to \nremain on stable doses throughout the study.

In one of the study \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\narms (group 2, n=329), patients with an inadequate response were allowed to dose titrate with 1.5 mg/kg \nincrements from 3 up to 9 mg/kg. The majority (67%) of these patients did not require any dose titration. Of \nthe patients who required a dose titration, 80% achieved clinical response and the majority (64%) of these \nrequired only one adjustment of 1.5 mg/kg. \n \nAdult Crohn’s disease \nInduction treatment in moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease \nThe efficacy of a single dose treatment with infliximab was assessed in 108 patients with active Crohn’s \ndisease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 ≤ 400) in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-\ncontrolled, dose-response study. Of these 108 patients, 27 were treated with the recommended dosage of \ninfliximab 5 mg/kg. All patients had experienced an inadequate response to prior conventional therapies. \nConcurrent use of stable doses of conventional therapies was permitted, and 92% of patients continued to \nreceive these therapies. \n \nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a clinical response, defined as a \ndecrease in CDAI by ≥ 70 points from baseline at the 4-week evaluation and without an increase in the use \nof medicinal products or surgery for Crohn’s disease. Patients who responded at week 4 were followed to \nweek 12. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 4 \n(CDAI < 150) and clinical response over time. \n \nAt week 4, following administration of a single dose, 22/27 (81%) of infliximab-treated patients receiving a \n5 mg/kg dose achieved a clinical response vs. 4/25 (16%) of the placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). Also at \nweek 4, 13/27 (48%) of infliximab-treated patients achieved a clinical remission (CDAI < 150) vs. 1/25 (4%) \nof placebo-treated patients. A response was observed within 2 weeks, with a maximum response at 4 weeks. \nAt the last observation at 12 weeks, 13/27 (48%) of infliximab-treated patients were still responding. \n \nMaintenance treatment in moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in adults \nThe efficacy of repeated infusions with infliximab was studied in a 1-year clinical study (ACCENT I). \nA total of 573 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CDAI ≥ 220 ≤ 400) received a \nsingle infusion of 5 mg/kg at week 0. 178 of the 580 enrolled patients (30.7%) were defined as having severe \ndisease (CDAI score > 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressants) corresponding to the \npopulation defined in the indication (see section 4.1). At week 2, all patients were assessed for clinical \nresponse and randomised to one of 3 treatment groups; a placebo maintenance group, 5 mg/kg maintenance \ngroup and 10 mg/kg maintenance group. All 3 groups received repeated infusions at week 2, 6 and every \n8 weeks thereafter. \n \nOf the 573 patients randomised, 335 (58%) achieved clinical response by week 2. These patients were \nclassified as week-2 responders and were included in the primary analysis (see Table 5). Among patients \nclassified as non-responders at week 2, 32% (26/81) in the placebo maintenance group and 42% (68/163) in \nthe infliximab group achieved clinical response by week 6. There was no difference between groups in the \nnumber of late responders thereafter. \n \n \nThe co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients in clinical remission (CDAI < 150) at week 30 and \ntime to loss of response through week 54. Corticosteroid tapering was permitted after week 6. \n \n\nTable 5 \nEffects on response and remission rate, data from ACCENT I (week-2 responders) \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\na Reduction in CDAI ≥ 25% and ≥ 70 points.  \nb CDAI < 150 at both week 30 and 54 and not receiving corticosteroids in the 3 months prior to week 54 among patients who were \nreceiving corticosteroids at baseline.  \n \nBeginning at week 14, patients who had responded to treatment, but subsequently lost their clinical benefit, \nwere allowed to cross over to a dose of infliximab 5 mg/kg higher than the dose to which they were \noriginally randomised. Eighty nine percent (50/56) of patients who lost clinical response on infliximab \n5 mg/kg maintenance therapy after week 14 responded to treatment with infliximab 10 mg/kg. \n \nImprovements in quality of life measures, a reduction in disease-related hospitalisations and corticosteroid \nuse were seen in the infliximab maintenance groups compared with the placebo maintenance group at weeks \n30 and 54. \n \nInfliximab with or without AZA was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, active comparator study \n(SONIC) of 508 adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CDAI ≥ 220 ≤ 450) who were naive \nto biologics and immunosuppressants and had a median disease duration of 2.3 years. At baseline 27.4% of \npatients were receiving systemic corticosteroids, 14.2% of patients were receiving budesonide, and 54.3% of \npatients were receiving 5-ASA compounds. Patients were randomised to receive AZA monotherapy, \ninfliximab monotherapy, or infliximab plus AZA combination therapy. Infliximab was administered at a \ndose of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks. AZA was given at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg daily. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26, defined as patients \nin clinical remission (CDAI of < 150) who, for at least 3 weeks, had not taken oral systemic corticosteroids \n(prednisone or equivalent) or budesonide at a dose > 6 mg/day. For results see Table 6. The proportions of \npatients with mucosal healing at week 26 were significantly greater in the infliximab plus AZA combination \n(43.9%, p < 0.001) and infliximab monotherapy groups (30.1%, p=0.023) compared to the AZA \nmonotherapy group (16.5%). \n \n\nTable 6 \nPercent of patients achieving corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26, SONIC \n\n AZA \nMonotherapy \n\nInfliximab \nMonotherapy \n\nInfliximab + AZA \nCombination therapy \n\nWeek 26  \n\nAll randomised patients 30.0% (51/170) 44.4% (75/169) (p=0.006)* \n56.8% (96/169) \n\n(p<0.001)* \n\n ACCENT I (week-2 responders) \n% of Patients \n\nPlacebo Maintenance \n(n=110) \n\nInfliximab \nMaintenance \n\n5 mg/kg \n(n=113) \n(p value) \n\nInfliximab \nMaintenance \n\n10 mg/kg \n(n=112) \n(p value) \n\nMedian time to loss of \nresponse through week 54  19 weeks \n\n38 weeks \n(0.002) \n\n> 54 weeks \n(< 0.001) \n\nWeek 30 \n\nClinical Responsea  27.3 51.3 (< 0.001) \n59.1 \n\n(< 0.001) \n\nClinical Remission  20.9 38.9 (0.003) \n45.5 \n\n(< 0.001) \n\nSteroid-Free Remission  10.7 (6/56) 31.0 (18/58) (0.008) \n36.8 (21/57) \n\n(0.001) \nWeek 54 \n\nClinical Responsea  15.5 38.1 (< 0.001) \n47.7 \n\n(< 0.001) \n\nClinical Remission  13.6 28.3 (0.007) \n38.4 \n\n(< 0.001) \nSustained Steroid-Free \nRemissionb 5.7 (3/53) \n\n17.9 (10/56) \n(0.075) \n\n28.6 (16/56) \n(0.002) \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n* P-values represent each infliximab treatment group vs. AZA monotherapy \n \nSimilar trends in the achievement of corticosteroid-free clinical remission were observed at week 50. \nFurthermore, improved quality of life as measured by IBDQ was observed with infliximab. \n \nInduction treatment in fistulising active Crohn’s disease \nThe efficacy was assessed in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 94 patients with \nfistulising Crohn’s disease who had fistulae that were of at least 3 months’ duration. Thirty one of these \npatients were treated with infliximab 5 mg/kg. Approximately 93% of the patients had previously received \nantibiotic or immunosuppressive therapy. \n \nConcurrent use of stable doses of conventional therapies was permitted, and 83% of patients continued to \nreceive at least one of these therapies. Patients received three doses of either placebo or infliximab at weeks \n0, 2 and 6. Patients were followed up to 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who \nexperienced a clinical response, defined as ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in the number of fistulae draining \nupon gentle compression on at least two consecutive visits (4 weeks apart), without an increase in the use of \nmedicinal products or surgery for Crohn’s disease. \n \nSixty eight percent (21/31) of infliximab-treated patients receiving a 5 mg/kg dose regimen achieved a \nclinical response vs. 26% (8/31) placebo-treated patients (p=0.002). The median time to onset of response in \nthe infliximab-treated group was 2 weeks. The median duration of response was 12 weeks. Additionally, \nclosure of all fistulae was achieved in 55% of infliximab-treated patients compared with 13% of placebo-\ntreated patients (p=0.001). \n \nMaintenance treatment in fistulising active Crohn’s disease \nThe efficacy of repeated infusions with infliximab in patients with fistulising Crohn’s disease was studied in \na 1-year clinical study (ACCENT II). A total of 306 patients received 3 doses of infliximab 5 mg/kg at week \n0, 2 and 6. At baseline, 87% of the patients had perianal fistulae, 14% had abdominal fistulae, 9% had \nrectovaginal fistulae. The median CDAI score was 180. At week 14, 282 patients were assessed for clinical \nresponse and randomised to receive either placebo or 5 mg/kg infliximab every 8 weeks through week 46. \n \nWeek-14 responders (195/282) were analysed for the primary endpoint, which was time from randomisation \nto loss of response (see Table 7).

Among patients in the infliximab 5 mg/kg group who \ncrossed over because of loss of fistula response after week 22, 57% (12/21) responded to re-treatment with \ninfliximab 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nThere was no significant difference between placebo and infliximab for the proportion of patients with \nsustained closure of all fistulas through week 54, for symptoms such as proctalgia, abscesses and urinary \ntract infection or for number of newly developed fistulas during treatment. \n \nMaintenance therapy with infliximab every 8 weeks significantly reduced disease-related hospitalisations \nand surgeries compared with placebo. Furthermore, a reduction in corticosteroid use and improvements in \nquality of life were observed. \n \nAdult ulcerative colitis \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab were assessed in two (ACT 1 and ACT 2) randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis \n(Mayo score 6 to 12; Endoscopy subscore ≥ 2) with an inadequate response to conventional therapies [oral \ncorticosteroids, aminosalicylates and/or immunomodulators (6-MP, AZA)]. Concomitant stable doses of oral \naminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted. In both studies, patients \nwere randomised to receive either placebo, 5 mg/kg infliximab, or 10 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 \nand 22, and in ACT 1 at weeks 30, 38 and 46.

Clinical remission and mucosal healing \noccurred in a greater proportion of patients in the combined infliximab treatment group compared to the \nplacebo treatment group at week 54 (34.6% vs. 16.5%, p < 0.001 and 46.1% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.001, \nrespectively). The proportions of patients in sustained response and sustained remission at week 54 were \ngreater in the combined infliximab treatment group than in the placebo treatment group (37.9% vs. 14.0%, \np < 0.001; and 20.2% vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001, respectively). \n \nA greater proportion of patients in the combined infliximab treatment group were able to discontinue \ncorticosteroids while remaining in clinical remission compared to the placebo treatment group at both week \n30 (22.3% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001, pooled ACT 1 & ACT 2 data) and week 54 (21.0% vs. 8.9%, p=0.022, \nACT 1 data).  \n \nThe pooled data analysis from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 studies and their extensions, analysed from baseline \nthrough 54 weeks, demonstrated a reduction of ulcerative colitis-related hospitalisations and surgical \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nprocedures with infliximab treatment. The number of ulcerative colitis-related hospitalisations was \nsignificantly lower in the 5 and 10 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups than in the placebo group (mean \nnumber of hospitalisations per 100 subject-years: 21 and 19 vs. 40 in the placebo group; p=0.019 and \np=0.007, respectively). The number of ulcerative colitis-related surgical procedures was also lower in the \n5 and 10 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups than in the placebo group (mean number of surgical procedures \nper 100 subject-years: 22 and 19 vs. 34; p=0.145 and p=0.022, respectively). \n \nThe proportion of subjects who underwent colectomy at any time within 54 weeks following the first \ninfusion of study agent were collected and pooled from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 studies and their extensions. \nFewer subjects underwent colectomy in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group (28/242 or 11.6% [N.S.]) and the \n10 mg/kg infliximab group (18/242 or 7.4% [p=0.011]) than in the placebo group (36/244; 14.8%). \n \nThe reduction in incidence of colectomy was also examined in another randomised, double-blind study \n(C0168Y06) in hospitalised patients (n=45) with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who failed \nto respond to intravenous corticosteroids and who were therefore at higher risk for colectomy. Significantly \nfewer colectomies occurred within 3 months of study infusion in patients who received a single dose of 5 \nmg/kg infliximab compared to patients who received placebo (29.2% vs. 66.7% respectively, p=0.017). \n \nIn ACT 1 and ACT 2, infliximab improved quality of life, confirmed by statistically significant improvement \nin both a disease specific measure, IBDQ, and by improvement in the generic 36-item short form survey SF-\n36. \n \nAdult ankylosing spondylitis \nEfficacy and safety of infliximab were assessed in two multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies \nin patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index \n[BASDAI] score ≥ 4 and spinal pain ≥ 4 on a scale of 1-10). \n \nIn the first study (P01522), which had a 3 month double-blind phase, 70 patients received either 5 mg/kg \ninfliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6 (35 patients in each group). At week 12, placebo patients were \nswitched to infliximab 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks up to week 54. After the first year of the study, 53 patients \ncontinued into an open-label extension to week 102. \n \nIn the second clinical study (ASSERT), 279 patients were randomised to receive either placebo (Group 1, \nn=78) or 5 mg/kg infliximab (Group 2, n=201) at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and every 6 weeks to week 24. Thereafter, \nall subjects continued on infliximab every 6 weeks to week 96. Group 1 received 5 mg/kg infliximab. In \nGroup 2, starting with the week 36 infusion, patients who had a BASDAI ≥ 3 at 2 consecutive visits, \nreceived 7.5 mg/kg infliximab every 6 weeks thereafter through week 96. \n \nIn ASSERT, improvement in signs and symptoms was observed as early as week 2. At week 24, the number \nof ASAS 20 responders was 15/78 (19%) in the placebo group, and 123/201 (61%) in the 5 mg/kg infliximab \ngroup (p < 0.001). There were 95 subjects from group 2 who continued on 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks. At \n102 weeks there were 80 subjects still on infliximab treatment and among those, 71 (89%) were ASAS 20 \nresponders. \n \nIn P01522, improvement in signs and symptoms was also observed as early as week 2. At week 12, the \nnumber of BASDAI 50 responders were 3/35 (9%) in the placebo group, and 20/35 (57%) in the 5 mg/kg \ngroup (p < 0.01). There were 53 subjects who continued on 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks. At 102 weeks there were \n49 subjects still on infliximab treatment and among those, 30 (61%) were BASDAI 50 responders. \n \nIn both studies, physical function and quality of life as measured by the BASFI and the physical component \nscore of the SF-36 were also improved significantly. \n \nAdult psoriatic arthritis \nEfficacy and safety were assessed in two multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients \nwith active psoriatic arthritis. \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \nIn the first clinical study (IMPACT), efficacy and safety of infliximab were studied in 104 patients with \nactive polyarticular psoriatic arthritis. During the 16-week double-blind phase, patients received either \n5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14 (52 patients in each group). Starting at week 16, \nplacebo patients were switched to infliximab and all patients subsequently received 5 mg/kg infliximab every \n8 weeks up to week 46. After the first year of the study, 78 patients continued into an open-label extension to \nweek 98. \n \nIn the second clinical study (IMPACT 2), efficacy and safety of infliximab were studied in 200 patients with \nactive psoriatic arthritis (≥ 5 swollen joints and ≥ 5 tender joints). Forty six percent of patients continued on \nstable doses of methotrexate (≤ 25 mg/week). During the 24-week double-blind phase, patients received \neither 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22 (100 patients in each group). At week 16, \n47 placebo patients with < 10% improvement from baseline in both swollen and tender joint counts were \nswitched to infliximab induction (early escape). At week 24, all placebo-treated patients crossed over to \ninfliximab induction. Dosing continued for all patients through week 46. \n \nKey efficacy results for IMPACT and IMPACT 2 are shown in Table 9 below: \n \n\nTable 9 \nEffects on ACR and PASI in IMPACT and IMPACT 2 \n\n \nIMPACT IMPACT 2* \n\nPlacebo \n(week 16) \n\nInfliximab \n(week 16) \n\nInfliximab \n(week 98) \n\nPlacebo \n(week 24) \n\nInfliximab \n(week 24) \n\nInfliximab \n(week 54) \n\nPatients randomised 52 52 N/Aa 100 100 100 \n \nACR response  (% of patients)  \nN  52 52 78 100 100 100 \nACR 20 response*  5(10%) 34 (65%) 48 (62%) 16 (16%) 54 (54%) 53 (53%) \nACR 50 response*  0(0%) 24 (46%) 35 (45%) 4 (4%) 41(41%) 33 (33%) \nACR 70 response*  0(0%) 15 (29%) 27 (35%) 2 (2%) 27 (27%) 20 (20%) \nPASI response (% of patients)b \nN  N/A 87 83 82 PASI 75 response**  1 (1%) 50 (60%) 40 (48.8%) \n* ITT-analysis where subjects with missing data were included as non-responders \na Week 98 data for IMPACT includes combined placebo crossover and infliximab patients who entered the open-label extension \nb Based on patients with PASI ≥ 2.5 at baseline for IMPACT, and patients with ≥ 3% BSA psoriasis skin involvement at baseline in \nIMPACT 2 \n** PASI 75 response for IMPACT not included due to low N; p < 0.001 for infliximab vs. placebo at week 24 for IMPACT 2 \n \nIn IMPACT and IMPACT 2, clinical responses were observed as early as week 2 and were maintained \nthrough week 98 and week 54 respectively. Efficacy has been demonstrated with or without concomitant use \nof methotrexate. Decreases in parameters of peripheral activity characteristic of psoriatic arthritis (such as \nnumber of swollen joints, number of painful/tender joints, dactylitis and presence of enthesopathy) were seen \nin the infliximab-treated patients.  \n \nRadiographic changes were assessed in IMPACT 2. Radiographs of hands and feet were collected at baseline, \nweeks 24 and 54. Infliximab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared \nwith placebo treatment at the week 24 primary endpoint as measured by change from baseline in total \nmodified vdH-S score (mean ± SD score was 0.82 ± 2.62 in the placebo group compared with -0.70 ± 2.53 in \nthe infliximab group; p < 0.001). In the infliximab group, the mean change in total modified vdH-S score \nremained below 0 at the week 54 timepoint. \n \nInfliximab-treated patients demonstrated significant improvement in physical function as assessed by HAQ. \nSignificant improvements in health-related quality of life were also demonstrated as measured by the \nphysical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 in IMPACT 2. \n \nAdult psoriasis \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nThe efficacy of infliximab was assessed in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind studies: SPIRIT and \nEXPRESS. Patients in both studies had plaque psoriasis (Body Surface Area [BSA] ≥ 10% and Psoriasis \nArea and Severity Index [PASI] score ≥ 12). The primary endpoint in both studies was the percent of patients \nwho achieved ≥ 75% improvement in PASI from baseline at week 10. \n \nSPIRIT evaluated the efficacy of infliximab induction therapy in 249 patients with plaque psoriasis that had \npreviously received PUVA or systemic therapy. Patients received either 3 or 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo \ninfusions at weeks 0, 2 and 6. Patients with a PGA score ≥ 3 were eligible to receive an additional infusion of \nthe same treatment at week 26. \nIn SPIRIT, the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 at week 10 was 71.7% in the 3 mg/kg infliximab \ngroup, 87.9% in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group, and 5.9% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). By week 26, \ntwenty weeks after the last induction dose, 30% of patients in the 5 mg/kg group and 13.8% of patients in the \n3 mg/kg group were PASI 75 responders. Between weeks 6 and 26, symptoms of psoriasis gradually \nreturned with a median time to disease relapse of > 20 weeks. No rebound was observed. \n \nEXPRESS evaluated the efficacy of infliximab induction and maintenance therapy in 378 patients with \nplaque psoriasis. Patients received 5 mg/kg infliximab- or placebo-infusions at weeks 0, 2 and 6 followed by \nmaintenance therapy every 8 weeks through week 22 in the placebo group and through week 46 in the \ninfliximab group. At week 24, the placebo group crossed over to infliximab induction therapy (5 mg/kg) \nfollowed by infliximab maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg). Nail psoriasis was assessed using the Nail Psoriasis \nSeverity Index (NAPSI). Prior therapy with PUVA, methotrexate, ciclosporin, or acitretin had been received \nby 71.4% of patients, although they were not necessarily therapy resistant. Key results are presented in Table \n10. In infliximab treated subjects, significant PASI 50 responses were apparent at the first visit (week 2) and \nPASI 75 responses by the second visit (week 6). Efficacy was similar in the subgroup of patients that were \nexposed to previous systemic therapies compared to the overall study population. \n \n\nTable 10 \nSummary of PASI response, PGA response and percent of patients with all nails cleared at weeks 10, \n\n24 and 50.

Mean baseline NAPSI scores were 4.6 and 4.3 in \ninfliximab and placebo group. \nSignificant improvements from baseline were demonstrated in DLQI (p < 0.001) and the physical and mental component scores of \nthe SF 36 (p < 0.001 for each component comparison). \n \nPaediatric population \nPaediatric Crohn’s disease (6 to 17 years) \nIn the REACH study, 112 patients (6 to 17 years, median age 13.0 years) with moderate to severe, active \nCrohn’s disease (median paediatric CDAI of 40) and an inadequate response to conventional therapies were \nto receive 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. All patients were required to be on a stable dose of 6-MP, \nAZA or MTX (35% were also receiving corticosteroids at baseline). Patients assessed by the investigator to \nbe in clinical response at week 10 were randomised and received 5 mg/kg infliximab at either q8 weeks or \nq12 weeks as a maintenance treatment regimen. If response was lost during maintenance treatment, crossing \nover to a higher dose (10 mg/kg) and/or shorter dosing interval (q8 weeks) was allowed. Thirty two (32) \nevaluable paediatric patients crossed over (9 subjects in the q8 weeks and 23 subjects in the q12 weeks \nmaintenance groups). Twenty four of these patients (75.0%) regained clinical response after crossing over. \nThe proportion of subjects in clinical response at week 10 was 88.4% (99/112). The proportion of subjects \nachieving clinical remission at week 10 was 58.9% (66/112). \nAt week 30, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission was higher in the q8 week (59.6%, 31/52) than \nthe q12 week maintenance treatment group (35.3%, 18/51; p=0.013). At week 54, the figures were 55.8% \n(29/52) and 23.5% (12/51) in the q8 weeks and q12 weeks maintenance groups, respectively (p < 0.001). \nData about fistulas were derived from PCDAI scores. Of the 22 subjects that had fistulas at baseline, 63.6% \n(14/22), 59.1% (13/22) and 68.2% (15/22) were in complete fistula response at week 10, 30 and 54, \nrespectively, in the combined q8 weeks and q12 weeks maintenance groups. \n \nIn addition, statistically and clinically significant improvements in quality of life and height, as well as a \nsignificant reduction in corticosteroid use, were observed versus baseline. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis (6 to 17 years) \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group \nclinical study (C0168T72) in 60 paediatric patients aged 6 through 17 years (median age 14.5 years) with \nmoderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score of 6 to 12; endoscopic subscore ≥ 2) with an \ninadequate response to conventional therapies. At baseline 53% of patients were receiving immunomodulator \ntherapy (6-MP, AZA and/or MTX) and 62% of patients were receiving corticosteroids. Discontinuation of \nimmunomodulators and corticosteroid taper were permitted after week 0. \n \nAll patients received an induction regimen of 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Patients who did not \nrespond to infliximab at week 8 (n=15) received no further medicinal product and returned for safety follow-\nup. At week 8, 45 patients were randomised and received 5 mg/kg infliximab at either q8 weeks or q12 \nweeks as a maintenance treatment regimen. \n \nThe proportion of patients in clinical response at week 8 was 73.3% (44/60). Clinical response at week 8 was \nsimilar between those with or without concomitant immunomodulator use at baseline. Clinical remission at \nweek 8 was 33.3% (17/51) as measured by the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score. \n \nAt week 54, the proportion of patients in clinical remission as measured by the PUCAI score was 38% (8/21) \nin the q8 week maintenance group and 18% (4/22) in the q12 week maintenance treatment group. For \npatients receiving corticosteroids at baseline, the proportion of patients in remission and not receiving \ncorticosteroids at week 54 was 38.5% (5/13) for the q8 week and 0% (0/13) for the q12 week maintenance \ntreatment group. \n \nIn this study, there were more patients in the 12 to 17 year age group than in the 6 to 11 year age group \n(45/60 vs.15/60). While the numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to draw definitive \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nconclusions about the effect of age, there was a higher number of patients in the younger age group who \nstepped up in dose or discontinued treatment due to inadequate efficacy. \n \nOther paediatric indications \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing infliximab in all subsets of the paediatric population in rheumatoid \narthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSingle intravenous infusions of 1, 3, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg of infliximab yielded dose proportional increases in \nthe maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). The volume \nof distribution at steady state (median Vd of 3.0 to 4.1 litres) was not dependent on the administered dose and \nindicated that infliximab is predominantly distributed within the vascular compartment. No time-dependency \nof the Pharmacokinetics was observed. The elimination pathways for infliximab have not been characterised. \nUnchanged infliximab was not detected in urine. No major age- or weight-related differences in clearance or \nvolume of distribution were observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The pharmacokinetics of infliximab in \nelderly patients has not been studied. Studies have not been performed in patients with liver or renal disease. \n \nAt single doses of 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg, the median Cmax values were 77, 118 and 277 micrograms/mL, \nrespectively. The median terminal half-life at these doses ranged from 8 to 9.5 days. In most patients, \ninfliximab could be detected in the serum for at least 8 weeks after the recommended single dose of 5 mg/kg \nfor Crohn’s disease and the rheumatoid arthritis maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks. \n \nRepeated administration of infliximab (5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks in fistulising Crohn’s disease, 3 or \n10 mg/kg every 4 or 8 weeks in rheumatoid arthritis) resulted in a slight accumulation of infliximab in serum \nafter the second dose. No further clinically relevant accumulation was observed. In most fistulising Crohn’s \ndisease patients, infliximab was detected in serum for 12 weeks (range 4-28 weeks) after administration of \nthe regimen. \n \nPaediatric population \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis based on data obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis (N=60), \nCrohn’s disease (N=112), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (N=117) and Kawasaki disease (N=16) with an \noverall age range from 2 months to 17 years indicated that exposure to infliximab was dependent on body \nweight in a non-linear way. Following administration of 5 mg/kg infliximab every 8 weeks, the predicted \nmedian steady-state infliximab exposure (area under concentration-time curve at steady state, AUCss) in \npaediatric patients aged 6 years to 17 years was approximately 20% lower than the predicted median steady-\nstate drug exposure in adults. The median AUCss in paediatric patients aged 2 years to less than 6 years was \npredicted to be approximately 40% lower than that in adults, although the number of patients supporting this \nestimate is limited. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nInfliximab does not cross react with TNFα from species other than human and chimpanzees. Therefore, \nconventional preclinical safety data with infliximab are limited. In a developmental toxicity study conducted \nin mice using an analogous antibody that selectively inhibits the functional activity of mouse TNFα, there \nwas no indication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. In a fertility and general \nreproductive function study, the number of pregnant mice was reduced following administration of the same \nanalogous antibody. It is not known whether this finding was due to effects on the males and/or the females. \nIn a 6-month repeated dose toxicity study in mice, using the same analogous antibody against mouse TNFα, \ncrystalline deposits were observed on the lens capsule of some of the treated male mice. No specific \nophthalmologic examinations have been performed in patients to investigate the relevance of this finding for \nhumans. \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nLong-term studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of infliximab. Studies in \nmice deficient in TNFα demonstrated no increase in tumours when challenged with known tumour initiators \nand/or promoters. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nSucrose \nPolysorbate 80 \nMonobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate \nDibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nBefore reconstitution \n4 years at 2°C – 8°C. \n \nFlixabi may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 25°C for a single period of up to 6 months, but \nnot exceeding the original expiry date. The new expiry date must be written on the carton. Upon removal \nfrom refrigerated storage, Flixabi must not be returned to refrigerated storage. \n  \nAfter reconstitution and dilution: \nChemical and physical in use stability of the diluted solution has been demonstrated for up to 34 days at 2°C \nto 8°C and for an additional 24 hours at 25°C after removal from refrigeration. From a microbiological point \nof view, the infusion solution should be administered immediately, in use storage times and conditions prior \nto use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless \nreconstitution/dilution has been taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). \n \nFor storage conditions up to 25°C before reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nType 1 glass vial with a rubber stopper and aluminium crimp protected by a plastic cap. \n \nFlixabi is available in packs containing 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 vial(s). Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n1. Calculate the dose and the number of Flixabi vials needed. Each Flixabi vial contains 100 mg infliximab. \n\nCalculate the total volume of reconstituted Flixabi solution required. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n2. Under aseptic conditions, reconstitute each Flixabi vial with 10 ml of water for injections, using a \nsyringe equipped with a 21-gauge (0.8 mm) or smaller needle. Remove flip-top from the vial and wipe \nthe top with a 70% alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial through the centre of the rubber \nstopper and direct the stream of water for injections to the glass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the \nsolution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilised powder. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. \nDO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted \nsolution to stand for 5 minutes. Check that the solution is colourless to light yellow and opalescent. The \nsolution may develop a few fine translucent particles, as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if opaque \nparticles, discolouration, or other foreign particles are present. \n\n \n3. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted Flixabi solution dose to 250 ml with sodium chloride 9 \n\nmg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. Do not dilute the reconstituted Flixabi solution with any other \ndiluent. The dilution can be accomplished by withdrawing a volume of the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for infusion from the 250-ml glass bottle or infusion bag equal to the volume of \nreconstituted Flixabi. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted Flixabi solution to the 250-ml \ninfusion bottle or bag. Gently mix. For volumes greater than 250 ml, either use a larger infusion bag (e.g. \n500 ml, 1000 ml) or use multiple 250 ml infusion bags to ensure that the concentration of the infusion \nsolution does not exceed 4 mg/ml. If stored refrigerated after reconstitution and dilution, the infusion \nsolution must be allowed to equilibrate at room temperature to 25 °C for 3 hours prior to Step 4 \n(infusion). Storage beyond 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C applies to preparation of Flixabi in the infusion bag \nonly. \n\n \n4. Administer the infusion solution over a period of not less than the infusion time recommended (see \n\nsection 4.2). Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter \n(pore size 1.2 micrometre or less). Since no preservative is present, it is recommended that the \nadministration of the solution for infusion is to be started as soon as possible and within 3 hours of \nreconstitution and dilution. If not used immediately, in use storage times and conditions prior to use are \nthe responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless \nreconstitution/dilution has been taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions (see section \n6.3 above). Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. \n \n\n5. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-administration of \nFlixabi with other agents. Do not infuse Flixabi concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other \nagents. \n \n\n6. Visually inspect Flixabi for particulate matter or discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if \nvisibly opaque particles, discolouration or foreign particles are observed. \n \n\n7. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \n \n7.

What Flixabi is and what it is used for \n \nFlixabi contains the active substance infliximab. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody – a type of protein that \nattaches to a specific target in the body called TNF (tumour necrosis factor) alpha. \n \nFlixabi belongs to a group of medicines called ‘TNF blockers’. It is used in adults for the following \ninflammatory diseases: \n• Rheumatoid arthritis \n• Psoriatic arthritis \n• Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew’s disease) \n• Psoriasis. \n\n \nFlixabi is also used in adults and children 6 years of age or older for: \n• Crohn’s disease \n• Ulcerative colitis. \n\n \nFlixabi works by selectively attaching to TNF alpha and blocking its action. TNF alpha is involved in \ninflammatory processes of the body so blocking it can reduce the inflammation in your body. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. If you have active rheumatoid arthritis you will \nfirst be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Flixabi which \nyou will take in combination with another medicine called methotrexate to: \n• Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n• Slow down the damage in your joints, \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\n• Improve your physical function. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you have \nactive psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, \nyou will be given Flixabi to: \n• Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n• Slow down the damage in your joints, \n• Improve your physical function. \n\n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (Bechterew’s disease) \nAnkylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine. If you have ankylosing spondylitis you will \nfirst be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Flixabi to: \n• Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease, \n• Improve your physical function. \n\n \nPsoriasis \nPsoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, you will \nfirst be given other medicines or treatments, such as phototherapy. If these medicines or treatments do not \nwork well enough, you will be given Flixabi to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \ngiven other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Flixabi to treat your \ndisease. \n \nCrohn’s disease \nCrohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have Crohn’s disease you will first be given \nother medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Flixabi to: \n• Treat active Crohn’s disease, \n• Reduce the number of abnormal openings (fistulae) between your bowel and your skin that have not \n\nbeen controlled by other medicines or surgery. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Flixabi \n \nYou should not be given Flixabi if \n• You are allergic to infliximab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n• You are allergic (hypersensitive) to proteins that come from mice. \n• You have tuberculosis (TB) or another serious infection such as pneumonia or sepsis. \n• You have heart failure that is moderate or severe. \n\n \nDo not use Flixabi if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before you are \ngiven Flixabi. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before or during treatment with Flixabi if you have: \n \n\nHad treatment with any medicine containing infliximab before \n• Tell your doctor if you have had treatment with medicines containing infliximab in the past and are \n\nnow starting Flixabi treatment again. \n• If you have had a break in your treatment with infliximab of more than 16 weeks, there is a higher \n\nrisk for allergic reactions when you start the treatment again. \n \nInfections \n• Tell your doctor before you are given Flixabi if you have an infection even if it is a very minor one. \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n• Tell your doctor before you are given Flixabi if you have ever lived in or travelled to an area where \ninfections called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are common. These \ninfections are caused by specific types of fungi that can affect the lungs or other parts of your body. \n\n• You may get infections more easily when you are being treated with Flixabi. If you are 65 or older, \nyou have a greater risk. \n\n• These infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, \nbacteria, or other organisms in the environment and sepsis that may be life-threatening. \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get signs of infection during treatment with Flixabi. Signs include \nfever, cough, flu-like signs, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, wounds or dental problems. Your doctor \nmay recommend temporarily stopping Flixabi. \n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n• It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had TB or if you have been in close \n\ncontact with someone who has had or has TB. \n• Your doctor will test you to see if you have TB. Cases of TB have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith Flixabi, even in patients who have already been treated with medicines for TB. Your doctor \nwill record these tests on your patient reminder card. \n\n• If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated with medicines for TB before \nyou are given Flixabi. \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get signs of TB during treatment with Flixabi. Signs include \npersistent cough, weight loss, feeling tired, fever, night sweats. \n \nHepatitis B virus  \n• Tell your doctor before you are given Flixabi if you are a carrier of hepatitis B or have ever had it. \n• Tell your doctor if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis B. \n• Your doctor should test you for hepatitis B virus. \n• Treatment with TNF blockers such as Flixabi may result in reactivation of hepatitis B virus in \n\npatients who carry this virus, which can be life-threatening in some cases. \n \nHeart problems \n• Tell your doctor if you have any heart problems, such as mild heart failure. \n• Your doctor will want to closely monitor your heart. \nTell your doctor straight away if you get new or worsening signs of heart failure during treatment with \nFlixabi. Signs include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet. \n \nCancer and lymphoma \n• Tell your doctor before you are given Flixabi if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of \n\nblood cancer) or any other cancer. \n• Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at \n\nhigher risk of developing lymphoma. \n• Children and adults taking Flixabi may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another \n\ncancer. \n• Some patients who have received TNF-blockers, including Flixabi have developed a rare type of \n\ncancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Of these patients, most were teenage boys or young \nmen and most had either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. This type of cancer has usually \nresulted in death. Almost all patients had also received medicines containing azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine in addition to TNF-blockers. \n\n• Some patients treated with infliximab have developed certain kinds of skin cancer. If there are any \nchanges in your skin or growths on the skin during or after therapy, tell your doctor. \n\n• Some women being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with infliximab have developed cervical cancer. \nFor women taking infliximab including those over 60 years of age, your doctor may recommend \nregular screening for cervical cancer. \n\n \nLung disease or heavy smoking \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n• Tell your doctor before you are given Flixabi if you have a lung disease called Chronic Obstructive \nPulmonary Disease (COPD) or if you are a heavy smoker. \n\n• Patients with COPD and patients who are heavy smokers may have a higher risk of developing \ncancer with Flixabi treatment. \n\n \nNervous system disease \n• Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a problem that affects your nervous system before \n\nyou are given Flixabi. This includes multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, if you have fits or \nhave been diagnosed with ‘optic neuritis’. \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of a nerve disease during treatment with Flixabi. \nSigns include changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs, numbness or tingling in any part of \nyour body. \n \nAbnormal skin openings \n• Tell your doctor if you have any abnormal skin openings (fistulae) before you are given Flixabi. \n \nVaccinations \n• Talk to your doctor if you recently have had or are due to have a vaccine. \n• You should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Flixabi treatment. You may receive \n\nsome vaccines during treatment with Flixabi but you should not receive live vaccines (vaccines that \ncontain a living but weakened infectious agent) while using Flixabi because they may cause \ninfections. \n\n• If you received Flixabi while you were pregnant, your baby may also be at higher risk for getting \nan infection with live vaccines for up to six months after birth. It is important that you tell your \nbaby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Flixabi use so they can decide when \nyour baby should receive any vaccine, including live vaccines such as BCG (used to prevent \ntuberculosis). For more information see section on Pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n\n \nTherapeutic infectious agents \n• Talk to your doctor if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment with a \n\ntherapeutic infectious agent (such as BCG instillation used for the treatment of cancer). \n \nOperations or dental procedures \n• Tell your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures. \n• Tell your surgeon or dentist that you are having treatment with Flixabi by showing them your \n\npatient reminder card. \n \n\nLiver problems \n• Some patients receiving infliximab have developed serious liver problems. \nTell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of liver problems during treatment with Flixabi. \nSigns include yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark-brown coloured urine, pain or swelling in the upper \nright side of the stomach area, joint pain, skin rashes, or fever. \n\n \nLow blood counts \n• In some patients receiving infliximab, the body may not make enough of the blood cells that help \nfight infections or help stop bleeding. \nTell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of low blood counts during treatment with Flixabi. \nSigns include persistent fever, bleeding or bruising more easily, small red or purple spots caused by \nbleeding under the skin, or looking pale. \n\n \nImmune system disorder \n• Some patients receiving infliximab have developed symptoms of an immune system disorder called \nlupus. \nTell your doctor straight away if you develop symptoms of lupus during treatment with Flixabi. Signs \ninclude joint pain or a rash on cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun. \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nThe information above also applies to children and adolescents. In addition: \n• Some children and teenage patients who have received TNF-blockers such as Flixabi have \n\ndeveloped cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death. \n• More children taking Flixabi developed infections as compared to adults. \n• Children should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Flixabi treatment.  \n\nChildren may receive some vaccines during treatment with Flixabi but should not receive live \nvaccines while using Flixabi. \n\n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor before you are given Flixabi. \n \nOther medicines and Flixabi \nPatients who have inflammatory diseases already take medicines to treat their problem. These medicines may \ncause side effects. Your doctor will advise you what other medicines you must keep using while you are \nhaving Flixabi. \n \nTell your doctor if you are using or have recently used any other medicines, including any other medicines to \ntreat Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or \npsoriasis or medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins and herbal medicines. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are using any of the following medicines: \n• Medicines that affect your immune system. \n• Kineret (anakinra). Flixabi and Kineret should not be used together. \n• Orencia (abatacept). Flixabi and Orencia should not be used together. \n\n \nWhile using Flixabi you should not receive live vaccines. If you were using Flixabi during pregnancy, tell \nyour baby’s doctor and other healthcare professionals caring for your baby about your Flixabi use before the \nbaby receives any vaccines. \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Flixabi. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding, and fertility \n• If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Flixabi should only be used during pregnancy if \nyour doctor feels it is necessary for you. \n\n• You should avoid getting pregnant when you are being treated with Flixabi and for 6 months after you \nstop being treated with it. Discuss the use of contraception during this time with your doctor. \n\n• Do not breast-feed when you are being treated with Flixabi or for 6 months after your last treatment \nwith Flixabi. \n\n• If you received Flixabi during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \ninfection.  \n\n• It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about your Flixabi \nuse before your baby is given any vaccine. If you received Flixabi while pregnant, giving BCG vaccine \n(used to prevent tuberculosis) to your baby within 6 months after birth may result in infection with \nserious complications, including death. Live vaccines such as BCG should not be given to your baby \nwithin 6 months after birth. For more information see section on vaccination. \n\n• Severely decreased numbers of white blood cells have been reported in infants born to women treated \nwith Flixabi during pregnancy. If your baby has continual fevers or infections, contact your baby’s \ndoctor immediately. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nFlixabi is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel tired, dizzy, or unwell \nafter having Flixabi, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n \nFlixabi contains sodium \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.However, before Flixabi is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that contains sodium. Talk to your \ndoctor if you are on a low salt diet. \n \n3. How Flixabi will be given \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \nThe usual dose is 3 mg for every kg of body weight. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew’s disease), psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and \nCrohn's disease \nThe usual dose is 5 mg for every kg of body weight. \n \nHow Flixabi is given \n• Flixabi will be given to you by your doctor or nurse. \n• Your doctor or nurse will prepare the medicine for infusion. \n• The medicine will be given as an infusion (drip) (over 2 hours) into one of your veins, usually in your \n\narm. After the third treatment, your doctor may decide to give your dose of Flixabi over 1 hour. \n• You will be monitored while you are given Flixabi and also for 1 to 2 hours afterwards. \n\n \nHow much Flixabi is given \n• The doctor will decide your dose  and how often you will be given Flixabi. This will depend on your \n\ndisease, weight and how well you respond to Flixabi. \n• The table below shows how often you will usually have this medicine after your first dose. \n\n \n2nd dose  2 weeks after your 1stdose \n3rd dose 6 weeks after your 1stdose \nFurther doses  Every 6 to 8 weeks depending on your disease  \n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \nFlixabi should only be used in children and adolescents if they are being treated for Crohn`s disease or \nulcerative colitis. These children must be 6 years of age or older. \n \nIf you are given too much Flixabi \nAs this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. There \nare no known side effects of having too much of Flixabi. \n \nIf you forget or miss your Flixabi infusion \nIf you forget or miss an appointment to receive Flixabi, make another appointment as soon as possible. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side effects \nare mild to moderate. However some patients may experience serious side effects and may require treatment. \nSide effects may also occur after your treatment with Flixabi has stopped. \n \nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following: \n• Signs of an allergic reaction such as swelling of your face, lips, mouth or throat which may cause \n\ndifficulty in swallowing or breathing, skin rash, hives, swelling of the hands, feet or ankles.

The side effects that happened more in \nchildren were: low red blood cells (anaemia), blood in stool, low overall levels of white blood cells \n(leucopenia), redness or blushing (flushing), viral infections, low levels of white blood cells that fight \ninfection (neutropenia), bone fracture, bacterial infection and allergic reactions of the breathing tract. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

The new expiry date must be written on the carton. Upon removal \nfrom refrigerated storage, Flixabi must not be returned to refrigerated storage. \n \nInstructions for use and handling – reconstitution, dilution and administration  \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of the \nadministered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. \n \n1. Calculate the dose and the number of Flixabi vials needed. Each Flixabi vial contains 100 mg infliximab. \n\nCalculate the total volume of reconstituted Flixabi solution required. \n \n2. Under aseptic conditions, reconstitute each Flixabi vial with 10 ml of water for injections, using a \n\nsyringe equipped with a 21-gauge (0.8 mm) or smaller needle. Remove flip-top from the vial and wipe \nthe top with a 70% alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial through the centre of the rubber \nstopper and direct the stream of water for injections to the glass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the \nsolution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilised powder. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. \nDO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted \nsolution to stand for 5 minutes. Check that the solution is colourless to light yellow and opalescent. The \nsolution may develop a few fine translucent particles, as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if opaque \nparticles, discolouration, or other foreign particles are present. \n\n \n3. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted Flixabi solution dose to 250 ml with sodium chloride 9 \n\nmg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. Do not dilute the reconstituted Flixabi solution with any other \ndiluent. The dilution can be accomplished by withdrawing a volume of the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for infusion from the 250-ml glass bottle or infusion bag equal to the volume of \nreconstituted Flixabi. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted Flixabi solution to the 250-ml \ninfusion bottle or bag. Gently mix. For volumes greater than 250 ml, either use a larger infusion bag (e.g. \n500 ml, 1000 ml) or use multiple 250 ml infusion bags to ensure that the concentration of the infusion \nsolution does not exceed 4 mg/ml. If stored refrigerated after reconstitution and dilution, the infusion \nsolution must be allowed to equilibrate at room temperature to 25 °C for 3 hours prior to Step 4 \n(infusion). Storage beyond 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C applies to preparation of Flixabi in the infusion bag \nonly. \n\n \n4. Administer the infusion solution over a period of not less than the infusion time recommended. Use only \n\nan infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 1.2 \nmicrometre or less). Since no preservative is present, it is recommended that the administration of the \nsolution for infusion is to be started as soon as possible and within 3 hours of reconstitution and dilution. \nIf not used immediately, in use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \nand would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless reconstitution/dilution has been \ntaken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. Do not store any unused portion of the \ninfusion solution for reuse. \n\n \n5. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-administration of \n\nFlixabi with other agents. Do not infuse Flixabi concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other \nagents. \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n \n6. Visually inspect Flixabi for particulate matter or discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if \n\nvisibly opaque particles, discolouration or foreign particles are observed. \n \n\n7. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
