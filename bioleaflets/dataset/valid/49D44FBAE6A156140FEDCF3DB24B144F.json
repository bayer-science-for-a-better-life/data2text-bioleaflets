PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\n \n\nYellow, capsule shaped film-coated tablet, approximately 19.1 mm x 10.2 mm, debossed with \u2018M163\u2019 \n\non one side and plain on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nRitonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 \n\ninfected patients (adults and children of 2 years of age and older). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nRitonavir Mylan should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n\nWhen ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other protease inhibitors the Summary of \n\nProduct Characteristics for the particular protease inhibitor must be consulted. \n\n \n\nThe following HIV-1 protease inhibitors have been approved for use with ritonavir as a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses. \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nAmprenavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. \n\nAtazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily. \n\nFosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. \n\nLopinavir co-formulated with ritonavir (lopinavir/ritonavir) 400 mg/100 mg or 800 mg/200 mg. \n\nSaquinavir 1,000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ART experienced patients. \n\nInitiate treatment with saquinavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily for the first \n\n7 days, then saquinavir 1,000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ART-na\u00efve patients. \n\nTipranavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. Tipranavir with ritonavir should not \n\nbe used in treatment-na\u00efve patients. \n\nDarunavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in antiretroviral treatment. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n(ART) experienced patients. Darunavir 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily may be \n\nused in some ART experienced patients. Refer to the darunavir Summary of Product Characteristics \n\nfor further information on once daily dosing in ART experienced patients. \n\nDarunavir 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily in ART-na\u00efve patients. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nRitonavir is recommended for children 2 years of age and older. For further dosage recommendations, \n\nrefer to the product information of other Protease Inhibitors approved for co-administration with \n\nritonavir. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nAs ritonavir is primarily metabolised by the liver, ritonavir may be appropriate for use with caution as \n\na pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with renal insufficiency depending on the specific protease \n\ninhibitor with which it is co-administered. However, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is \n\nnegligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment. \n\nFor specific dosing information in patients with renal impairment, refer to the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics (SPC) of the co-administered protease inhibitor. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRitonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer to patients with decompensated liver \n\ndisease, (see section 4.3). In the absence of pharmacokinetic studies in patients with stable severe \n\nhepatic impairment (Child Pugh Grade C) without decompensation, caution should be exercised when \n\nritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer as increased levels of the co-administered PI may \n\noccur. Specific recommendations for use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with \n\nhepatic impairment are dependent on the protease inhibitor with which it is co-administered. The SPC \n\nof the co-administered PI should be reviewed for specific dosing information in this patient \n\npopulation. \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose of ritonavir is 600 mg (6 tablets) twice daily (total of 1,200 mg per day) by \n\nmouth. \n\n \n\nGradually increasing the dose of ritonavir when initiating therapy may help to improve tolerance. \n\nTreatment should be initiated at 300 mg (3 tablets) twice daily for a period of three days and increased \n\nby 100 mg (1 tablet) twice daily increments up to 600 mg twice daily over a period of no longer than \n\n14 days. Patients should not remain on 300 mg twice daily for more than 3 days. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (2 years of age and above) \n\nThe recommended dosage of ritonavir in children is 350 mg/m2 by mouth twice daily and should not \n\nexceed 600 mg twice daily. Ritonavir should be started at 250 mg/m2 and increased at 2 to 3 day \n\nintervals by 50 mg/m2 twice daily.  \n\n \n\nOther pharmaceutical forms/strengths may be more appropriate for administration to this population. \n\n \n\nFor older children it may be feasible to substitute tablets for the maintenance dose of other \n\npharmaceutical forms. \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nDosage conversion from oral solution to tablets for children \n\n \n\nOral solution dose Tablet dose \n\n175 mg (2.2 ml) twice daily 200 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening \n\n350 mg (4.4 ml) twice daily 400 mg in the morning and 300 mg in the evening \n\n437.5 mg (5.5 ml) twice daily 500 mg in the morning and 400 mg in the evening \n\n525 mg (6.6 ml) twice daily 500 mg in the morning and 500 mg in the evening \n\n \n\nRitonavir is not recommended in children below 2 years of age due to lack of data on safety and \n\nefficacy. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nPharmacokinetic data indicated that no dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section \n\n5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nCurrently, there are no data specific to this patient population and therefore specific dosage \n\nrecommendations cannot be made. The renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible therefore; a decrease \n\nin the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment. Because ritonavir is \n\nhighly protein bound it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal \n\ndialysis. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRitonavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that no \n\ndose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\nRitonavir must not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ritonavir in children aged below 2 years has not been established. Currently \n\navailable data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \n\nmade. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nRitonavir Mylan film-coated tablets are administered orally and should be ingested with food (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nRitonavir Mylan film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nWhen ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of other PIs, consult the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor for contraindications. \n\n \n\nRitonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent to patients \n\nwith decompensated liver disease. \n\n \n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A- and \n\nCYP2D6- mediated biotransformations. The following medicines are contraindicated when used with \n\nritonavir and unless otherwise noted, the contraindication is based on the potential for ritonavir to \n\ninhibit metabolism of the co-administered medicinal product, resulting in increased exposure to the \n\nco-administered medicinal product and risk of clinically significant adverse effects. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe enzyme-modulating effect of ritonavir may be dose dependent. For some products, \n\ncontraindications may be more relevant when ritonavir is used as an antiretroviral agent than when \n\nritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. rifabutin and voriconazole): \n\n \n\nMedicinal Product Class Medicinal Products within \n\nClass \n\nRationale \n\nConcomitant medicinal product levels increased or decreased \n\n\u03b11-Adrenoreceptor \n\nAntagonist \n\nAlfuzosin Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of alfuzosin \n\nwhich may lead to severe \n\nhypotension (see section 4.5). \n\nAnalgesics Pethidine, piroxicam, \n\npropoxyphene \n\nIncreased plasma \n\nconcentrations of norpethidine, \n\npiroxicam and propoxyphene. \n\nThereby, increasing the risk of \n\nserious respiratory depression \n\nor haematologic abnormalities, \n\nor other serious adverse effects \n\nfrom these agents. \n\nAntianginal Ranolazine Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of ranolazine \n\nwhich may increase the \n\npotential for serious and/or \n\nlife-threatening reactions (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\nAnticancer Neratinib Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of neratinib \n\nwhich may increase the \n\npotential for serious and/or \n\nlife-threatening reactions \n\nincluding hepatotoxicity (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\nVenetoclax Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of venetoclax. \n\nIncreased risk of tumor lysis \n\nsyndrome at the dose initiation \n\nand during the dose-titration \n\nphase (see section 4.5). \n\nAntiarrhythmics Amiodarone, bepridil, \n\ndronedarone, encainide, \n\nflecainide, propafenone, \n\nquinidine \n\nIncreased plasma \n\nconcentrations of amiodarone, \n\nbepridil, dronedarone, \n\nencainide, flecainide, \n\npropafenone, quinidine. \n\nThereby, increasing the risk of \n\narrhythmias or other serious \n\nadverse effects from these \n\nagents. \n\nAntibiotic Fusidic acid Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of fusidic acid \n\nand ritonavir. \n\nAntifungal Voriconazole Concomitant use of ritonavir \n\n(400 mg twice daily and more) \n\nand voriconazole is \n\ncontraindicated due to a \n\nreduction in voriconazole \n\nplasma concentrations and \n\n\n\n6 \n\npossible loss of effect (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\nAntihistamines Astemizole, terfenadine Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of astemizole \n\nand terfenadine. Thereby, \n\nincreasing the risk of serious \n\narrhythmias from these agents. \n\nAnti-gout Colchicine Potential for serious and/or \n\nlife-threatening reactions in \n\npatients with renal and/or \n\nhepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nAntimycobacterial Rifabutin Concomitant use of ritonavir \n\n(500 mg twice daily) dosed as \n\nan antiretroviral agent and \n\nrifabutin due to an increase of \n\nrifabutin serum concentrations \n\nand risk of adverse reactions \n\nincluding uveitis (see section \n\n4.4). \n\nRecommendations regarding \n\nuse of ritonavir dosed as a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer with \n\nrifabutin are noted in section \n\n4.5. \n\nAntipsychotics/ \n\nNeuroleptics \n\nLurasidone Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of lurasidone \n\nwhich may increase the \n\npotential for serious and/or \n\nlife-threatening reactions (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n Clozapine, pimozide Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of clozapine \n\nand pimozide. Thereby, \n\nincreasing the risk of serious \n\nhaematologic abnormalities, or \n\nother serious adverse effects \n\nfrom these agents. \n\n Quetiapine Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of quetiapine \n\nwhich may lead to coma. The \n\nconcomitant administration \n\nwith quetiapine is \n\ncontraindicated (see section \n\n4.5). \n\nErgot derivatives Dihydroergotamine, \n\nergonovine, ergotamine, \n\nmethylergonovine \n\nIncreased plasma \n\nconcentrations of ergot \n\nderivatives leading to acute \n\nergot toxicity, including \n\nvasospasm and ischaemia. \n\nGI motility agent Cisapride Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of cisapride. \n\nThereby, increasing the risk of \n\nserious arrhythmias from this \n\nagent. \n\n \n\nLipid-modifying agents \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nHMG Co-A reductase \n\ninhibitors \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMicrosomal triglyceride \n\ntransfer protein (MTTP) \n\ninhibitor \n\n \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLomitapide \n\n \n\nIncreased plasma \n\nconcentrations of lovastatin \n\nand simvastatin; thereby, \n\nincreasing the risk of myopathy \n\nincluding rhabdomyolysis (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nIncreased plasma \n\nconcentrations of lomitapide \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\nPDE5 inhibitor Avanafil Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of avanafil (see \n\nsections 4.4. and 4.5). \n\n Sildenafil Contraindicated when used for \n\nthe treatment of pulmonary \n\narterial hypertension (PAH) \n\nonly. \n\nIncreased plasma \n\nconcentrations of sildenafil. \n\nThereby, increasing the \n\npotential for \n\nsildenafil-associated adverse \n\nevents (which include \n\nhypotension and syncope). See \n\nsection 4.4 and section 4.5 for \n\nco-administration of sildenafil \n\nin patients with erectile \n\ndysfunction. \n\n Vardenafil Increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of vardenafil \n\n(see sections 4.4. and 4.5). \n\nSedatives/hypnotics Clorazepate, diazepam, \n\nestazolam, flurazepam, oral \n\nmidazolam and triazolam \n\nIncreased plasma \n\nconcentrations of clorazepate, \n\ndiazepam, estazolam, \n\nflurazepam, oral midazolam \n\nand triazolam. Thereby, \n\nincreasing the risk of extreme \n\nsedation and respiratory \n\ndepression from these agents. \n\n(For caution on parenterally \n\nadministered midazolam, see \n\nsection 4.5.). \n\nRitonavir medicinal product level decreased \n\nHerbal preparation St John\u2019s wort Herbal preparations containing \n\nSt John\u2019s wort (Hypericum \n\nperforatum) due to the risk of \n\ndecreased plasma \n\nconcentrations and reduced \n\nclinical effects of ritonavir (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nRitonavir is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Patients receiving ritonavir or any other \n\nantiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of \n\nHIV-1 infection. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \n\nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \n\nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n\n \n\nWhen ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other PIs, full details on the warnings and \n\nprecautions relevant to that particular PI should be considered, therefore the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics for the particular PI must be consulted. \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n\n \n\nPatients with chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption \n\n \n\nExtra monitoring is recommended when diarrhoea occurs. The relatively high frequency of diarrhoea \n\nduring treatment with ritonavir may compromise the absorption and efficacy (due to decreased \n\ncompliance) of ritonavir or other concurrent medicinal products. Serious persistent vomiting and/or \n\ndiarrhoea associated with ritonavir use might also compromise renal function. It is advisable to \n\nmonitor renal function in patients with renal function impairment. \n\n \n\nHaemophilia \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \n\nhaemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some \n\npatients additional factor VIII was given. In more than a half of the reported cases, treatment with \n\nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \n\nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \n\nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n\n \n\nWeight and metabolic parameters: \n\n \n\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \n\ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \n\nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \n\nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to \n\nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n\n \n\nPancreatitis \n\n \n\nPancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or \n\nabnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of \n\npancreatitis should occur. Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and \n\nritonavir therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome \n\n \n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic \n\npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \n\nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \n\nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \n\nand Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \n\ntreatment instituted when necessary. \n\n \n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \n\noccur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \n\ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n\nLiver disease \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nRitonavir should not be given to patients with decompensated liver disease (see section 4.2). Patients \n\nwith chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased \n\nrisk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy \n\nfor hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n\n \n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \n\nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \n\nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \n\npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n\n \n\nRenal disease \n\n \n\nSince the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not \n\nexpected in patients with renal impairment (see also section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy \n\n(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) \n\nin clinical practice (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis \n\n \n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \n\nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \n\nreported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \n\njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n\n \n\nPR interval prolongation \n\n \n\nRitonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some \n\nhealthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with \n\nunderlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients \n\nreceiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have \n\nbeen reported in patients receiving ritonavir. Ritonavir should be used with caution in such patients \n\n(see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nInteractions with other medicinal products \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n\nThe following warnings and precautions should be considered when ritonavir is used as an \n\nantiretroviral agent. When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the 100 mg and 200 mg \n\nlevel it cannot be assumed that the following warnings and precautions will also apply. When ritonavir \n\nis used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, full details on the warnings and precautions relevant to that \n\nparticular PI must be considered, therefore the Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.4, for \n\nthe particular PI must be consulted to determine if the information below is applicable. \n\n \n\nPDE5 inhibitors \n\nParticular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction in patients receiving ritonavir. Co-administration of ritonavir with these medicinal \n\nproducts is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated adverse \n\nreactions such as hypotension and prolonged erection (see section 4.5). Concomitant use of avanafil or \n\nvardenafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of sildenafil with \n\nritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A for \n\nmetabolism, thus concomitant use of ritonavir with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended due \n\nto an increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. Caution must also be exercised and \n\nreduced doses should be considered if ritonavir is used concurrently with atorvastatin, which is \n\nmetabolised to a lesser extent by CYP3A. While rosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, \n\nan elevation of rosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir co-administration. The \n\nmechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition. When used \n\nwith ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest doses of \n\natorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered. The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is \n\nnot dependent of CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with ritonavir. If treatment with an HMG-\n\nCoA reductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nColchicine \n\nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \n\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nDigoxin \n\nParticular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients taking digoxin since \n\nco-administration of ritonavir with digoxin is expected to increase digoxin levels. The increased \n\ndigoxin levels may lessen over time (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIn patients who are already taking digoxin when ritonavir is introduced, the digoxin dose should be \n\nreduced to one-half of the patients\u2019 normal dose and patients need to be followed more closely than \n\nusual for several weeks after initiating co-administration of ritonavir and digoxin. \n\n \n\nIn patients who are already taking ritonavir when digoxin is introduced, digoxin should be introduced \n\nmore gradually than usual. Digoxin levels should be monitored more intensively than usual during this \n\nperiod, with dose adjustments made, as necessary, based on clinical, electrocardiographic and digoxin \n\nlevel findings. \n\n \n\nEthinylestradiol \n\nBarrier or other non-hormonal methods of contraception should be considered when administering \n\nritonavir at therapeutic or low doses as ritonavir is likely to reduce the effect and change the uterine \n\nbleeding profile when co-administered with estradiol-containing contraceptives. \n\n \n\nGlucocorticoids \n\nConcomitant use of ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 \n\nis not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic \n\ncorticosteroid effects, including Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nTrazodone \n\nParticular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients using trazodone. Trazodone is \n\na CYP3A4 substrate and co-administration of ritonavir is expected to increase trazodone levels. \n\nAdverse reactions of nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope have been observed in single dose \n\ninteraction studies in healthy volunteers (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nRivaroxaban \n\nIt is not recommended to use ritonavir in patients receiving rivaroxaban, due to the risk of increased \n\nbleeding (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nRiociguat \n\nThe concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in riociguat exposure \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nVorapaxar \n\nThe concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in vorapaxar exposure \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nBedaquiline \n\nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could \n\npotentially increase the risk of bedaquiline-related adverse reactions. Therefore, combination of \n\nbedaquiline with ritonavir should be avoided. However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, \n\nco-administration of bedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution. More frequent \n\nelectrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and \n\nrefer to the bedaquiline Summary of Product Characteristics). \n\n \n\nDelamanid \n\nCo-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (ritonavir) may increase exposure to \n\ndelamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation. Therefore, if \n\nco-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered necessary, very frequent ECG monitoring \n\nthroughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.5 and refer to the \n\ndelamanid Summary of Product Characteristics). \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n\nThe interaction profiles of HIV-protease inhibitors, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are \n\ndependent on the specific co-administered protease inhibitor. \n\n \n\nFor a description of the mechanisms and potential mechanisms contributing to the interaction profile \n\nof the PIs, see section 4.5. Please also review the Summary of Product Characteristics for the \n\nparticular boosted PI. \n\n \n\nSaquinavir \n\nDoses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used. Higher doses of ritonavir have \n\nbeen shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions. Co-administration of \n\nsaquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe adverse reactions, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver \n\ndisorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease. \n\n \n\nSaquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe \n\nhepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicines are given \n\ntogether (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nTipranavir \n\nCo-administration of tipranavir with 200 mg of ritonavir has been associated with reports of clinical \n\nhepatitis and hepatic decompensation including some fatalities. Extra vigilance is warranted in patients \n\nwith chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection, as these patients have an increased risk of \n\nhepatotoxicity. \n\n \n\nDoses of ritonavir lower than 200 mg twice daily should not be used as they might alter the efficacy \n\nprofile of the combination. \n\n \n\nFosamprenavir \n\nCo-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily has not \n\nbeen clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of the \n\ncombination and therefore is not recommended. \n\n \n\nAtazanavir \n\nCo-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been \n\nclinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir \n\n(cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and therefore is not recommended. Only when atazanavir with \n\nritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200 mg once daily could be \n\nconsidered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted. Refer to the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics for atazanavir for further details. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n\n\n12 \n\nThis medicinal product contains 87.75 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 4.4% of the WHO \n\nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  \n\n \n\nThe maximum daily dose of this product is equivalent to 53% of the WHO recommended maximum \n\ndaily intake for sodium. \n\n \n\nRitonavir is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken into account for those on a \n\nlow sodium diet. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent \n\n \n\nRitonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation \n\nwith the following ranked order: CYP3A4 > CYP2D6. Co-administration of ritonavir and medicinal \n\nproducts primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other \n\nmedicinal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects. For selected \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. alprazolam) the inhibitory effects of ritonavir on CYP3A4 may decrease over \n\ntime. Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P-glycoprotein and may inhibit this transporter. The \n\ninhibitory effect of ritonavir (with or without other protease inhibitors) on P-gp activity may decrease \n\nover time (e.g. digoxin and fexofenadine-see table \u201cRitonavir effects on non-antiretroviral medicinal \n\nproducts\u201d below). Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, \n\nCYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products \n\nmetabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal \n\nproducts, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect. \n\n \n\nImportant information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used as a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the \n\nco-administered protease inhibitor. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that affect ritonavir levels \n\n \n\nSerum levels of ritonavir can be reduced by concomitant use of herbal preparations containing St \n\nJohn\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). This is due to the induction of medicinal product metabolising \n\nenzymes by St John\u2019s wort. Herbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort must not be used in \n\ncombination with ritonavir. If a patient is already taking St John\u2019s wort, St John\u2019s wort should be \n\nstopped and if possible check viral levels. Ritonavir levels may increase on stopping St John\u2019s wort. \n\nThe dose of ritonavir may need adjusting. The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks after \n\ncessation of treatment with St John\u2019s wort (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nSerum levels of ritonavir may be affected by select co-administered medicinal products (e.g. \n\ndelavirdine, efavirenz, phenytoin and rifampicin). These interactions are noted in the medicinal \n\nproduct interaction tables below. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that are affected by the use of ritonavir \n\n \n\nInteractions between ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease \n\ninhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below.

Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is \n\nrecommended when these medicines are concomitantly \n\nadministered with antiretroviral doses of ritonavir (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDesipramine 100, single oral \n\ndose \n\n500 q12 h \u2191 145% \u2191 22% \n\n The AUC and Cmax of the 2-hydroxy metabolite were decreased \n\n15 and 67%, respectively. Dosage reduction of desipramine is \n\nrecommended when co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an \n\nantiretroviral agent. \n\n \n\nTrazodone 50, single dose 200 q12 h \u2191 2.4-fold \u2191 34% \n\n An increase in the incidence in trazodone-related adverse reactions \n\nwas noted when co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an \n\nantiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. If trazodone \n\nis co-administered with ritonavir, the combination should be used \n\nwith caution, initiating trazodone at the lowest dosage and \n\nmonitoring for clinical response and tolerability. \n\n \n\nAnti-gout treatments     \n\nColchicine Concentrations of colchicine are expected to increase when \n\nco-administered with ritonavir. \n\nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in \n\npatients treated with colchicine and ritonavir (CYP3A4 and P-gp \n\ninhibition) in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.3 and 4.4). Refer to the colchicine prescribing \n\ninformation. \n\n \n\nAntihistamines     \n\nAstemizole, terfenadine Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of astemizole and terfenadine and is therefore \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nFexofenadine Ritonavir may modify P-glycoprotein mediated fexofenadine efflux \n\nwhen dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic \n\nenhancer resulting in increased concentrations of fexofenadine. \n\nIncreased fexofenadine levels may lessen over time as induction \n\ndevelops. \n\n \n\nLoratadine Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an \n\nantiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to \n\n\n\n19 \n\nCo-administered Medicinal \n\nProducts \n\nDose of Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \n\nritonavir \n\n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts AUC \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts \n\nCmax \n\nincrease the plasma concentrations of loratadine. Careful \n\nmonitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when \n\nloratadine is concomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n\n \n\nAnti-infectives     \n\nFusidic acid Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of both fusidic acid and ritonavir and is therefore \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nRifabutin1 150 daily 500 q12 h \u2191 4-fold \u2191 2.5-fold \n\n \n\n25-O-desacetyl rifabutin metabolite   \u2191 38-fold \u2191 16-fold \n\n Due to the large increase in rifabutin AUC, the concomitant use of \n\nrifabutin with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). The reduction of the rifabutin \n\ndose to 150 mg 3 times per week may be indicated for select PIs \n\nwhen co-administered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. \n\nThe Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered \n\nprotease inhibitor should be consulted for specific \n\nrecommendations. \n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the \n\nappropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients. \n\n \n\nRifampicin Although rifampicin may induce metabolism of ritonavir, limited \n\ndata indicate that when high doses of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) \n\nis co-administered with rifampicin, the additional inducing effect of \n\nrifampicin (next to that of ritonavir itself) is small and may have no \n\nclinical relevant effect on ritonavir levels in high-dose ritonavir \n\ntherapy. \n\nThe effect of ritonavir on rifampicin is not known. \n\n \n\nVoriconazole 200 q12 h 400 q12 h \u2193 82% \u2193 66% \n\n 200 q12 h 100 q12 h \u2193 39% \u2193 24% \n\n Concomitant use of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent and \n\nvoriconazole is contraindicated due to reduction in voriconazole \n\nconcentrations (see section 4.3). Co-administration of voriconazole \n\nand ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer should be \n\navoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient \n\njustifies the use of voriconazole. \n\n \n\nAtovaquone Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an \n\nantiretroviral agent induces glucuronidation and as a result is \n\nexpected to decrease the plasma concentrations of atovaquone. \n\nCareful monitoring of serum levels or therapeutic effects is \n\nrecommended when atovaquone is concomitantly administered with \n\nritonavir. \n\n \n\nBedaquiline No interaction study is available with ritonavir only. In an \n\ninteraction study of single-dose bedaquiline and multiple dose \n\nlopinavir/ritonavir, the AUC of bedaquiline was increased by 22%. \n\nThis increase is likely due to ritonavir and a more pronounced effect \n\nmay be observed during prolonged co-administration. Due to the \n\nrisk of bedaquiline related adverse events, co-administration should \n\nbe avoided. If the benefit outweighs the risk, co-administration of \n\nbedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution. More \n\nfrequent electrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of \n\ntransaminases is recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the \n\nbedaquiline Summary of Product Characteristics). \n\n\n\n20 \n\nCo-administered Medicinal \n\nProducts \n\nDose of Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \n\nritonavir \n\n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts AUC \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts \n\nCmax \n\n \n\nClarithromycin 500 q12 h 200 q8 h \u2191 77% \u2191 31% \n\n \n\n14-OH clarithromycin metabolite   \u2193 100% \u2193 99% \n\n Due to the large therapeutic window of clarithromycin no dose \n\nreduction should be necessary in patients with normal renal \n\nfunction. \n\nClarithromycin doses greater than 1 g per day should not be \n\nco-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as \n\na pharmacokinetic enhancer. For patients with renal impairment, a \n\nclarithromycin dose reduction should be considered: for patients \n\nwith creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 ml/min the dose should be \n\nreduced by 50%, for patients with creatinine clearance less than \n\n30 ml/min the dose should be reduced by 75%. \n\n \n\nDelamanid No interaction study is available with ritonavir only. In a healthy \n\nvolunteer drug interaction study of delamanid 100 mg twice daily \n\nand lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily for 14 days, the \n\nexposure of the delamanid metabolite DM-6705 was 30% \n\nincreased. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation associated with \n\nDM-6705, if co-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is \n\nconsidered necessary, very frequent ECG monitoring throughout the \n\nfull delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.4 \n\nand refer to the delamanid Summary of Product Characteristics) \n\n \n\nErythromycin, itraconazole Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an \n\nantiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to \n\nincrease the plasma concentrations of erythromycin and \n\nitraconazole. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects \n\nis recommended when erythromycin or itraconazole is used \n\nconcomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n\n \n\nKetoconazole 200 daily 500 q12 h \u2191 3.4-fold \u2191 55% \n\n Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A-mediated metabolism of ketoconazole. \n\nDue to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and hepatic \n\nadverse reactions, a dose reduction of ketoconazole should be \n\nconsidered when co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an \n\nantiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. \n\n \n\nSulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim2 800/160, single \n\ndose \n\n500 q12 h \u2193 20%/\u2191 20% \u2194 \n\n Dose alteration of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim during \n\nconcomitant ritonavir therapy should not be necessary. \n\n \n\nAntipsychotics/Neuroleptics     \n\nClozapine, pimozide Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of clozapine or pimozide and is therefore \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHaloperidol, risperidone, \n\nthioridazine \n\nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit \n\nCYP2D6 and as a result is expected to increase concentrations of \n\nhaloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine. Careful monitoring of \n\ntherapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when these \n\nmedicines are concomitantly administered with antiretroviral doses \n\nof ritonavir. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nCo-administered Medicinal \n\nProducts \n\nDose of Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \n\nritonavir \n\n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts AUC \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts \n\nCmax \nLurasidone Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of lurasidone are \n\nexpected to increase. The concomitant administration with lurasidone is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nQuetiapine Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of quetiapine \n\nare expected to increase. Concomitant administration of ritonavir \n\nand quetiapine is contraindicated as it may increase \n\nquetiapine-related toxicity (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\n\u03b22-agonist (long acting)     \n\nSalmeterol Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result a pronounced increase in \n\nthe plasma concentrations of salmeterol is expected. Therefore \n\nconcomitant use is not recommended. \n\n \n\nCalcium channel antagonists     \n\nAmlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an \n\nantiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to \n\nincrease the plasma concentrations of calcium channel antagonists. \n\nCareful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is \n\nrecommended when these medicines are concomitantly \n\nadministered with ritonavir. \n\n \n\nEndothelin antagonists     \n\nBosentan Co-administration of bosentan and ritonavir may increase steady \n\nstate bosentan maximum concentrations (Cmax) and area under the \n\ncurve (AUC). \n\n \n\nRiociguat Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A and P-gp \n\ninhibition by ritonavir. The co-administration of riociguat with \n\nritonavir is not recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to riociguat \n\nSmPC). \n\n \n\nErgot derivatives     \n\nDihydroergotamine, ergonovine, \n\nergotamine, methylergonovine \n\nRitonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of ergot derivatives and is therefore contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nGI motility agent     \n\nCisapride Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of cisapride and is therefore contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nHCV Direct Acting Antiviral  \n\nGlecaprevir/pibrentasvir Serum concentrations may be increased due to P-glycoprotein, \n\nBCRP and OATP1B inhibition by ritonavir. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and \n\nritonavir is not recommended due to an increased risk of ALT \n\nelevations associated with increased glecaprevir exposure. \n\n \n\nHCV protease inhibitor     \n\nSimeprevir 200 qd 100 q12 h \u2191 7.2-fold \u2191 4.7-fold \n\n Ritonavir increases plasma concentrations of simeprevir as a result \n\nof CYP3A4 inhibition. It is not recommended to co-administer \n\nritonavir with simeprevir. \n\n \n\nHMG co-A reductase inhibitors     \n\n\n\n22 \n\nCo-administered Medicinal \n\nProducts \n\nDose of Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \n\nritonavir \n\n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts AUC \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts \n\nCmax \n\nAtorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, \n\npravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin \n\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on \n\nCYP3A metabolism, such as lovastatin and simvastatin, are \n\nexpected to have markedly increased plasma concentrations when \n\nco-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as \n\na pharmacokinetic enhancer. Since increased concentrations of \n\nlovastatin and simvastatin may predispose patients to myopathies, \n\nincluding rhabdomyolysis, the combination of these medicinal \n\nproducts with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\nAtorvastatin is less dependent on CYP3A for metabolism. While \n\nrosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, an elevation \n\nof rosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir \n\nco-administration. The mechanism of this interaction is not clear, \n\nbut may be the result of transporter inhibition. \n\nWhen used with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or \n\nas an antiretroviral agent, the lowest possible doses of atorvastatin \n\nor rosuvastatin should be administered. The metabolism of \n\npravastatin and fluvastatin is not dependent on CYP3A, and \n\ninteractions are not expected with ritonavir. If treatment with an \n\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or \n\nfluvastatin is recommended. \n\n \n\nHormonal contraceptive     \n\nEthinylestradiol 50 \u03bcg, single \n\ndose \n\n500 q12 h \u2193 40% \u2193 32% \n\n Due to reductions in ethinylestradiol concentrations, barrier or other \n\nnon-hormonal methods of contraception should be considered with \n\nconcomitant ritonavir use when dosed as an antiretroviral agent or \n\nas a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Ritonavir is likely to change the \n\nuterine bleeding profile and reduce the effectiveness of \n\nestradiol-containing contraceptives (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmunosuppressants     \n\nCyclosporine, tacrolimus, \n\neverolimus \n\nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an \n\nantiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to \n\nincrease the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, tacrolimus or \n\neverolimus. \n\nCareful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is \n\nrecommended when these medicines are concomitantly \n\nadministered with ritonavir. \n\n \n\nLipid-modifying agents  \n\nLomitapide CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of lomitapide, with strong \n\ninhibitors increasing exposure approximately 27-fold.  Due to \n\nCYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of lomitapide are \n\nexpected to increase.  Concomitant use of ritonavir with lomitapide \n\nis contraindicated (see prescribing information for lomitapide) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\nPhosphodiesterase (PDE5) \n\ninhibitors \n\n    \n\nAvanafil 50, single dose 600 q12 h \u2191 13-fold \u2191 2.4-fold \n\n Concomitant use of avanafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nSildenafil 100, single dose 500 q12 h \u2191 11-fold \u2191 4-fold \n\n Concomitant use of sildenafil for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer should be with caution and in no instance \n\n\n\n23 \n\nCo-administered Medicinal \n\nProducts \n\nDose of Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \n\nritonavir \n\n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts AUC \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts \n\nCmax \n\nshould sildenafil doses exceed 25 mg in 48 hours (see also section \n\n4.4). Concomitant use of sildenafil with ritonavir is \n\ncontraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nTadalafil 20, single dose 200 q12 h \u2191 124% \u2194 \n\n The concomitant use of tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer should be with caution at reduced doses \n\nof no more than 10 mg tadalafil every 72 hours with increased \n\nmonitoring for adverse reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nWhen tadalafil is used concurrently with ritonavir in patients with \n\npulmonary arterial hypertension, refer to the tadalafil Summary of \n\nProduct Characteristics. \n\n \n\nVardenafil 5, single dose 600 q12 h \u2191 49-fold \u2191 13-fold \n\n Concomitant use of vardenafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nSedatives/hypnotics     \n\nClorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, \n\nflurazepam, oral and parenteral \n\nmidazolam \n\nRitonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam \n\nand is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\nMidazolam is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4. \n\nCo-administration with ritonavir may cause a large increase in the \n\nconcentration of this benzodiazepine. No medicinal product \n\ninteraction study has been performed for the co-administration of \n\nritonavir with benzodiazepines. \n\nBased on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations \n\nof midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when \n\nmidazolam is given orally. Therefore, ritonavir should not be \n\nco-administered with orally administered midazolam (see section \n\n4.3), whereas caution should be used with co-administration of \n\nritonavir and parenteral midazolam. Data from concomitant use of \n\nparenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a \n\npossible 3 \u2013 4 fold increase in midazolam plasma levels. If ritonavir \n\nis co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in \n\nan intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close \n\nclinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of \n\nrespiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage \n\nadjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more \n\nthan a single dose of midazolam is administered. \n\n \n\nTriazolam 0.125, single \n\ndose \n\n200, 4 doses \u2191 > 20 fold \u2191 87% \n\n Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \n\nconcentrations of triazolam and is therefore contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nPethidine 50, oral single \n\ndose \n\n500 q12 h \u2193 62% \u2193 59% \n\nNorpethidine metabolite   \u2191 47% \u2191 87% \n\n The use of pethidine and ritonavir is contraindicated due to the \n\nincreased concentrations of the metabolite, norpethidine, which has \n\nboth analgesic and CNS stimulant activity. Elevated norpethidine \n\nconcentrations may increase the risk of CNS effects (e.g., seizures), \n\nsee section 4.3. \n\n\n\n24 \n\nCo-administered Medicinal \n\nProducts \n\nDose of Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \n\nritonavir \n\n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts AUC \n\nEffect on Co-\n\nadministered \n\nMedicinal \n\nProducts \n\nCmax \n\n \n\nAlprazolam 1, single dose 200 q12 h, \n\n2 days \n\n\u2191 2.5 fold \u2194 \n\n  500 q12 h, \n\n10 days \n\n\u2193 12% \u2193 16% \n\n Alprazolam metabolism was inhibited following the introduction of \n\nritonavir.

Concurrent \n\nadministration of bupropion with repeated doses of ritonavir is \n\nexpected to decrease bupropion levels. These effects are thought to \n\nrepresent induction of bupropion metabolism. However, because \n\nritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro, the \n\nrecommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. In \n\ncontrast to long-term administration of ritonavir, there was no \n\nsignificant interaction with bupropion after short-term \n\nadministration of low doses of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for \n\n2 days), suggesting reductions in bupropion concentrations may \n\nhave onset several days after initiation of ritonavir \n\nco-administration. \n\n \n\nSteroids     \n\nInhaled, injectable or intranasal \n\nfluticasone propionate, budesonide, \n\ntriamcinolone \n\nSystemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and \n\nadrenal suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be \n\ndecreased 86% in the above study) have been reported in patients \n\nreceiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal fluticasone propionate; \n\nsimilar effects could also occur with other corticosteroids \n\nmetabolised by CYP3A e.g., budesonide and triamcinolone. \n\nConsequently, concomitant administration of ritonavir dosed as an \n\nantiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these \n\nglucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of \n\ntreatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see \n\nsection 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be \n\nconsidered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a \n\nswitch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 \n\n(e.g., beclomethasone).

The possibility of medicinal product interaction cannot be \n\nexcluded. \n\n \n\nIn addition to the interactions listed above, as ritonavir is highly protein bound, the possibility of \n\nincreased therapeutic and toxic effects due to protein binding displacement of concomitant medicinal \n\nproducts should be considered. \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n\n \n\nImportant information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the \n\nco-administered protease inhibitor. \n\n \n\nProton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists \n\nProton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. omeprazole or ranitidine) may reduce \n\nconcentrations for co-administered protease inhibitors. For specific information regarding the impact \n\nof co-administration of acid reducing agents, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the \n\nco-administered protease inhibitor. Based on interaction studies with the ritonavir boosted protease \n\ninhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir), concurrent administration of omeprazole or ranitidine does \n\nnot significantly modify ritonavir efficacy as a pharmacokinetic enhancer despite a slight change of \n\nexposure (about 6 - 18%). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nA large amount (6100 live births) of pregnant women were exposed to ritonavir during pregnancy; of \n\nthese, 2800 live births were exposed during the first trimester. These data largely refer to exposures \n\n\n\n26 \n\nwhere ritonavir was used in combination therapy and not at therapeutic ritonavir doses but at lower \n\ndoses as a pharmacokinetic enhancer for other PIs. These data indicate no increase in the rate of birth \n\ndefects compared to rates observed in population-based birth defect surveillance systems. Animal data \n\nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ritonavir can be used during pregnancy if \n\nclinically needed.   \n\n \n\nRitonavir adversely interacts with oral contraceptives (OCs). Therefore, an alternative, effective and \n\nsafe method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nLimited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk. \n\n \n\nThere is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on \n\nmilk production.  Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) \n\ndeveloping viral resistance (in HIV-postive infants) and (3) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed \n\ninfant,  HIV infected women should not breast feed their infants under any circumstances if they are \n\nreceiving ritonavir. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo human data on the effect of ritonavir on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate \n\nharmful effects of ritonavir on fertility (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Dizziness is a \n\nknown undesirable effect that should be taken into account when driving or using machinery. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n\nAdverse reactions associated with the use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer are dependent on \n\nthe specific co-administered PI. For information on adverse reactions refer to the SPC of the specific \n\nco-administered PI. \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience in adult patients \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions among patients receiving ritonavir alone or in \n\ncombination with other antiretroviral drugs were gastrointestinal (including diarrhoea, nausea, \n\nvomiting, abdominal pain (upper and lower)), neurological disturbances (including paraesthesia and \n\noral paraesthesia) and fatigue/asthenia. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity with possible or probable relationship \n\nto ritonavir have been reported. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in \n\norder of decreasing seriousness: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). \n\n \n\nEvents noted as having frequency not known were identified via post-marketing surveillance. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nAdverse reactions in clinical studies and post-marketing in adult patients \n\nSystem Order Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUncommon \n\nDecreased white blood cells, decreased \n\nhaemoglobin, decreased neutrophils, \n\nincreased eosinophils, thrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nIncreased neutrophils \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders Common \n\n \n\n \n\nRare \n\nHypersensitivity including urticaria, and \n\nface oedema \n\n \n\nAnaphylaxis \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUncommon \n\n \n\nRare \n\nHypercholesterolaemia, \n\nhypertriglyceridaemia, gout, oedema and \n\nperipheral oedema, dehydration (usually \n\nassociated with gastrointestinal \n\nsymptoms) \n\n \n\nDiabetes mellitus \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders Very common \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCommon \n\nDysgeusia, oral and peripheral \n\nparaesthesia, headache, dizziness, \n\nperipheral neuropathy \n\n \n\nInsomnia, anxiety, confusion, disturbance \n\nin attention, syncope, seizure \n\n \n\nEye disorders Common Blurred vision \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Myocardial infarction \n\n \n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension, hypotension including \n\northostatic hypotension, peripheral \n\ncoldness \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nVery common Pharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, cough \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCommon \n\nAbdominal pain (upper and lower), \n\nnausea, diarrhoea (including severe with \n\nelectrolyte imbalance), vomiting, \n\ndyspepsia \n\n \n\nAnorexia, flatulence, mouth ulcer, \n\ngastrointestinal haemorrhage, \n\ngastroesophageal reflux disease, \n\npancreatitis \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common Hepatitis (including increased AST, ALT, \n\nGGT), blood bilirubin increased \n\n(including jaundice) \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common \n\n \n\n \n\nCommon \n\n \n\nRare \n\nPruritus, rash (including erythematous and \n\nmaculopapular) \n\n \n\nAcne \n\n \n\nStevens Johnson syndrome, toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders \n\nVery common \n\n \n\nCommon \n\nArthralgia and back pain \n\n \n\nMyositis, rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, \n\nmyopathy/CPK increased \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUncommon \n\nIncreased urination, renal impairment (e.g. \n\noliguria, elevated creatinine) \n\n \n\nAcute renal failure \n\n \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Menorrhagia \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common \n\n \n\n \n\nCommon \n\nFatigue including asthenia, flushing, \n\nfeeling hot \n\n \n\nFever, weight loss \n\n \n\nInvestigations Common \n\n \n\n \n\nUncommon \n\nIncreased amylase, decreased free and \n\ntotal thyroxin \n\n \n\nIncreased glucose, increased magnesium, \n\nincreased alkaline phosphatase \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHepatic transaminase elevations exceeding five times the upper limit or normal, clinical hepatitis, and \n\njaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir alone or in combination with other \n\nantiretrovirals. \n\n \n\nMetabolic parameters \n\n \n\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \n\ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \n\nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months \n\nafter initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving ritonavir therapy, including those who developed \n\nhypertriglyceridemia. In some cases fatalities have been observed. Patients with advanced HIV disease \n\nmay be at risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \n\nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \n\nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric populations \n\nThe safety profile of ritonavir in children 2 years of age and older is similar to that seen in adults. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nHuman experience of acute overdose with ritonavir is limited. One patient in clinical trials took \n\nritonavir 1,500 mg/day for two days and reported paraesthesia, which resolved after the dose was \n\ndecreased. A case of renal failure with eosinophilia has been reported. \n\n \n\nThe signs of toxicity observed in animals (mice and rats) included decreased activity, ataxia, dyspnoea \n\nand tremors. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with ritonavir. Treatment of overdose with ritonavir should \n\nconsist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \n\nclinical status of the patient. Due to the solubility characteristics and possibility of transintestinal \n\nelimination, it is proposed that management of overdose could entail gastric lavage and administration \n\nof activated charcoal. Since ritonavir is extensively metabolised by the liver and is highly protein \n\nbound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors ATC code: J05AE03. \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic enhancement by ritonavir is based on ritonavir\u2019s activity as a potent inhibitor of \n\nCYP3A- mediated metabolism. The degree of enhancement is related to the metabolic pathway of the \n\nco-administered protease inhibitor and the impact of the co-administered protease inhibitor on the \n\nmetabolism of ritonavir. Maximal inhibition of metabolism of the co-administered protease inhibitor is \n\ngenerally achieved with ritonavir doses of 100 mg daily to 200 mg twice daily, and is dependent on \n\nthe co-administered protease inhibitor. For additional information on the effect of ritonavir on \n\nco-administered protease inhibitor metabolism, see section 4.5 and refer to the Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics of the particular co-administered PIs. \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n\n \n\nRitonavir is an orally active peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 aspartyl proteases. \n\nInhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the gag-pol polyprotein \n\nprecursor which leads to the production of HIV particles with immature morphology that are unable to \n\ninitiate new rounds of infection. Ritonavir has selective affinity for the HIV protease and has little \n\ninhibitory activity against human aspartyl proteases. \n\n \n\nRitonavir was the first protease inhibitor (approved in 1996) for which efficacy was proven in a study \n\nwith clinical endpoints. However, due to ritonavir\u2019s metabolic inhibitory properties its use as a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer of other protease inhibitors is the prevalent use of ritonavir in clinical \n\npractice (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nEffects on the electrocardiogram \n\n \n\nQTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) \n\ncontrolled crossover study in 45 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3. The \n\nmaximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo was 5.5 (7.6) for \n\n400 mg twice daily ritonavir. The Day 3 ritonavir exposure was approximately 1.5 fold higher than \n\nthat observed with the 600 mg twice daily dose at steady state. No subject experienced an increase in \n\n\n\n30 \n\nQTcF of \u2265 60 msec from baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant \n\nthreshold of 500 msec. \n\n \n\nModest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving ritonavir in the same study \n\non Day 3. The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.0 to 24.0 msec in the \n\n12 hour interval post dose. Maximum PR interval was 252 msec and no second or third degree heart \n\nblock was observed (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nResistance \n\n \n\nRitonavir-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in vitro and isolated from patients treated with \n\ntherapeutic doses of ritonavir. \n\n \n\nReduction in the antiretroviral activity of ritonavir is primarily associated with the protease mutations \n\nV82A/F/T/S and I84V. Accumulation of other mutations in the protease gene (including at positions \n\n20, 33, 36, 46, 54, 71, and 90) can also contribute to ritonavir resistance. In general, as mutations \n\nassociated with ritonavir resistance accumulate, susceptibility to select other PIs may decrease due to \n\ncross-resistance. The Summary of Product Characteristics of other protease inhibitors or official \n\ncontinuous updates should be consulted for specific information regarding protease mutations \n\nassociated with reduced response to these agents. \n\n \n\nClinical pharmacodynamic data \n\n \n\nThe effects of ritonavir (alone or combined with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers of \n\ndisease activity such as CD4 cell count and viral RNA were evaluated in several studies involving \n\nHIV-1 infected patients. The following studies are the most important. \n\n \n\nAdult Use \n\nA controlled study completed in 1996 with ritonavir as add-on therapy in HIV-1 infected patients \n\nextensively pre-treated with nucleoside analogues and baseline CD4 cell counts \u2264 100 cells/\u03bcl showed \n\na reduction in mortality and AIDS defining events. The mean average change from baseline over \n\n16 weeks for HIV RNA levels was -0.79 log10 (maximum mean decrease: 1.29 log10) in the ritonavir \n\ngroup versus -0.01 log10 in the control group. The most frequently used nucleosides in this study were \n\nzidovudine, stavudine, didanosine and zalcitabine. \n\n \n\nIn a study completed in 1996 recruiting less advanced HIV-1 infected patients (CD4 200-500 cells/\u03bcl) \n\nwithout previous antiretroviral therapy, ritonavir in combination with zidovudine or alone reduced \n\nviral load in plasma and increased CD4 count. The mean average change from baseline over 48 weeks \n\nfor HIV RNA levels was -0.88 log10 in the ritonavir group versus -0.66 log10 in the ritonavir + \n\nzidovudine group versus -0.42 log10 in the zidovudine group. \n\n \n\nThe continuation of ritonavir therapy should be evaluated by viral load because of the possibility of \n\nthe emergence of resistance as described under section 4.1. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Use \n\nIn an open label trial completed in 1998 in HIV infected, clinically stable children there was a \n\nsignificant difference (p = 0.03) in the detectable RNA levels in favour of a triple regimen (ritonavir, \n\nzidovudine and lamivudine) following 48 weeks treatment. \n\n \n\nIn a study completed in 2003, 50 HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor and lamivudine na\u00efve children age \n\n4 weeks to 2 years received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 every 12 hours co-administered with \n\nzidovudine 160 mg/m2 every 8 hours and lamivudine 4 mg/kg every 12 hours. In intent to treat \n\nanalyses, 72% and 36% of patients achieved reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of \u2264 400 copies/ml at \n\nWeek 16 and 104, respectively. Response was similar in both dosing regimens and across patient age. \n\n \n\nIn a study completed in 2000, 76 HIV-1 infected children aged 6 months to 12 years who were \n\nprotease inhibitor naive and naive to lamivudine and/or stavudine received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 \n\n\n\n31 \n\nevery 12 hours co-administered with lamivudine and stavudine. In intent to treat analyses, 50% and \n\n57% of patients in the 350 and 450 mg/m2 dose groups, respectively, achieved reduction in plasma \n\nHIV-1 RNA to \u2264 400 copies/ml at Week 48. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThere is no parenteral formulation of ritonavir, therefore the extent of absorption and absolute \n\nbioavailability have not been determined. The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir during multiple dose \n\nregimens were studied in non-fasting HIV-infected adult volunteers. Upon multiple dosing, ritonavir \n\naccumulation is slightly less than predicted from a single dose due to a time and dose-related increase \n\nin apparent clearance (Cl/F). Trough concentrations of ritonavir decrease over time, possibly due to \n\nenzyme induction, but appeared to stabilise by the end of 2 weeks. The time to maximum \n\nconcentration (Tmax) remained constant at approximately 4 hours with increasing dose. Renal clearance \n\naveraged less than 0.1 l/h and was relatively constant throughout the dosage range. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters observed with various dosing schemes of ritonavir alone are shown \n\nin the table below. Plasma concentrations of ritonavir after administration of a single 100 mg dose \n\ntablet are similar to the 100 mg soft gelatin capsule under fed conditions. \n\n \n\nRitonavir dosing regimen \n\n \n 100 mg once \n\ndaily \n\n100 mg twice \n\ndaily1 \n\n200 mg once \n\ndaily \n\n200 mg twice \n\ndaily \n\n600 mg twice \n\ndaily \n\nCmax (\u03bcg/ml) 0.84 \u00b1 0.39 0.89 3.4 \u00b1 1.3 4.5 \u00b1 1.3 11.2 \u00b1 3.6 \n\nCtrough (\u03bcg/ml) 0.08 \u00b1 0.04 0.22 0.16 \u00b1 0.10 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 3.7 \u00b1 2.6 \n\nAUC12 or 24 \n\n(\u03bcg\u2022h/ml) \n\n6.6 \u00b1 2.4 6.2 20.0 \u00b1 5.6 21.92 \u00b1 6.48 77.5 \u00b1 31.5 \n\nt1/2 (h) ~5 ~5 ~4 ~8 ~3 to 5 \n\nCl/F (L/h) 17.2 \u00b1 6.6 16.1 10.8 \u00b1 3.1 10.0 \u00b1 3.2 8.8 \u00b1 3.2 \n1 Values expressed as geometric means. Note: ritonavir was dosed after a meal for all listed regimens. \n\n \n\nEffects of food on oral absorption \n\n \n\nFood slightly decreases the bioavailability of the ritonavir tablet. Administration of a single 100 mg \n\ndose of ritonavir tablet with a moderate fat meal (857 kcal, 31% calories from fat) or a high fat meal \n\n(907 kcal, 52% calories from fat) was associated with a mean decrease of 20-23% in ritonavir AUC \n\nand Cmax. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution (VB/F) of ritonavir is approximately 20 \u2013 40 l after a single \n\n600 mg dose. The protein binding of ritonavir in human plasma is approximately 98 - 99% and is \n\nconstant over the concentration range of 1.0 \u2013 100 \u03bcg/ml. Ritonavir binds to both human alpha 1-acid \n\nglycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA) with comparable affinities. \n\n \n\nTissue distribution studies with 14C-labelled ritonavir in rats showed the liver, adrenals, pancreas, \n\nkidneys and thyroid to have the highest concentrations of ritonavir. Tissue to plasma ratios of \n\napproximately 1 measured in rat lymph nodes suggests that ritonavir distributes into lymphatic tissues. \n\nRitonavir penetrates minimally into the brain. \n\n \n\nMetabolism \n\n \n\nRitonavir was noted to be extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, primarily \n\nby the CYP3A isozyme family and to a lesser extent by the CYP2D6 isoform. Animal studies as well \n\nas in vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicated that ritonavir primarily underwent \n\noxidative metabolism. Four ritonavir metabolites have been identified in man. The isopropylthiazole \n\n\n\n32 \n\noxidation metabolite (M-2) is the major metabolite and has antiviral activity similar to that of parent \n\ncompound. However, the AUC of the M-2 metabolite was approximately 3% of the AUC of parent \n\ncompound. \n\n \n\nLow doses of ritonavir have shown profound effects on the pharmacokinetics of other protease \n\ninhibitors (and other products metabolised by CYP3A4) and other protease inhibitors may influence \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nHuman studies with radiolabelled ritonavir demonstrated that the elimination of ritonavir was \n\nprimarily via the hepatobiliary system; approximately 86% of radiolabel was recovered from stool, \n\npart of which is expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir. In these studies renal elimination was not found \n\nto be a major route of elimination of ritonavir. This was consistent with the observations in animal \n\nstudies. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nNo clinically significant differences in AUC or Cmax were noted between males and females. Ritonavir \n\npharmacokinetic parameters were not statistically significantly associated with body weight or lean \n\nbody mass. Ritonavir plasma exposures in patients 50 \u2013 70 years of age when dosed 100 mg in \n\ncombination with lopinavir or at higher doses in the absence of other protease inhibitors is similar to \n\nthat observed in younger adults. \n\n \n\nPatients with impaired liver function \n\nAfter multiple dosing of ritonavir to healthy volunteers (500 mg twice daily) and subjects with mild to \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A and B, 400 mg twice daily) exposure to ritonavir \n\nafter dose normalisation was not significantly different between the two groups. \n\n \n\nPatients with impaired renal function \n\nRitonavir pharmacokinetic parameters have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. \n\nHowever, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, no changes in the total body clearance are \n\nexpected in patients with renal impairment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nRitonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children above \n\n2 years of age receiving doses ranging from 250 mg/m2 twice daily to 400 mg/m2 twice daily. \n\nRitonavir concentrations obtained after 350 to 400 mg/m2 twice daily in paediatric patients were \n\ncomparable to those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg (approximately 330 mg/m2) twice daily. \n\nAcross dose groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) was approximately 1.5 to 1.7 times faster in \n\npaediatric patients above 2 years of age than in adult subjects. \n\n \n\nRitonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children less than \n\n2 years of age receiving doses ranging from 350 to 450 mg/m2 twice daily. Ritonavir concentrations in \n\nthis study were highly variable and somewhat lower than those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg \n\n(approximately 330 mg/m2) twice daily. Across dose groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) \n\ndeclined with age with median values of 9.0 L/h/m2 in children less than 3 months of age, 7.8 L/h/m2 \n\nin children between 3 and 6 months of age and 4.4 L/h/m2 in children between 6 and 24 months of age. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRepeated dose toxicity studies in animals identified major target organs as the liver, retina, thyroid \n\ngland and kidney. Hepatic changes involved hepatocellular, biliary and phagocytic elements and were \n\naccompanied by increases in hepatic enzymes. Hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) \n\nand retinal degeneration have been seen in all of the rodent studies conducted with ritonavir, but have \n\nnot been seen in dogs. Ultrastructural evidence suggests that these retinal changes may be secondary to \n\n\n\n33 \n\nphospholipidosis. However, clinical trials revealed no evidence of medicinal product-induced ocular \n\nchanges in humans. All thyroid changes were reversible upon discontinuation of ritonavir. \n\nClinical investigation in humans has revealed no clinically significant alteration in thyroid function \n\ntests. Renal changes including tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation and proteinurea were noted \n\nin rats and are felt to be attributable to species-specific spontaneous disease. Furthermore, no clinically \n\nsignificant renal abnormalities were noted in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity observed in rats (embryolethality, decreased foetal body weight and \n\nossification delays and visceral changes, including delayed testicular descent) occurred mainly at a \n\nmaternally toxic dosage. Developmental toxicity in rabbits (embryolethality, decreased litter size and \n\ndecreased foetal weights) occurred at a maternally toxic dosage. \n\n \n\nRitonavir was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays \n\nincluding the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the mouse \n\nlymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human \n\nlymphocytes. \n\n \n\nLong term carcinogenicity studies of ritonavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential \n\nspecific for these species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Ritonavir Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Ritonavir Mylan \n\n3. How to take Ritonavir Mylan \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Ritonavir Mylan \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Ritonavir Mylan is and what it is used for \nRitonavir Mylan contains the active substance ritonavir. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor used to \n\ncontrol HIV infection. Ritonavir is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines \n\n(antiretrovirals) to control your HIV infection. Your doctor will discuss with you the best combination \n\nof medicines for you. \n\n \n\nRitonavir Mylan is used by children 2 years of age or older, adolescents and adults who are infected \n\nwith HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Ritonavir Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Ritonavir Mylan \n\n- if you are allergic to ritonavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (see section 6). \n- if you have severe liver disease. \n- if you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms \u2013 these medicines \nmay be available without prescription); \n\n- amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, encainide, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine (used to \ncorrect irregular heartbeats); \n\n- dihydroergotamine, ergotamine (used to treat migraine headache); \n- ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to stop excessive bleeding that may occur following \n\nchildbirth or an abortion); \n\n- clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, triazolam or oral (taken by mouth) \nmidazolam (used to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety); \n\n- clozapine, pimozide, (used to treat abnormal thoughts or feelings); \n- quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \n\n\u2212 lurasidone (used to treat depression); \n\n\u2212 ranolazine (used to treat chronic chest pain [angina]); \n- pethidine, piroxicam, propoxyphene (used to relieve pain); \n- cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems); \n\n\n\n52 \n\n- rifabutin (used to prevent/treat certain infections)*; \n- voriconazole (used to treat fungal infections)*; \n- simvastatin, lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol);  \n- neratinib (used to treat breast cancer); \n- lomitapide (used to lower blood cholesterol); \n- alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostate gland); \n- fusidic acid (used to treat bacterial infections); \n- sildenafil if you suffer from a lung disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension that \n\nmakes breathing difficult. Patients without this disease may use sildenafil for impotence \n\n(erectile dysfunction) under their doctor\u2019s supervision (see the section on Other \n\nmedicines and Ritonavir Mylan); \n\n- avanafil or vardenafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction); \n- colchicine (used to treat gout) if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see the section \n\non Other medicines and Ritonavir Mylan); \n\n- products containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) as this may stop ritonavir \nfrom working properly. St John\u2019s wort is often used in herbal medicines that you can buy \n\nyourself. \n\n* Your doctor may decide that you can take rifabutin and/or voriconazole with a booster (lower \n\ndose) of ritonavir but a full dose of ritonavir must not be taken together with these two \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nIf you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about switching to a different \n\nmedicine while you are taking Ritonavir Mylan. \n\n \n\nAlso read the list of medicines under \u2018Other medicines and Ritonavir Mylan\u2019 for use with certain other \n\nmedicines which require special care. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Ritonavir Mylan. \n\n \n\nImportant information \n\n- If Ritonavir Mylan is taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines, it is important \nthat you also carefully read the leaflets that are provided with these other medicines. There may \n\nbe additional information in those leaflets about situations when ritonavir should be avoided. If \n\nyou have any further questions about Ritonavir Mylan (ritonavir) or the other medicines \n\nprescribed, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n- Ritonavir is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS. \n- People taking ritonavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV \n\ninfection or AIDS. It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your doctor \n\nwhile taking Ritonavir Mylan. \n\n- You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting \n\nother people. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you have/had: \n\n \n\n- A history of liver disease. \n- Hepatitis B or C and are being treated with a combination of antiretroviral agents, as you are at \n\na greater risk of a severe and potentially life threatening reaction because of the effect on the \n\nliver. Regular blood tests may be required to check your liver is working properly. \n\n- Haemophilia, as there have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia \nwho are taking this type of medicine (protease inhibitors). The reason for this is not known. \n\nYou may need additional medicine to help your blood clot (factor VIII), in order to control any \n\nbleeding. \n\n- Erectile dysfunction, as the medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction can cause hypotension \nand prolonged erection. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n- Diabetes, as there have been reports of worsening of or the development of diabetes (diabetes \nmellitus) in some patients taking protease inhibitors. \n\n- Kidney (renal) disease, since your doctor may need to check the dose of your other medicines \n(such as protease inhibitors). \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you experience: \n\n \n\n- Diarrhoea or vomiting that is not improving (persistent), as this may reduce how well the \nmedicines you are taking work. \n\n- Feeling sick (nausea), vomiting or have stomach pain, because these may be signs of \ninflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Some patients taking ritonavir can develop serious \n\nproblems with their pancreas. Tell your doctor as soon as possible if this applies to you. \n\n- Symptoms of infection - inform your doctor immediately. Some patients with advanced HIV \ninfection (AIDS) who then start anti-HIV treatment may develop the symptoms of infections \n\nthey have had in the past even if they didn\u2019t know they had had them. It is believed that this \n\nhappens because the body's immune response improves and helps the body to fight these \n\ninfections. \n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \n\nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \n\nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \n\nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \n\nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \n\nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \n\nnecessary treatment. \n\n- Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty \nmoving, tell your doctor, as this may be a sign of a problem that can destroy bone \n\n(osteonecrosis). Some patients taking a number of antiretroviral medicines may develop this \n\ndisease. \n\n- Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with antiretroviral therapy \nincluding protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions these muscle \n\ndisorders have been serious. (See section 4 Possible side effects) \n\n- Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells or abnormal heartbeat. Some patients taking \nritonavir may experience changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Tell your doctor if you have \n\na heart defect or conduction defect. \n\n- If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor as soon as you can. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nRitonavir Mylan is not recommended in children below 2 years of age. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Ritonavir Mylan \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. There are some medicines you cannot \n\ntake at all with ritonavir. These are listed earlier in section 2, under \u2018Do not take Ritonavir Mylan\u2019. \n\nThere are some other medicines that can only be used under certain circumstances as described below. \n\n \n\nThe following warnings apply when Ritonavir Mylan is taken as a full dose. However, these warnings \n\nmay also apply when Ritonavir Mylan is used in lower doses (a booster) with other medicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as special care should be \n\ntaken. \n\n \n\n- Sildenafil or tadalafil for impotence (erectile dysfunction). \nThe dose and/or frequency of use of these medicines may need to be reduced to avoid \n\nhypotension and prolonged erection. You must not take Ritonavir Mylan with sildenafil if you \n\nsuffer from pulmonary arterial hypertension (see also section 2. What you need to know \n\n\n\n54 \n\nbefore you or your child takes Ritonavir Mylan). Tell your doctor if you are taking tadalafil \n\nfor pulmonary arterial hypertension. \n\n- Colchicine (for gout) as ritonavir may raise the blood levels of this medicine. You must not take \nritonavir with colchicine if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see also \u2018Do not take \n\nRitonavir Mylan\u2019 above). \n\n- Digoxin (heart medicine). Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of digoxin and monitor you \nwhile you are taking digoxin and Ritonavir Mylan in order to avoid heart problems. \n\n- Hormonal contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol as ritonavir may reduce the effectiveness \nof these medicines. It is recommended that a condom or other non-hormonal method of \n\ncontraception is used instead. You may also notice irregular uterine bleeding if you are taking \n\nthis type of hormonal contraceptive with ritonavir. \n\n- Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (for high cholesterol) as ritonavir may raise the blood levels of \nthese medicines. Talk to your doctor before you take any cholesterol-reducing medicines with \n\nritonavir (see also \u2018Do not take Ritonavir Mylan\u2019 above). \n\n- Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, prednisolone, triamcinolone) as ritonavir \nmay raise the blood levels of these medicines which may lead to Cushing\u2019s syndrome \n\n(development of a rounded face) and reduce production of the hormone cortisol. Your doctor \n\nmay wish to reduce the steroid dose or monitor your side effects more closely. \n\n- Trazodone (a medicine for depression) as, unwanted effects like nausea, dizziness, low blood \npressure and fainting can occur when taken with ritonavir. \n\n- Rifampicin and saquinavir (used for tuberculosis and HIV, respectively) as serious liver \ndamage can occur when taken with ritonavir. \n\n- Bosentan, riociguat (used for pulmonary arterial hypertension) as ritonavir may increase the \nblood levels of this medicine. \n\n \n\nThere are medicines that may not mix with ritonavir because their effects could increase or decrease \n\nwhen taken together. In some cases your doctor may need to perform certain tests, change the dose or \n\nmonitor you regularly. This is why you should tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines, \n\nincluding those you have bought yourself or herbal products, but it is especially important to mention \n\nthese: \n\n \n\n- amphetamine or amphetamine derivatives; \n- antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin); \n- anticancer treatments (e.g. abemaciclib, afatinib, apalutamide, ceritinib, encorafenib, dasatinib, \n\nibrutinib, nilotinib, venetoclax, vincristine, vinblastine); \n\n- anticoagulants (e.g. rivaroxaban, vorapaxar, warfarin); \n- antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, fluoxetine, imipramine, nefazodone, \n\nnortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone); \n\n- antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole); \n- antihistamines (e.g. loratadine, fexofenadine); \n- antiretroviral medicines including HIV-protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, \n\nfosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors (NNRTI) (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine), and others (didanosine, maraviroc, \n\nraltegravir, zidovudine); \n\n- anti-tuberculosis medicine (bedaquiline and delamanid); \n- antiviral medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (e.g. \n\nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir and simeprevir); \n\n- anxiety medicine, buspirone; \n- asthma medicine, theophylline, salmeterol; \n- atovaquone, a medicine used to treat a certain type of pneumonia and malaria; \n- buprenorphine, a medicine used for the treatment of chronic pain; \n- bupropion, a medicine used to help you stop smoking; \n- epilepsy medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, divalproex, lamotrigine, phenytoin); \n- heart medicines (e.g. disopyramide, mexiletine and calcium channel antagonists such as \n\namlodipine, diltiazem and nifedipine); \n\n- immune system (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus); \n- levothyroxine (used to treat thyroid problems) \n\n\n\n55 \n\n- morphine and morphine-like medicines used to treat severe pain (e.g. methadone, fentanyl); \n- sleeping pills (e.g. alprazolam, zolpidem) and also midazolam administered by injection; \n- tranquillisers (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine); \n- colchicine, a treatment for gout. \n \n\nThere are some medicines you cannot take at all with ritonavir. These are listed earlier in section 2, \n\nunder \u2018Do not take Ritonavir Mylan\u2019. \n\n \n\nTaking Ritonavir Mylan with food and drink \n\n \n\nRitonavir Mylan tablets should be taken with food. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you think you are pregnant or you are planning to become pregnant, it is very important that \n\nyou discuss this with your doctor. \n\n \n\nThere is a large amount of information on the use of ritonavir (the active ingredient in Ritonavir \n\nMylan) during pregnancy. In general, pregnant mothers received ritonavir after the first three months \n\nof pregnancy at a lower dose (booster) along with other protease inhibitors. Ritonavir did not appear to \n\nincrease the chance of developing birth defects compared to the general population. \n\n \n\nRitonavir can pass into breast milk. To avoid transmitting the infection, mothers with HIV must not \n\nbreast-feed their babies. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nRitonavir Mylan can cause dizziness. If you are affected do not drive or use machinery. \n\n \n\nRitonavir Mylan contains sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains 87.75 mg of sodium in each tablet. This is equivalent to 4.4% of the \n\nrecommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you need five or more tablets daily for a prolonged period, especially if you have been advised to \n\nfollow a low salt (sodium) diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Ritonavir Mylan \n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. Take this medicine one or two times a day every day with food. \n\n \n\nIt is important that Ritonavir Mylan tablets are swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. \n\n \n\nRecommended doses of Ritonavir Mylan are: \n\n\u2022 if Ritonavir Mylan is used to boost the effects of certain other anti-HIV medicines the typical \ndose for adults is 1 to 2 tablets once or twice daily. For more detailed dose recommendations, \n\nincluding those for children, see the Package Leaflet of the anti-HIV medicines Ritonavir Mylan \n\nis given in combination with. \n\n\u2022 if your doctor prescribes a full dose, adults may be started on a dose of 3 tablets in the morning \nand 3 tablets 12 hours later, gradually increasing over a period of up to 14 days to the full dose \n\nof 6 tablets twice daily (totalling 1,200 mg per day). Children (2 - 12 years of age) will start \n\nwith a dose smaller than this and continue up to the maximum allowed for their size. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will advise you on the dosage to be taken. \n\n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nOther forms of this medicine may be more appropriate for children who have difficulty swallowing \n\ntablets. \n\n \n\nRitonavir Mylan should be taken every day to help control your HIV, no matter how much better you \n\nfeel. If a side effect is preventing you from taking Ritonavir Mylan as directed, tell your doctor \n\nstraight away. During episodes of diarrhoea your doctor may decide that extra monitoring is needed. \n\n \n\nAlways keep enough Ritonavir Mylan on hand so you don't run out. When you travel or need to stay \n\nin the hospital, make sure you have enough Ritonavir Mylan to last until you can get a new supply. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Ritonavir Mylan than you should \n\n \n\nNumbness, tingling, or a \u201cpins and needles\u201d sensation may occur if you take too much ritonavir. If you \n\nrealise you have taken more Ritonavir Mylan than you were supposed to, contact your doctor or the \n\nAccident and Emergency Department of your nearest hospital straight away. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Ritonavir Mylan \n\n \n\nIf you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible. If it is nearly time for the next dose, just \n\ntake that one. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Ritonavir Mylan \n\n \n\nEven if you feel better, do not stop taking Ritonavir Mylan without talking to your doctor. Taking \n\nRitonavir Mylan as recommended should give you the best chance of delaying resistance to the \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \n\nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \n\nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Also, the \n\nside effects of ritonavir when used with other antiretroviral medicines are dependent on the other \n\nmedicines. \n\nSo it is important that you carefully read the side effects section of the leaflets that are provided with \n\nthese other medicines. \n\n \n\nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\n \n\n\u2022 upper or lower stomach ache \n\n\u2022 vomiting \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea (may be severe) \n\n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\n\u2022 flushing, feeling hot \n\n\u2022 headache \n\n\u2022 dizziness \n\n\u2022 pain in the throat \n\n\u2022 cough \n\n\u2022 upset stomach or indigestion \n\n\u2022 a tingling sensation or numbness in the \nhands, feet or around the lips and mouth \n\n\u2022 feeling weak/tired \n\n\u2022 bad taste in the mouth \n\n\u2022 damage to the nerves that can cause \nweakness and pain \n\n\u2022 itching \n\n\u2022 rash \n\n\u2022 joint pain and back pain \n\n \n\nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n\u2022 allergic reactions including skin rashes \n(may be red, raised, itchy), severe \n\nswelling of the skin and other tissues \n\n\u2022 inability to sleep (insomnia) \n\n\u2022 anxiety \n\n\u2022 increase in cholesterol \n\n\u2022 increase in triglycerides \n\n\u2022 gout \n\n\u2022 stomach bleeding \n\n\u2022 inflammation of the liver and yellowing \nof skin or whites of the eyes \n\n\u2022 increase in urination \n\n\u2022 reduced kidney function \n\n\u2022 seizures (fits) \n\n\u2022 low levels of blood platelets \n\n\u2022 thirst (dehydration) \n\n\u2022 abnormally heavy periods \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 wind (flatulence) \n\n\u2022 loss of appetite \n\n\u2022 mouth ulcer \n\n\u2022 muscle aches (pain), tenderness or \nweakness \n\n\u2022 fever \n\n\u2022 weight loss \n\n\u2022 laboratory test results: changes in blood \ntest results (such as blood chemistry and \n\nblood count) \n\n\u2022 confusion \n\n\u2022 difficulty paying attention \n\n\u2022 fainting \n\n\u2022 blurred vision \n\n\u2022 swelling of the hands and feet \n\n\u2022 high blood pressure \n\n\u2022 low blood pressure and feeling faint \nwhen getting up \n\n\u2022 coldness in the hands and feet \n\n\u2022 acne \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people  \n\n \n\n\u2022 heart attack \n\n\u2022 diabetes \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 kidney failure \n \n\n \n\nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 severe or life threatening skin reaction \nincluding blisters (Stevens Johnson \n\nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) \n\n \n\n\u2022 serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) \n\n\u2022 high levels of sugar in the blood \n \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you feel sick (nauseous), are vomiting, or have stomach pain, because these may \n\nbe signs of an inflamed pancreas. Also tell your doctor if you experience joint stiffness, aches and \n\npains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty moving, as this may be a sign of \n\nosteonecrosis. See also section 2 What you need to know before you or your child takes Ritonavir \n\nMylan.  \n\n \n\nIn patients with haemophilia type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking \n\nthis treatment or another protease inhibitor. Should this happen to you, seek immediate advice from \n\nyour doctor. \n\n \n\nAbnormal liver function tests, hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), and rarely jaundice, have been \n\nreported in patients taking ritonavir. Some people had other illnesses or were taking other medicines. \n\nPeople with liver disease or hepatitis may have worsening of liver disease. \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly when taking medicines \n\nto lower cholesterol in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors and \n\nnucleoside analogues. On rare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis). \n\nIn the event of unexplained or continual muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or cramps, stop taking the \n\nmedicine, contact your doctor as soon as possible or go to the Accident and Emergency Department of \n\nyour nearest hospital. \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nInform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any symptoms that suggest an allergic \n\nreaction after taking Ritonavir Mylan such as rash, hives or breathing difficulties. \n\n \n\nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\ncontact your doctor, pharmacist, Accident and Emergency department or if it is urgent get \n\nimmediate medical help. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

"always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. take this medicine one or two times a day every day with food. it is important that ritonavir mylan tablets are swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. recommended doses of ritonavir mylan are: if ritonavir mylan is used to boost the effects of certain other anti-hiv medicines the typical dose for adults is 1 to 2 tablets once or twice daily. for more detailed dose recommendations, including those for children, see the package leaflet of the anti-hiv medicines ritonavir mylan is given in combination with. if your doctor prescribes a full dose, adults may be started on a dose of 3 tablets in the morning and 3 tablets 12 hours later, gradually increasing over a period of up to 14 days to the full dose of 6 tablets twice daily (totalling 1,200 mg per day). children (2 - 12 years of age) will start with a dose smaller than this and continue up to the maximum allowed for their size. your doctor will advise you on the dosage to be taken. other forms of this medicine may be more appropriate for children who have difficulty swallowing tablets. ritonavir mylan should be taken every day to help control your hiv, no matter how much better you feel. if a side effect is preventing you from taking ritonavir mylan as directed, tell your doctor straight away. during episodes of diarrhoea your doctor may decide that extra monitoring is needed. always keep enough ritonavir mylan on hand so you don't run out. when you travel or need to stay in the hospital, make sure you have enough ritonavir mylan to last until you can get a new supply. if you take more ritonavir mylan than you should numbness, tingling, or a \"pins and needles\" sensation may occur if you take too much ritonavir. if you realise you have taken more ritonavir mylan than you were supposed to, contact your doctor or the accident and emergency department of your nearest hospital straight away. if you forget to take ritonavir mylan if you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible. if it is nearly time for the next dose, just take that one.

and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. also, the side effects of ritonavir when used with other antiretroviral medicines are dependent on the other medicines. so it is important that you carefully read the side effects section of the leaflets that are provided with these other medicines. very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people upper or lower stomach ache vomiting diarrhoea (may be severe) feeling sick (nausea) flushing, feeling hot headache dizziness pain in the throat cough upset stomach or indigestion a tingling sensation or numbness in the hands, feet or around the lips and mouth feeling weak/tired bad taste in the mouth damage to the nerves that can cause weakness and pain itching rash joint pain and back pain common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people 57 allergic reactions including skin rashes (may be red, raised, itchy), severe swelling of the skin and other tissues inability to sleep (insomnia) anxiety increase in cholesterol increase in triglycerides gout stomach bleeding inflammation of the liver and yellowing of skin or whites of the eyes increase in urination reduced kidney function seizures (fits) low

your doctor if you feel sick (nauseous), are vomiting, or have stomach pain, because these may be signs of an inflamed pancreas. also tell your doctor if you experience joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty moving, as this may be a sign of osteonecrosis. see also section 2 what you need to know before you or your child takes ritonavir mylan. in patients with haemophilia type a and b, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking this treatment or another protease inhibitor. should this happen to you, seek immediate advice from your doctor. abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), and rarely jaundice, have been reported in patients taking ritonavir. some people had other illnesses or were taking other medicines. people with liver disease or hepatitis may have worsening of liver disease. there have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly when taking medicines to lower cholesterol in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. on rare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis). in the event of unexplained or continual muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or cramps, stop taking the medicine, contact your doctor as soon as possible or go to the accident and emergency department of your nearest hospital. inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any symptoms that suggest an allergic reaction after taking ritonavir mylan such as rash, hives or breathing difficulties. if any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, contact your doctor, pharmacist, accident and emergency department or if it is urgent get immediate medical help. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can
