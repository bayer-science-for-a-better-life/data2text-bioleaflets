CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEcansya is indicated for the treatment of: \n \n- for the adjuvant treatment of patients following surgery of stage III (Dukes\u2019 stage C) colon \n\ncancer (see section 5.1). \n \n- metastatic colorectal cancer (see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n- first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer in combination with a platinum based regimen \n\n(see section 5.1). \n \n- in combination with docetaxel (see section 5.1) for the treatment of patients with locally \n\nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy \nshould have included an anthracycline. \n\n \n- as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer \n\nafter failure of taxanes and an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen or for whom \nfurther anthracycline therapy is not indicated. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCapecitabine should only be prescribed by a qualified physician experienced in the utilisation of \nanti-neoplastic medicinal products. Careful monitoring during the first cycle of treatment is \nrecommended for all patients. \nTreatment should be discontinued if progressive disease or intolerable toxicity is observed. Standard \nand reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for starting doses of Ecansya of \n1250 mg/m2 and 1000 mg/m2 are provided in tables 1 and 2, respectively. \n \nPosology \nRecommended posology (see section 5.1): \n \nMonotherapy \nColon, colorectal and breast cancer \nGiven as monotherapy, the recommended starting dose for capecitabine in the adjuvant treatment of \ncolon cancer, in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer or of locally advanced or metastatic \nbreast cancer is 1250 mg/m2 administered twice daily (morning and evening; equivalent to \n2500 mg/m2 total daily dose) for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. Adjuvant treatment in \npatients with stage III colon cancer is recommended for a total of 6 months. \n \nCombination therapy \nColon, colorectal and gastric cancer \nIn combination treatment, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine should be reduced to \n800 - 1000 mg/m2 when administered twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, or to \n625 mg/m2 twice daily when administered continuously (see section 5.1). For combination with \nirinotecan, the recommended starting dose is 800 mg/m2 when administered twice daily for 14 days \nfollowed by a 7-day rest period combined with irinotecan 200 mg/m2 on day 1. The inclusion of \nbevacizumab in a combination regimen has no effect on the starting dose of capecitabine. \nPremedication to maintain adequate hydration and anti-emesis according to the cisplatin summary of \nproduct characteristics should be started prior to cisplatin administration for patients receiving the \ncapecitabine plus cisplatin combination. Premedication with antiemetics according to the oxaliplatin \nsummary of product characteristics is recommended for patients receiving the capecitabine plus \noxaliplatin combination. Adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colon cancer is recommended \nfor a duration of 6 months. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn combination with docetaxel, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine in the treatment of \nmetastatic breast cancer is 1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, \ncombined with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Premedication \nwith an oral corticosteroid such as dexamethasone according to the docetaxel summary of product \ncharacteristics should be started prior to docetaxel administration for patients receiving the \ncapecitabine plus docetaxel combination. \n \nEcansya dose calculations \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 1  Standard and reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for a starting dose of \ncapecitabine of 1250 mg/m2 \n Dose level 1250 mg/m2 (twice daily) \n Full dose \n\n \n \n \n\n1250 mg/m2 \n\nNumber of 150 mg tablets, \n300 mg tablets and/or \n\n500 mg tablets per \nadministration (each \n\nadministration to be given \nmorning and evening) \n\nReduced dose \n(75%) \n\n \n \n\n950 mg/m2 \n\nReduced dose \n(50%) \n\n \n \n\n625 mg/m2 \n\nBody \nSurface \n\nArea (m2) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\n150 mg 300 mg 500 mg Dose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\u2264 1.26 1500 - - 3 1150 800 \n1.27 - 1.38 1650 1 - 3 1300 800 \n1.39 - 1.52 1800 - 1 3 1450 950 \n1.53 - 1.66 2000 - - 4 1500 1000 \n1.67 - 1.78 2150 1 - 4 1650 1000 \n1.79 - 1.92 2300 - 1 4 1800 1150 \n1.93 - 2.06 2500 - - 5 1950 1300 \n2.07 - 2.18 2650 1 - 5 2000 1300 \n\u2265 2.19 2800 - 1 5 2150 1450 \n\n \nTable 2  Standard and reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for a starting dose of \n\ncapecitabine of 1000 mg/m2 \n Dose level 1000 mg/m2 (twice daily) \n Full dose \n\n \n \n\n1000 mg/m2 \n\nNumber of 150 mg tablets, \n300 mg tablets and/or 500 mg \n\ntablets per administration \n(each administration to be \n\ngiven morning and evening) \n\nReduced dose \n(75%) \n\n \n750 mg/m2 \n\nReduced dose \n(50%) \n\n \n500 mg/m2 \n\nBody \nSurface \n\nArea (m2) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\n150 mg 300 mg 500 mg Dose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\u2264 1.26 1150 1 - 2 800 600 \n1.27 - 1.38 1300 - 1 2 1000 600 \n1.39 - 1.52 1450 1 1 2 1100 750 \n1.53 - 1.66 1600 - 2 2 1200 800 \n1.67 - 1.78 1750 1 2 2 1300 800 \n1.79 - 1.92 1800 - 1 3 1400 900 \n1.93 - 2.06 2000 - - 4 1500 1000 \n2.07 - 2.18 2150 1 - 4 1600 1050 \n\u2265 2.19 2300 - 1 4 1750 1100 \n\n \nPosology adjustments during treatment \nGeneral \nToxicity due to capecitabine administration may be managed by symptomatic treatment and/or \nmodification of the dose (treatment interruption or dose reduction). Once the dose has been reduced, it \nshould not be increased at a later time. For those toxicities considered by the treating physician to be \nunlikely to become serious or life-threatening, e.g. alopecia, altered taste, nail changes, treatment can \nbe continued at the same dose without reduction or interruption. Patients taking capecitabine should be \ninformed of the need to interrupt treatment immediately if moderate or severe toxicity occurs. Doses \nof capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced. The following are the recommended dose \nmodifications for toxicity. \n \nTable 3  Capecitabine dose reduction schedule (3 weekly cycle or continuous treatment) \n\n\n\n5 \n\nToxicity grades* Dose changes within a treatment cycle Dose adjustment for next \ncycle/dose \n\n(% of starting dose) \n\u2022    Grade 1 Maintain dose level Maintain dose level \n\u2022    Grade 2 \n-1st appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0-1 \n\n \n100% \n\n-2nd appearance 75% \n-3rd appearance 50% \n-4th appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Not applicable \n\u2022    Grade 3 \n-1st appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0-1 75% \n-2nd appearance 50% \n-3rd appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Not applicable \n\u2022    Grade 4 \n-1st appearance Discontinue permanently \n\nor \nIf physician deems it to be in the \npatient's best interest to continue, \ninterrupt until resolved to grade 0-1 \n\n50% \n\n-2nd appearance Discontinue permanently Not applicable \n*According to the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trial Group (NCIC CTG) Common \nToxicity Criteria (version 1) or the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of \nthe Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, US National Cancer Institute, version 4.0. For hand-foot \nsyndrome and hyperbilirubinemia, see section 4.4. \n \nHaematology \nPatients with baseline neutrophil counts of <1.5 x 109/L and/or thrombocyte counts of <100 x 109/L \nshould not be treated with capecitabine. If unscheduled laboratory assessments during a treatment \ncycle show that the neutrophil count drops below 1.0 x 109/L or that the platelet count drops below \n75 x 109/L, treatment with capecitabine should be interrupted. \n \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3 weekly cycle in combination with \nother medicinal products \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3 weekly cycle in combination with \nother medicinal products should be made according to table 3 above for capecitabine and according to \nthe appropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). \n \nAt the beginning of a treatment cycle, if a treatment delay is indicated for either capecitabine or the \nother medicinal product(s), then administration of all therapy should be delayed until the requirements \nfor restarting all medicinal products are met. \n \nDuring a treatment cycle for those toxicities considered by the treating physician not to be related to \ncapecitabine, capecitabine should be continued and the dose of the other medicinal product should be \nadjusted according to the appropriate Prescribing Information. \n \nIf the other medicinal product(s) have to be discontinued permanently, capecitabine treatment can be \nresumed when the requirements for restarting capecitabine are met. \n \nThis advice is applicable to all indications and to all special populations. \n \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other \nmedicinal products \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other \nmedicinal products should be made according to table 3 above for capecitabine and according to the \nappropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPosology adjustments for special populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nInsufficient safety and efficacy data are available in patients with hepatic impairment to provide a dose \nadjustment recommendation. No information is available on hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis or \nhepatitis. \n \nRenal impairment \nCapecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below \n30 ml/min [Cockcroft and Gault] at baseline). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in \npatients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min at baseline) is increased \ncompared to the overall population. In patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline, a dose \nreduction to 75% for a starting dose of 1250 mg/m2 is recommended. In patients with moderate renal \nimpairment at baseline, no dose reduction is required for a starting dose of 1000 mg/m2. In patients \nwith mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51-80 ml/min at baseline) no adjustment of the \nstarting dose is recommended. Careful monitoring and prompt treatment interruption is recommended \nif the patient develops a grade 2, 3 or 4 adverse event during treatment and subsequent dose \nadjustment as outlined in table 3 above. If the calculated creatinine clearance decreases during \ntreatment to a value below 30 ml/min, Ecansya should be discontinued. These dose adjustment \nrecommendations for renal impairment apply both to monotherapy and combination use (see also \nsection \"Elderly\" below). \n \nElderly \nDuring capecitabine monotherapy, no adjustment of the starting dose is needed. However, grade 3 or 4 \ntreatment-related adverse reactions were more frequent in patients \u226560 years of age compared to \nyounger patients. \nWhen capecitabine was used in combination with other medicinal products, elderly patients (\u226565 \nyears) experienced more grade 3 and grade 4 adverse drug reactions, including those leading to \ndiscontinuation, compared to younger patients. Careful monitoring of patients \u226560 years of age is \nadvisable. \n- In combination with docetaxel: an increased incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse \n\nreactions and treatment-related serious adverse reactions were observed in patients 60 years of \nage or more (see section 5.1). For patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75% (950 mg/m2 twice daily) is recommended. If no toxicity is observed in \npatients \u226560 years of age treated with a reduced capecitabine starting dose in combination with \ndocetaxel, the dose of capecitabine may be cautiously escalated to 1250 mg/m2 twice daily. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of capecitabine in the paediatric population in the indications colon, \ncolorectal, gastric and breast cancer. \n \nMethod of administration \nEcansya tablets should be swallowed whole with water within 30 minutes after a meal. \nEcansya tablets should not be crushed or cut. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- History of severe and unexpected reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy, \n- Hypersensitivity to capecitabine or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or fluorouracil, \n- Known complete dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (see section 4.4), \n- During pregnancy and lactation, \n- In patients with severe leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia, \n- In patients with severe hepatic impairment, \n- In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min), \n- Recent or concomitant treatment with brivudine (see section 4.4 and 4.5 for drug-drug \n\ninteraction), \n- If contraindications exist to any of the medicinal products in the combination regimen, that \n\n\n\n7 \n\nmedicinal product should not be used. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDose limiting toxicities  \nDose limiting toxicities include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome \n(hand-foot skin reaction, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). Most adverse reactions are reversible and \ndo not require permanent discontinuation of therapy, although doses may need to be withheld or \nreduced. \n \nDiarrhoea. Patients with severe diarrhoea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and \nelectrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. Standard antidiarrhoeal treatments (e.g. \nloperamide) may be used. NCIC CTC grade 2 diarrhoea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day \nor nocturnal stools, grade 3 diarrhoea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and \nmalabsorption. Grade 4 diarrhoea is an increase of \u226510 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhoea or the \nneed for parenteral support. Dose reduction should be applied as necessary (see section 4.2). \n \nDehydration. Dehydration should be prevented or corrected at the onset. Patients with anorexia, \nasthenia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea may rapidly become dehydrated. Dehydration may cause acute \nrenal failure, especially in patients with pre-existing compromised renal function or when capecitabine \nis given concomitantly with known nephrotoxic medicinal products. Acute renal failure secondary to \ndehydration might be potentially fatal. If grade 2 (or higher) dehydration occurs, capecitabine \ntreatment should be immediately interrupted and the dehydration corrected. Treatment should not be \nrestarted until the patient is rehydrated and any precipitating causes have been corrected or controlled. \nDose modifications applied should be applied for the precipitating adverse event as necessary (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHand-foot syndrome (also known as hand-foot skin reaction or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or \nchemotherapy induced acral erythema). Grade 1 hand-foot syndrome is defined as numbness, \ndysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless swelling or erythema of the hands and/or feet and/or \ndiscomfort which does not disrupt the patient\u2019s normal activities. \nGrade 2 hand-foot syndrome is painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or \ndiscomfort affecting the patient\u2019s activities of daily living. \nGrade 3 hand-foot syndrome is moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the hands \nand/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities \nof daily living. Persistent or severe hand-foot syndrome (Grade 2 and above) can eventually lead to \nloss of fingerprints which could impact patient identification. If grade 2 or 3 hand-foot syndrome \noccurs, administration of capecitabine should be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in \nintensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should \nbe decreased. When capecitabine and cisplatin are used in combination, the use of vitamin B6 \n(pyridoxine) is not advised for symptomatic or secondary prophylactic treatment of hand-foot \nsyndrome, because of published reports that it may decrease the efficacy of cisplatin. There is some \nevidence that dexpanthenol is effective for hand-foot syndrome prophylaxis in patients treated with \nEcansya. \n \nCardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity has been associated with fluoropyrimidine therapy, including \nmyocardial infarction, angina, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, sudden death and \nelectrocardiographic changes (including very rare cases of QT prolongation). These adverse reactions \nmay be more common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrhythmias \n(including ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes, and bradycardia), angina pectoris, myocardial \ninfarction, heart failure and cardiomyopathy have been reported in patients receiving capecitabine. \nCaution must be exercised in patients with history of significant cardiac disease, arrhythmias and \nangina pectoris (see section 4.8). \n \nHypo- or hypercalcaemia. Hypo- or hypercalcaemia has been reported during capecitabine treatment. \nCaution must be exercised in patients with pre-existing hypo- or hypercalcaemia (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nCentral or peripheral nervous system disease. Caution must be exercised in patients with central or \nperipheral nervous system disease, e.g. brain metastasis or neuropathy (see section 4.8). \n \nDiabetes mellitus or electrolyte disturbances. Caution must be exercised in patients with diabetes \nmellitus or electrolyte disturbances, as these may be aggravated during capecitabine treatment. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulation. In an interaction study with single-dose warfarin administration, \nthere was a significant increase in the mean AUC (+57%) of S-warfarin. These results suggest an \ninteraction, probably due to an inhibition of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system by \ncapecitabine. Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant \ntherapy should have their anticoagulant response (INR or prothrombin time) monitored closely and the \nanticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see section 4.5). \n \nBrivudine. Brivudine must not be administered concomitantly with capecitabine. Fatal cases have been \nreported following this drug interaction. There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between end \nof treatment with brivudine and start of capecitabine therapy. Treatment with brivudine can be started \n24 hours after the last dose of capecitabine (see section 4.3 and 4.5). In the event of accidental \nadministration of brivudine to patients being treated with capecitabine, effective measures should be \ntaken to reduce the toxicity of capecitabine. Immediate admission to hospital is recommended. All \nmeasures should be initiated to prevent systemic infections and dehydration. \n \nHepatic impairment. In the absence of safety and efficacy data in patients with hepatic impairment, \ncapecitabine use should be carefully monitored in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction, \nregardless of the presence or absence of liver metastasis. Administration of capecitabine should be \ninterrupted if treatment-related elevations in bilirubin of >3.0 x ULN or treatment-related elevations in \nhepatic aminotransferases (ALT, AST) of >2.5 x ULN occur. Treatment with capecitabine \nmonotherapy may be resumed when bilirubin decreases to \u22643.0 x ULN or hepatic aminotransferases \ndecrease to \u2264 2.5 x ULN. \n \nRenal impairment. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min) is increased compared to the overall population (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nDihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency:  \nDPD activity is rate limiting in the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil (see Section 5.2). Patients with DPD \ndeficiency are therefore at increased risk of fluoropyrimidines-related toxicity, including for example \nstomatitis, diarrhoea, mucosal inflammation, neutropenia and neurotoxicity. \n \nDPD-deficiency related toxicity usually occurs during the first cycle of treatment or after dose \nincrease. \n \nComplete DPD deficiency \nComplete DPD deficiency is rare (0.01-0.5% of Caucasians). Patients with complete DPD deficiency \nare at high risk of life-threatening or fatal toxicity and must not be treated with Ecansya (see section \n4.3).  \n \nPartial DPD deficiency \nPartial DPD deficiency is estimated to affect 3-9% of the Caucasian population. Patients with partial \nDPD deficiency are at increased risk of severe and potentially life-threatening toxicity. A reduced \nstarting dose should be considered to limit this toxicity. DPD deficiency should be considered as a \nparameter to be taken into account in conjunction with other routine measures for dose reduction. \nInitial dose reduction may impact the efficacy of treatment. In the absence of serious toxicity, \nsubsequent doses may be increased with careful monitoring.  \n \nTesting for DPD deficiency \nPhenotype and/or genotype testing prior to the initiation of treatment with Ecansya is recommended \ndespite uncertainties regarding optimal pre-treatment testing methodologies. Consideration should be \n\n\n\n9 \n\ngiven to applicable clinical guidelines.  \n \nGenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency  \nPre-treatment testing for rare mutations of the DPYD gene can identify patients with DPD deficiency. \n \nThe four DPYD variants c.1905+1G>A [also known as DPYD*2A], c.1679T>G [DPYD*13], \nc.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3 can cause complete absence or reduction of DPD enzymatic \nactivity. Other rare variants may also be associated with an increased risk of severe or life-threatening \ntoxicity.  \n \nCertain homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the DPYD gene locus (e.g. \ncombinations of the four variants with at least one allele of c.1905+1G>A or c.1679T>G) are known \nto cause complete or near complete absence of DPD enzymatic activity. \n \nPatients with certain heterozygous DPYD variants (including c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T \nand c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants) have increased risk of severe toxicity when treated with \nfluoropyrimidines.  \n \nThe frequency of the heterozygous c.1905+1G>A genotype in the DPYD gene in Caucasian patients is \naround 1%, 1.1% for c.2846A>T, 2.6-6.3% for c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants and 0.07 to 0.1% for \nc.1679T>G.  \n \nData on the frequency of the four DPYD variants in other populations than Caucasian is limited. At \nthe present, the four DPYD variants (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3) \nare considered virtually absent in populations of African (-American) or Asian origin.  \n \nPhenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency \nFor phenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency, the measurement of pre-therapeutic blood levels \nof the endogenous DPD substrate uracil (U) in plasma is recommended. \n \nElevated pre-treatment uracil concentrations are associated with an increased risk of toxicity. Despite \nuncertainties on uracil thresholds defining complete and partial DPD deficiency, a blood uracil level \u2265 \n16 ng/ml and < 150 ng/ml should be considered indicative of partial DPD deficiency and associated \nwith an increased risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity. A blood uracil level \u2265 150 ng/ml should be \nconsidered indicative of complete DPD deficiency and associated with a risk for life-threatening or \nfatal fluoropyrimidine toxicity. \n \nOphthalmologic complications: Patients should be carefully monitored for ophthalmological \ncomplications such as keratitis and corneal disorders, especially if they have a prior history of eye \ndisorders. Treatment of eye disorders should be initiated as clinically appropriate. \n \nSevere skin reactions: Ecansya can induce severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome \nand Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. Ecansya should be permanently discontinued in patients who \nexperience a severe skin reaction during treatment. \n \nAs this medicinal product contains anhydrous lactose as an excipient, patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should \nnot take this medicine. \n \nEcansya tablets should not be crushed or cut. In case of exposure of either patient or caregiver to \ncrushed or cut Ecansya tablets adverse drug reactions could occur (see Section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nBrivudine: a clinically significant interaction between brivudine and fluoropyrimidines (e.g. \ncapecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, tegafur), resulting from the inhibition of dihydropyrimidine \ndehydrogenase by brivudine, has been described. This interaction, which leads to increased \nfluoropyrimidine toxicity, is potentially fatal. Therefore, brivudine must not be administered \nconcomitantly with  capecitabine (see section 4.3 and 4.4). There must be at least a 4-week waiting \nperiod between end of treatment with brivudine and start of capecitabine therapy. Treatment with \nbrivudine can be started 24 hours after the last dose of capecitabine. \n \nCytochrome P-450 2C9 substrates: Other than warfarin, no formal interaction studies between \ncapecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates have been conducted. Care should be exercised when \ncapecitabine is co-administered with 2C9 substrates (e.g., phenytoin). See also interaction with \ncoumarin-derivative anticoagulants below, and section 4.4. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulants: altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been \nreported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such \nas warfarin and phenprocoumon. These reactions occurred within several days and up to several \nmonths after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within one month after stopping \ncapecitabine. In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study, after a single 20 mg dose of warfarin, \ncapecitabine treatment increased the AUC of S-warfarin by 57% with a 91% increase in INR value. \nSince metabolism of R-warfarin was not affected, these results indicate that capecitabine down-\nregulates isozyme 2C9, but has no effect on isozymes 1A2 and 3A4. Patients taking coumarin-\nderivative anticoagulants concomitantly with capecitabine should be monitored regularly for \nalterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR) and the anticoagulant dose adjusted \naccordingly. \n \nPhenytoin: increased phenytoin plasma concentrations resulting in symptoms of phenytoin \nintoxication in single cases have been reported during concomitant use of capecitabine with phenytoin. \nPatients taking phenytoin concomitantly with capecitabine should be regularly monitored for increased \nphenytoin plasma concentrations. \n \nFolinic acid/folic acid: a combination study with capecitabine and folinic acid indicated that folinic \nacid has no major effect on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites. However, folinic \nacid has an effect on the pharmacodynamics of capecitabine and its toxicity may be enhanced by \nfolinic acid: the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen \nis 3000 mg/m2 per day whereas it is only 2000 mg/m2 per day when capecitabine was combined with \nfolinic acid (30 mg orally bid). The enhanced toxicity may be relevant when switching from 5-FU/LV \nto a capecitabine regimen. This may also be relevant with folic acid supplementation for folate \ndeficiency due to the similarity between folinic acid and folic acid. \n \nAntacid: the effect of an aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacid on the \npharmacokinetics of capecitabine was investigated. There was a small increase in plasma \nconcentrations of capecitabine and one metabolite (5\u2019-DFCR); there was no effect on the 3 major \nmetabolites (5\u2019-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL). \n \nAllopurinol: interactions with allopurinol have been observed for 5-FU; with possible decreased \nefficacy of 5-FU. Concomitant use of allopurinol with capecitabine should be avoided. \n \nInterferon alpha: the MTD of capecitabine was 2000 mg/m2 per day when combined with interferon \nalpha-2a (3 MIU/m2 per day) compared to 3000 mg/m2 per day when capecitabine was used alone. \n \nRadiotherapy: the MTD of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen is 3000 mg/m2 per day, \nwhereas, when combined with radiotherapy for rectal cancer, the MTD of capecitabine is 2000 mg/m2 \nper day using either a continuous schedule or given daily Monday through Friday during a 6-week \ncourse of radiotherapy. \n \nOxaliplatin: no clinically significant differences in exposure to capecitabine or its metabolites, free \n\n\n\n11 \n\nplatinum or total platinum occurred when capecitabine was administered in combination with \noxaliplatin or in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. \n \nBevacizumab: there was no clinically significant effect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetic \nparameters of capecitabine or its metabolites in the presence of oxaliplatin. \n \nFood interaction \nIn all clinical trials, patients were instructed to administer capecitabine within 30 minutes after a meal. \nSince current safety and efficacy data are based upon administration with food, it is recommended that \ncapecitabine be administered with food. Administration with food decreases the rate of capecitabine \nabsorption (see section 5.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \ntreatment with capecitabine. If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving capecitabine, the \npotential hazard to the foetus must be explained. An effective method of contraception should be used \nduring treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of capecitabine. \nBased on genetic toxicity findings, male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should \nuse effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of capecitabine. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no studies in pregnant women using capecitabine; however, it should be assumed that \ncapecitabine may cause foetal harm if administered to pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity \nstudies in animals, capecitabine administration caused embryolethality and teratogenicity. These \nfindings are expected effects of fluoropyrimidine derivatives. Capecitabine is contraindicated during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether capecitabine is excreted in human breast milk. No studies have been \nconducted to assess the impact of capecitabine on milk production or its presence in human breast \nmilk. In lactating mice, considerable amounts of capecitabine and its metabolites were found in milk.  \nAs the potential for harm to the nursing infant is unknown, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with capecitabine and for 2 weeks after the final dose. \n \nFertility \nThere is no data on Ecansya and impact on fertility. The Ecansya pivotal studies included females of \nchildbearing potential and males only if they agreed to use an acceptable method of birth control to \navoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and for a reasonable period thereafter. \nIn animal studies effects on fertility were observed (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEcansya has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Capecitabine may \ncause dizziness, fatigue and nausea. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of capecitabine is based on data from over 3000 patients treated with \ncapecitabine as monotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in \nmultiple indications. The safety profiles of capecitabine monotherapy for the metastatic breast cancer, \nmetastatic colorectal cancer and adjuvant colon cancer populations are comparable. See section 5.1 for \ndetails of major studies, including study designs and major efficacy results. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nThe most commonly reported and/or clinically relevant treatment-related adverse drug reactions \n(ADRs) were gastrointestinal disorders (especially diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, \nstomatitis), hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), fatigue, asthenia, anorexia, \ncardiotoxicity, increased renal dysfunction on those with preexisting compromised renal function, and \nthrombosis/embolism. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nADRs considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or remotely related to the \nadministration of capecitabine are listed in table 4 for capecitabine given as monotherapy and in table \n5 for capecitabine given in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple indications. \nThe following headings are used to rank the ADRs by frequency: very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nCapecitabine Monotherapy \nTable 4 lists ADRs associated with the use of capecitabine monotherapy based on a pooled analysis of \nsafety data from three major studies including over 1900 patients (studies M66001, SO14695, and \nSO14796).

ADRs are added according to the highest incidence seen in any \nof the major combination trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHand-foot syndrome (see section 4.4): \nFor the capecitabine dose of 1250 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks, a frequency of \n53% to 60% of all-grades HFS was observed in capecitabine monotherapy trials (comprising studies in \nadjuvant therapy in colon cancer, treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and treatment of breast \ncancer) and a frequency of 63% was observed in the capecitabine/docetaxel arm for the treatment of \nmetastatic breast cancer. For the capecitabine dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 3 \nweeks, a frequency of 22% to 30% of all-grade HFS was observed in capecitabine combination \ntherapy. \n \nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with capecitabine \nmonotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer) showed that HFS (all grades) occurred in \n2066 (43%) patients after a median time of 239 [95% CI 201, 288] days after starting treatment with \ncapecitabine. In all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically significantly \nassociated with an increased risk of developing HFS: increasing capecitabine starting dose (gram), \ndecreasing cumulative capecitabine dose (0.1*kg), increasing relative dose intensity in the first six \nweeks, increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year increments), female \ngender, and good ECOG performance status at baseline (0 versus \u22651). \n \nDiarrhoea (see section 4.4): \nCapecitabine can induce the occurrence of diarrhoea, which has been observed in up to 50% of \npatients. \n \nThe results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with \ncapecitabine showed that in all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically \nsignificantly associated with an increased risk of developing diarrhoea: increasing capecitabine \nstarting dose (gram), increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year \nincrements), and female gender. The following covariates were statistically significantly associated \nwith a decreased risk of developing diarrhoea: increasing cumulative capecitabine dose (0.1*kg) and \nincreasing relative dose intensity in the first six weeks. \n \nCardiotoxicity (see section 4.4): \nIn addition to the ADRs described in tables 4 and 5, the following ADRs with an incidence of less than \n0.1% were associated with the use of capecitabine monotherapy based on a pooled analysis from \n\n\n\n17 \n\nclinical safety data from 7 clinical trials including 949 patients (2 phase III and 5 phase II clinical trials \nin metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic breast cancer): cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, sudden \ndeath, and ventricular extrasystoles. \n \nEncephalopathy: \nIn addition to the ADRs described in tables 4 and 5, and based on the above pooled analysis from \nclinical safety data from 7 clinical trials, encephalopathy was also associated with the use of \ncapecitabine monotherapy with an incidence of less than 0.1%. \n \nExposure to crushed or cut capecitabine tablets: \nIn the instance of exposure to crushed or cut capecitabine tablets, the following adverse drug reactions \nhave been reported: eye irritation, eye swelling, skin rash, headache, paresthesia, diarrhea, nausea, \ngastric irritation, and vomiting. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (see section 4.2): \nAn analysis of safety data in patients \u2265 60 years of age treated with capecitabine monotherapy and an \nanalysis of patients treated with capecitabine plus docetaxel combination therapy showed an increase \nin the incidence of treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions and treatment-related serious \nadverse reactions compared to patients < 60 years of age. Patients \u2265 60 years of age treated with \ncapecitabine plus docetaxel also had more early withdrawals from treatment due to adverse reactions \ncompared to patients < 60 years of age. \n \nThe results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with \ncapecitabine showed that in all studies combined, increasing age (by 10 year increments) was \nstatistically significantly associated with an increased risk of developing HFS and diarrhoea and with a \ndecreased risk of developing neutropenia. \n \nGender \nThe results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with \ncapecitabine showed that in all studies combined, female gender was statistically significantly \nassociated with an increased risk of developing HFS and diarrhoea and with a decreased risk of \ndeveloping neutropenia. \n \nRenal impairment (see section 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2): \nAn analysis of safety data in patients treated with capecitabine monotherapy (colorectal cancer) with \nbaseline renal impairment showed an increase in the incidence of treatment-related grade 3 and 4 \nadverse reactions compared to patients with normal renal function (36% in patients without renal \nimpairment n=268, vs. 41% in mild n=257 and 54% in moderate n=59, respectively) (see section 5.2). \nPatients with moderately impaired renal function show an increased rate of dose reduction (44%) vs. \n33% and 32% in patients with no or mild renal impairment and an increase in early withdrawals from \ntreatment (21% withdrawals during the first two cycles) vs. 5% and 8% in patients with no or mild \nrenal impairment. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nThe manifestations of acute overdose include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, gastrointestinal \nirritation and bleeding, and bone marrow depression.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18 \n\nManagement \nMedical management of overdose should include customary therapeutic and supportive medical \ninterventions aimed at correcting the presenting clinical manifestations and preventing their possible \ncomplications. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, ATC code: L01BC06. \n \nCapecitabine is a non-cytotoxic fluoropyrimidine carbamate, which functions as an orally \nadministered precursor of the cytotoxic moiety 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Capecitabine is activated via \nseveral enzymatic steps (see section 5.2). The enzyme involved in the final conversion to 5-FU, \nthymidine phosphorylase (ThyPase), is found in tumour tissues, but also in normal tissues, albeit \nusually at lower levels. In human cancer xenograft models capecitabine demonstrated a synergistic \neffect in combination with docetaxel, which may be related to the upregulation of thymidine \nphosphorylase by docetaxel. \n \nThere is evidence that the metabolism of 5-FU in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation \nreaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thereby interfering with the synthesis of \ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The incorporation of 5-FU also leads to inhibition of RNA and protein \nsynthesis. Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth, the effect of 5-FU may be \nto create a thymidine deficiency that provokes unbalanced growth and death of a cell. The effects of \nDNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells which proliferate more rapidly and which \nmetabolise 5-FU at a more rapid rate. \n \nColon and colorectal cancer: \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine in adjuvant colon cancer \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial in patients with stage III \n(Dukes\u2019 C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the adjuvant treatment of patients with \ncolon cancer (XACT Study; M66001). In this trial, 1987 patients were randomised to treatment with \ncapecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as 3-\nweek cycles for 24 weeks) or 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo Clinic regimen: 20 mg/m2 leucovorin  \nintravenous followed by 425 mg/m2 intravenous bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days for 24 \nweeks). Capecitabine was at least equivalent to intravenous 5-FU/LV in disease-free survival in per \nprotocol population (hazard ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.80-1.06). In the all-randomised population, tests for \ndifference of capecitabine vs 5-FU/LV in disease-free and overall survival showed hazard ratios of \n0.88 (95% CI 0.77 \u2013 1.01; p = 0.068) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 \u2013 1.01; p = 0.060), respectively. The \nmedian follow up at the time of the analysis was 6.9 years. In a preplanned multivariate Cox analysis, \nsuperiority of capecitabine compared with bolus 5-FU/LV was demonstrated. The following factors \nwere pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan for inclusion in the model: age, time from surgery to \nrandomization, gender, CEA levels at baseline, lymph nodes at baseline, and country. In the all-\nrandomised population, capecitabine was shown to be superior to 5FU/LV for disease-free survival \n(hazard ratio 0.849; 95% CI 0.739 - 0.976; p = 0.0212), as well as for overall survival (hazard ratio \n0.828; 95% CI 0.705 - 0.971; p = 0.0203). \n \nCombination therapy in adjuvant colon cancer \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 3 clinical trial in patients with stage III \n(Dukes\u2019 C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin (XELOX) \nfor the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer (NO16968 study). In this trial, 944 patients \nwere randomised to 3-week cycles for 24 weeks with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 \nweeks followed by a 1-week rest period) in combination with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 intravenous \ninfusion over 2-hours on day 1 every 3 weeks); 942 patients were randomised to bolus 5-FU and \nleucovorin. In the primary analysis for DFS in the ITT population, XELOX was shown to be \n\n\n\n19 \n\nsignificantly superior to 5-FU/LV (HR=0.80, 95% CI=[0.69; 0.93]; p=0.0045). The 3 year DFS rate \nwas 71% for XELOX versus 67% for 5-FU/LV. The analysis for the secondary endpoint of RFS \nsupports these results with a HR of 0.78 (95% CI=[0.67; 0.92]; p=0.0024) for XELOX vs. 5-FU/LV. \nXELOX showed a trend towards superior OS with a HR of 0.87 (95% CI=[0.72; 1.05]; p=0.1486) \nwhich translates into a 13% reduction in risk of death. The 5 year OS rate was 78% for XELOX versus \n74% for 5-FU/LV. The efficacy data is based on a median observation time of 59 months for OS and \n57 months for DFS. The rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher in the XELOX \ncombination therapy arm (21%) as compared with that of the 5-FU/LV monotherapy arm (9%) in the \nITT population. \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine in metastatic colorectal cancer \nData from two identically-designed, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trials \n(SO14695; SO14796) support the use of capecitabine for first line treatment of metastatic colorectal \ncancer. In these trials, 603 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice \ndaily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as 3-week cycles). 604 patients were \nrandomised to treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo regimen: 20 mg/m2 leucovorin  intravenous \nfollowed by 425 mg/m2  intravenous bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days). The overall objective \nresponse rates in the all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were 25.7% (capecitabine) \nvs. 16.7% (Mayo regimen); p <0.0002. The median time to progression was 140 days (capecitabine) \nvs. 144 days (Mayo regimen). Median survival was 392 days (capecitabine) vs. 391 days (Mayo \nregimen). Currently, no comparative data are available on capecitabine monotherapy in colorectal \ncancer in comparison with first line combination regimens. \n \nCombination therapy in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer \nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study (NO16966) support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin or in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab for \nthe first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The study contained two parts: an initial 2-arm \npart in which 634 patients were randomised to two different treatment groups, including XELOX or \nFOLFOX-4, and a subsequent 2x2 factorial part in which 1401 patients were randomised to four \ndifferent treatment groups, including XELOX plus placebo, FOLFOX-4 plus placebo, XELOX plus \nbevacizumab, and FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab. See table 6 for treatment regimens. \n \nTable 6 Treatment regimens in study NO16966 (mCRC)  \n\n Treatment Starting Dose Schedule \nFOLFOX-4 \n\nor \nFOLFOX-4 + \nBevacizumab \n\nOxaliplatin 85 mg/m2  \nintravenous 2 hr \n \n\nOxaliplatin on Day 1, every 2 weeks \nLeucovorin on Days 1 and 2, every 2 \nweeks \n5-fluorouracil  intravenous \nbolus/infusion, each on Days 1 and 2, \nevery 2 weeks \n\nLeucovorin 200 mg/m2  \nintravenous 2 hr \n \n\n5-Fluorouracil 400 mg/m2  \nintravenous bolus, \nfollowed by 600 mg/ \nm2  intravenous 22 hr \n\nPlacebo or \nBevacizumab \n\n5 mg/kg  intravenous \n30-90 mins \n\nDay 1, prior to FOLFOX-4, every \n2 weeks \n\nXELOX \nor \n\nXELOX+ \nBevacizumab \n\nOxaliplatin 130 mg/m2  \nintravenous 2 hr \n \n\nOxaliplatin on Day 1, every 3 weeks \nCapecitabine oral twice daily for 2 \nweeks (followed by 1 week off- \ntreatment) Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 oral \n\ntwice daily \nPlacebo or \nBevacizumab \n\n7.5 mg/kg  \nintravenous 30-90 \nmins \n\nDay 1, prior to XELOX, every 3 weeks \n\n5-Fluorouracil:   intravenous bolus injection immediately after leucovorin \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nNon-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the FOLFOX-4-containing arms in the \noverall comparison was demonstrated in terms of progression-free survival in the eligible patient \npopulation and the intent-to-treat population (see table 7). The results indicate that XELOX is \nequivalent to FOLFOX-4 in terms of overall survival (see table 7). A comparison of XELOX plus \nbevacizumab versus FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab was a pre-specified exploratory analysis. In this \ntreatment subgroup comparison, XELOX plus bevacizumab was similar compared to FOLFOX-4 plus \nbevacizumab in terms of progression-free survival (hazard ratio 1.01; 97.5% CI 0.84 - 1.22). The \nmedian follow up at the time of the primary analyses in the intent-to-treat population was 1.5 years; \ndata from analyses following an additional 1 year of follow up are also included in table 7. However, \nthe on-treatment PFS analysis did not confirm the results of the general PFS and OS analysis: the \nhazard ratio of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 was 1.24 with 97.5% CI 1.07 - 1.44. Although sensitivity \nanalyses show that differences in regimen schedules and timing of tumor assessments impact the \non-treatment PFS analysis, a full explanation for this result has not been found. \n \nTable 7 Key efficacy results for the non-inferiority analysis of Study NO16966  \n\nPRIMARY ANALYSIS \n\n \n\nXELOX/XELOX+P/ \nXELOX+BV \n\n(EPP*: N=967; ITT**: \nN=1017) \n\nFOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P/ \nFOLFOX-4+BV \n\n(EPP*: N=937; ITT**: \nN=1017)  \n\nPopulation Median Time to Event (Days)  \nHR \n\n(97.5% CI) \nParameter: Progression-free Survival \n\nEPP \nITT \n\n241 \n244 \n\n259 \n259 \n\n1.05 (0.94; 1.18) \n1.04 (0.93; 1.16) \n\nParameter: Overall Survival \nEPP \nITT \n\n577 \n581 \n\n549 \n553 \n\n0.97 (0.84; 1.14) \n0.96 (0.83; 1.12) \n\nADDITIONAL 1 YEAR OF FOLLOW UP \n\nPopulation Median Time to Event (Days)  \nHR \n\n(97.5% CI) \nParameter: Progression-free Survival \n\nEPP \nITT \n\n242 \n244 \n\n259 \n259 \n\n1.02 (0.92; 1.14) \n1.01 (0.91; 1.12) \n\nParameter: Overall Survival \nEPP \nITT \n\n600 \n602 \n\n594 \n596 \n\n1.00 (0.88; 1.13) \n0.99 (0.88; 1.12) \n\n*EPP=eligible patient population; **ITT=intent-to-treat population \n \nIn a randomised, controlled phase III study (CAIRO), the effect of using capecitabine at a starting dose \nof 1000 mg/m2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan for the first-line treatment of \npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer was studied. 820 patients were randomised to receive either \nsequential treatment (n=410) or combination treatment (n=410). Sequential treatment consisted of \nfirst-line capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days), second-line irinotecan (350 mg/m2 on day \n1), and third-line combination of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days) with oxaliplatin \n(130 mg/m2 on day 1). Combination treatment consisted of first-line capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice \ndaily for 14 days) combined with irinotecan (250 mg /m2 on day 1) (XELIRI) and second-line \ncapecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days) plus oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 on day 1). All \ntreatment cycles were administered at intervals of 3 weeks. In first-line treatment the median \nprogression-free survival in the intent-to-treat population was 5.8 months (95%CI 5.1 - 6.2 months) \nfor capecitabine monotherapy and 7.8 months (95%CI 7.0 - 8.3 months; p=0.0002) for XELIRI. \nHowever this was associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and neutropenia \nduring first-line treatment with XELIRI (26% and 11% for XELIRI and first line capecitabine \nrespectively). \n \nThe XELIRI has been compared with 5-FU + irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in three randomised studies in \n\n\n\n21 \n\npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The XELIRI regimens included capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 \ntwice daily on days 1 to 14 of a three-week cycle combined with irinotecan 250 mg/m2 on day1. In the \nlargest study (BICC-C), patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n=144), \nbolus 5-FU (mIFL) (n=145) or XELIRI (n=141) and were additionally randomised to receive either \ndouble-blind treatment with celecoxib or placebo. Median PFS was 7.6 months for FOLFIRI, 5.9 \nmonths for mIFL (p=0.004) for the comparison with FOLFIRI), and 5.8 months for XELIRI \n(p=0.015). Median OS was 23.1 months for FOLFIRI, 17.6 months for mIFL (p=0.09), and 18.9 \nmonths for XELIRI (p=0.27). Patients treated with XELIRI experienced excessive gastrointestinal \ntoxicity compared with FOLFIRI (diarrhoea 48% and 14% for XELIRI and FOLFIRI respectively). \n \nIn the EORTC study patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n=41) or \nXELIRI (n=44) with additional randomisation to either double-blind treatment with celecoxib or \nplacebo. Median PFS and overall survival (OS) times were shorter for XELIRI versus FOLFIRI (PFS \n5.9 versus 9.6 months and OS 14.8 versus 19.9 months), in addition to which excessive rates of \ndiarrhoea were reported in patients receiving the XELIRI regimen (41% XELIRI, 5.1% FOLFIRI). \n \nIn the study published by Skof et al, patients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI or XELIRI. \nOverall response rate was 49% in the XELIRI and 48% in the FOLFIRI arm (p=0.76). At the end of \ntreatment, 37% of patients in the XELIRI and 26% of patients in the FOLFIRI arm were without \nevidence of the disease (p=0.56). Toxcity was similar between treatments with the exception of \nneutropenia reported more commonly in patients treated with FOLFIRI. \n \nMontagnani et al used the results from the above three studies to provide an overall analysis of \nrandomised studies comparing FOLFIRI and XELIRI treatment regimens in the treatment of mCRC. \nA significant reduction in the risk of progression was associated with FOLFIRI (HR, 0.76; 95%CI, \n0.62-0.95; P <0.01), a result partly due to poor tolerance to the XELIRI regimens used. \n \nData from a randomised clinical study (Souglakos et al, 2012) comparing FOLFIRI + bevacizumab \nwith XELIRI + bevacizumab showed no significant differences in PFS or OS between treatments. \nPatients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (Arm-A, n=167) or XELIRI \nplus bevacizumab (Arm-B, n-166). For Arm B, the XELIRI regimen used capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 \ntwice daily for 14 days + irinotecan 250 mg/m2 on day 1. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was \n10.0 and 8.9 months; p=0.64, overall survival 25.7 and 27.5 months; p=0.55 and response rates 45.5 \nand 39.8%; p=0.32 for FOLFIRI-Bev and XELIRI-Bev, respectively. Patients treated with XELIRI + \nbevacizumab reported a significantly higher incidence of diarrhoea, febrile neutropenia and hand-foot \nskin reactions than patients treated with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab with significantly increased \ntreatment delays, dose reductions and treatment discontinuations. \n \nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase II study (AIO KRK 0604) supports the use of \ncapecitabine at a starting dose of 800 mg/m2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan \nand bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 120 Patients \nwere randomised to a modified XELIRI regimen with capecitabine 800 mg/m2 twice daily for two \nweeks followed by a 7-day rest period), irinotecan (200 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion on day 1 every \n3 weeks), and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks); 127 \npatients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for two weeks \nfollowed by a 7-day rest period), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 as a 2 hour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), \nand bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks). Following a mean \nduration of follow-up for the study population of 26.2 months, treatment responses were as shown \nbelow: \n \nTable 8 Key efficacy results for AIO KRK study \n XELOX + bevacizumab \n\n \n(ITT: N=127) \n\nModified XELIRI+ \nbevacizumab \n\n(ITT: N= 120) \n\nHazard ratio \n95% CI \nP value \n\nProgression-free Survival after 6 months \nITT \n95% CI \n\n76% \n69 - 84% \n\n84% \n77 - 90% - \n\n\n\n22 \n\nMedian progression free survival \nITT \n95% CI \n\n10.4 months \n9.0 - 12.0 \n\n12.1 months \n10.8 - 13.2 \n\n0.93 \n0.82 - 1.07 \n\nP=0.30 \nMedian overall survival \nITT \n95% CI \n\n24.4 months \n19.3 - 30.7 \n\n25.5 months \n21.0 - 31.0 \n\n0.90 \n0.68 - 1.19 \n\nP=0.45 \n \nCombination therapy in second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer \nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study (NO16967) support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin for the second-line treatment of metastastic colorectal \ncancer. In this trial, 627 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have received prior \ntreatment with irinotecan in combination with a fluoropyrimidine regimen as first line therapy were \nrandomised to treatment with XELOX or FOLFOX-4. For the dosing schedule of XELOX and \nFOLFOX-4 (without addition of placebo or bevacizumab), refer to table 6. XELOX was demonstrated \nto be non-inferior to FOLFOX-4 in terms of progression-free survival in the per-protocol population \nand intent-to-treat population (see table 9). The results indicate that XELOX is equivalent to \nFOLFOX-4 in terms of overall survival (see table 9).

In this trial, 160 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 \ntwice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 7-day rest period) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion \nevery 3 weeks). A total of 156 patients were randomised to treatment with 5-FU (800 mg/m2 per day, \ncontinuous infusion on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on day \n1, every 3 weeks). Capecitabine in combination with cisplatin was non-inferior to 5-FU in \ncombination with cisplatin in terms of progression-free survival in the per protocol analysis (hazard \n\n\n\n23 \n\nratio 0.81; 95% CI 0.63 - 1.04). The median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (capecitabine + \ncisplatin) versus 5.0 months (5-FU + cisplatin). The hazard ratio for duration of survival (overall \nsurvival) was similar to the hazard ratio for progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.85; 95% CI 0.64 - \n1.13). The median duration of survival was 10.5 months (capecitabine + cisplatin) versus 9.3 months \n(5-FU + cisplatin). \n \nData from a randomised multicentre, phase III study comparing capecitabine to 5-FU and oxaliplatin \nto cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the first-line \ntreatment of advanced gastric cancer (REAL-2). In this trial, 1002 patients were randomised in a 2x2 \nfactorial design to one of the following 4 arms: \n \n- ECF: epirubicin (50 mg/ m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m2 as a two \n\nhour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks) and 5-FU (200 mg/m2 daily given by continuous infusion \nvia a central line). \n\n- ECX: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m2 as a two \nhour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m2 twice daily continuously). \n\n- EOF: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 given as \na 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and 5-FU (200 mg/m2 daily given by continuous \ninfusion via a central line). \n\n- EOX: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 given as \na 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m2 twice daily \ncontinuously). \n\n \nThe primary efficacy analyses in the per protocol population demonstrated non-inferiority in overall \nsurvival for capecitabine- vs 5-FU-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.8 - 0.99) and for \noxaliplatin- vs cisplatin-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.80 - 1.1). The median overall \nsurvival was 10.9 months in capecitabine-based regimens and 9.6 months in 5-FU based regimens. \nThe median overall survival was 10.0 months in cisplatin-based regimens and 10.4 months in \noxaliplatin-based regimens. \n \nCapecitabine has also been used in combination with oxaliplatin for the treatment of advanced gastric \ncancer. Studies with capecitabine monotherapy indicate that capecitabine has activity in advanced \ngastric cancer. \n \nColon, colorectal and advanced gastric cancer: meta-analysis \nA meta-analysis of six clinical trials (studies SO14695, SO14796, M66001, NO16966, NO16967, \nM17032) supports capecitabine replacing 5-FU in mono- and combination treatment in gastrointestinal \ncancer. The pooled analysis includes 3097 patients treated with capecitabine-containing regimens and \n3074 patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. Median overall survival time was 703 days \n(95% CI: 671; 745) in patients treated with capecitabine-containing regimens and 683 days (95% CI: \n646; 715) in patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. The hazard ratio for overall survival was \n0.94 (95% CI: 0.89; 1.00, p=0.0489) indicating that capecitabine-containing regimens are non-inferior \nto 5-FU-containing regimens. \n \nBreast cancer \n \nCombination therapy with capecitabine and docetaxel in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with docetaxel for treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this \ntrial, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 \nweeks followed by 1-week rest period and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every \n3 weeks). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel \ncombination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator \nassessment) were 41.6% (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to \n\n\n\n24 \n\nprogressive disease was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel combination arm (p<0.0001). The \nmedian time to progression was 186 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine after failure of taxanes, anthracycline containing chemotherapy, and \nfor whom anthracycline therapy is not indicated \nData from two multicentre phase II clinical trials support the use of capecitabine monotherapy for \ntreatment of patients after failure of taxanes and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or \nfor whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated. In these trials, a total of 236 patients were \ntreated with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period). The \noverall objective response rates (investigator assessment) were 20% (first trial) and 25% (second trial). \nThe median time to progression was 93 and 98 days. Median survival was 384 and 373 days. \n \nAll indications: \n \nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with capecitabine \nmonotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer) showed that patients on capecitabine who \ndeveloped hand-foot syndrome (HFS) had a longer overall survival compared to patients who did not \ndevelop HFS: median overall survival 1100 days (95% CI 1007;1200) vs 691 days (95% CI 638;754) \nwith a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95% CI 0.56; 0.66). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of capecitabine have been evaluated over a dose range of 502-3514 mg/m2/day. \nThe parameters of capecitabine, 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) and 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine \n(5'-DFUR) measured on days 1 and 14 were similar. The AUC of 5-FU was 30%-35% higher on day \n14. Capecitabine dose reduction decreases systemic exposure to 5-FU more than dose-proportionally, \ndue to non-linear pharmacokinetics for the active metabolite. \n \nAbsorption \nAfter oral administration, capecitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed, followed by extensive \nconversion to the metabolites, 5'-DFCR and 5'-DFUR. Administration with food decreases the rate of \ncapecitabine absorption, but only results in a minor effect on the AUC of 5'-DFUR, and on the AUC of \nthe subsequent metabolite 5-FU. At the dose of 1250 mg/m2 on day 14 with administration after food \nintake, the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax in \u00b5g/ml) for capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and \nFBAL were 4.67, 3.05, 12.1, 0.95 and 5.46 respectively. The time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax \nin hours) were 1.50, 2.00, 2.00, 2.00 and 3.34. The AUC0-\u221e values in \u00b5g\u2022h/ml were 7.75, 7.24, 24.6, \n2.03 and 36.3. \n \nDistribution \nIn vitro human plasma studies have determined that capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR and 5-FU are \n54%, 10%, 62% and 10% protein bound, mainly to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \nCapecitabine is first metabolised by hepatic carboxylesterase to 5'-DFCR, which is then converted to \n5-DFUR by cytidine deaminase, principally located in the liver and tumour tissues. Further catalytic \nactivation of 5'-DFUR then occurs by thymidine phosphorylase (ThyPase). The enzymes involved in \nthe catalytic activation are found in tumour tissues but also in normal tissues, albeit usually at lower \nlevels. The sequential enzymatic biotransformation of capecitabine to 5-FU leads to higher \nconcentrations within tumour tissues. In the case of colorectal tumours, 5-FU generation appears to be \nin large part localised in tumour stromal cells. Following oral administration of capecitabine to \npatients with colorectal cancer, the ratio of 5-FU concentration in colorectal tumours to adjacent \ntissues was 3.2 (ranged from 0.9 to 8.0). The ratio of 5-FU concentration in tumour to plasma was 21.4 \n(ranged from 3.9 to 59.9, n=8) whereas the ratio in healthy tissues to plasma was 8.9 (ranged from 3.0 \nto 25.8, n=8). Thymidine phosphorylase activity was measured and found to be 4 times greater in \nprimary colorectal tumour than in adjacent normal tissue. According to immunohistochemical studies, \nthymidine phosphorylase appears to be in large part localised in tumour stromal cells. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n5-FU is further catabolised by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) to the much less \ntoxic dihydro-5-fluorouracil (FUH2). Dihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield \n5-fluoro-ureidopropionic acid (FUPA). Finally, \u03b2-ureido-propionase cleaves FUPA to \n\u03b1-fluoro-\u03b2-alanine (FBAL) which is cleared in the urine. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) \nactivity is the rate limiting step. Deficiency of DPD may lead to increased toxicity of capecitabine (see \nsection 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life (t1/2 in hours) of capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL were \n0.85, 1.11, 0.66, 0.76 and 3.23 respectively. Capecitabine and its metabolites are predominantly \nexcreted in urine; 95.5% of administered capecitabine dose is recovered in urine. Faecal excretion is \nminimal (2.6%). The major metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL, which represents 57% of the \nadministered dose. About 3% of the administered dose is excreted in urine unchanged. \n \nCombination therapy \nPhase I studies evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of either docetaxel or \npaclitaxel and vice versa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel or \npaclitaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by docetaxel or paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of \n5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after capecitabine treatment of 505 patients \nwith colorectal cancer dosed at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily. Gender, presence or absence of liver \nmetastasis at baseline, Karnofsky Performance Status, total bilirubin, serum albumin, ASAT and \nALAT had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL. \n \nHepatic impairment due to liver metastases. \nAccording to a pharmacokinetic study in cancer patients with mild to moderate liver impairment due \nto liver metastases, the bioavailability of capecitabine and exposure to 5-FU may increase compared to \npatients with no liver impairment. There are no pharmacokinetic data on patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nRenal impairment. \nBased on a pharmacokinetic study in cancer patients with mild to severe renal impairment, there is no \nevidence for an effect of creatinine clearance on the pharmacokinetics of intact drug and 5-FU. \nCreatinine clearance was found to influence the systemic exposure to 5\u2019-DFUR (35% increase in AUC \nwhen creatinine clearance decreases by 50%) and to FBAL (114% increase in AUC when creatinine \nclearance decreases by 50%). FBAL is a metabolite without antiproliferative activity. \n \nElderly. \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, which included patients with a wide range of ages \n(27 to 86 years) and included 234 (46%) patients greater or equal to 65, age has no influence on the \npharmacokinetics of 5'-DFUR and 5-FU. The AUC of FBAL increased with age (20% increase in age \nresults in a 15% increase in the AUC of FBAL). This increase is likely due to a change in renal \nfunction. \n \nEthnic factors. \nFollowing oral administration of 825 mg/m2 capecitabine twice daily for 14 days, Japanese patients \n(n=18) had about 36% lower Cmax and 24% lower AUC for capecitabine than Caucasian patients \n(n=22). Japanese patients had also about 25% lower Cmax and 34% lower AUC for FBAL than \nCaucasian patients. The clinical relevance of these differences is unknown. No significant differences \noccurred in the exposure to other metabolites (5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, and 5-FU). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies, daily oral administration of capecitabine to cynomolgus monkeys and \n\n\n\n26 \n\nmice produced toxic effects on the gastrointestinal, lymphoid and haemopoietic systems, typical for \nfluoropyrimidines. These toxicities were reversible. Skin toxicity, characterised by \ndegenerative/regressive changes, was observed with capecitabine. Capecitabine was devoid of hepatic \nand CNS toxicities. Cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. PR- and QT-interval prolongation) was detectable in \ncynomolgus monkeys after intravenous administration (100 mg/kg) but not after repeated oral dosing \n(1379 mg/m2/day). \n \nA two-year mouse carcinogenicity study produced no evidence of carcinogenicity by capecitabine. \n \nDuring standard fertility studies, impairment of fertility was observed in female mice receiving \ncapecitabine; however, this effect was reversible after a drug-free period. In addition, during a \n13-week study, atrophic and degenerative changes occurred in reproductive organs of male mice; \nhowever these effects were reversible after a drug-free period (see section 4.6). \n \nIn embryotoxicity and teratogenicity studies in mice, dose-related increases in foetal resorption and \nteratogenicity were observed. In monkeys, abortion and embryolethality were observed at high doses, \nbut there was no evidence of teratogenicity. \n \nCapecitabine was not mutagenic in vitro to bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian cells (Chinese hamster \nV79/HPRT gene mutation assay). However, similar to other nucleoside analogues (ie, 5-FU), \ncapecitabine was clastogenic in human lymphocytes (in vitro) and a positive trend occurred in mouse \nbone marrow micronucleus tests (in vivo). \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Ecansya is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Ecansya \n3. How to take Ecansya \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ecansya \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ecansya is and what it is used for \n \nEcansya belongs to the group of medicines called \"cytostatic medicines\", which stop the growth of \ncancer cells. Ecansya contains capecitabine, which itself is not a cytostatic medicine. Only after being \nabsorbed by the body is it changed into an active anti-cancer medicine (more in tumour tissue than in \nnormal tissue). \n \nEcansya is used in the treatment of colon, rectal, gastric, or breast cancers. \nFurthermore, Ecansya is used to prevent new occurrence of colon cancer after complete removal of the \ntumour by surgery. \n \nEcansya may be used either alone or in combination with other medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ecansya \n \nDo not take Ecansya \n- if you are allergic to capecitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). You must inform your doctor if you know that you have an allergy or over-reaction \nto this medicine, \n\n- if you previously have had severe reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy (a group of anticancer \nmedicines, such as fluorouracil), \n\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, \n- if you have severely low levels of white cells or platelets in the blood (leucopenia, neutropenia \n\nor thrombocytopenia), \n- if you have severe liver or kidney problems, \n- if you know that you do not have any activity of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase \n\n(DPD) (complete DPD deficiency), \n- if you are being treated now or have been treated in the last 4 weeks with brivudine as part of \n\nherpes zoster (chickenpox or shingles) therapy. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n\n\n44 \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ecansya \n- if you know that you have a partial  deficiency in the activity of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine \n\ndehydrogenase (DPD) \n- if you have a family member who has partial or complete deficiency of the enzyme \n\ndihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)   \n- if you have liver or kidney diseases \n- if you have or had heart problems (for example an irregular heartbeat or pains to the chest, jaw \n\nand back, brought on by physical effort and due to problems with the blood flow to the heart) \n- if you have brain diseases (for example, cancer that has spread to the brain) or nerve damage \n\n(neuropathy) \n- if you have calcium imbalances (seen in blood tests) \n- if you have diabetes \n- if you cannot keep food or water in your body because of severe nausea and vomiting \n- if you have diarrhoea \n- if you are or become dehydrated \n- if you have imbalances of ions in your blood (electrolyte imbalances, seen in tests) \n- if you have a history of eye problems as you may need extra monitoring of your eyes \n- if you have a severe skin reaction. \n \nDPD deficiency: DPD deficiency is a genetic condition that is not usually associated with health \nproblems unless you receive certain medicines. If you have DPD deficiency and take Ecansya, you are \nat an increased risk of severe side effects (listed under section 4 Possible side effects). It is \nrecommended to test you for DPD deficiency before start of treatment. If you have no activity of the \nenzyme you should not take Ecansya. If you have a reduced enzyme activity (partial deficiency) your \ndoctor might prescribe a reduced dose. If you have negative test results for DPD deficiency, severe \nand life-threatening side effects may still occur. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nEcansya is not indicated in children and adolescents. Do not give Ecansya to children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Ecansya \nBefore starting treatment, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might \ntake any other medicines. This is extremely important, as taking more than one medicine at the same \ntime can strengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines. \n \nYou must not take brivudine (an anti-viral medicine for the treatment of shingles or chickenpox) \nat the same time as capecitabine treatment (including during any rest periods when you are not \ntaking any capecitabine tablets). \n \nIf you have taken brivudine you must wait for at least 4 weeks after stopping brivudine before \nstarting to take capecitabine. See also section \"Do not take Ecansya\". \n \nAlso, you need to be particularly careful if you are taking any of the following: \n- gout medicines (allopurinol), \n- blood-thinning medicines (coumarin, warfarin), \n- medicines for seizures or tremors (phenytoin), \n- interferon alpha, \n- radiotherapy and certain medicines used to treat cancer (folinic acid, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, \n\ncisplatin, irinotecan), \n- medicines used to treat folic acid deficiency. \n \nEcansya with food and drink \nYou should take Ecansya no later than 30 minutes after meals. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. You must not take Ecansya if you \n\n\n\n45 \n\nare pregnant or think you might be.  \nYou must not breast-feed if you are taking Ecansya and for 2 weeks after the last dose. \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant you should use effective contraception during \ntreatment with Ecansya and for 6 months after the last dose. \nIf you are a male patient and your female partner could become pregnant, you should use effective \ncontraception during treatment with Ecansya and for 3 months after the last dose. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEcansya may make you feel dizzy, nauseous or tired. It is therefore possible that Ecansya could affect \nyour ability to drive a car or operate machines. \n \nEcansya contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Ecansya \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nCapecitabine should only be prescribed by a doctor experienced in the use of anticancer medicines. \n \nYour doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The dose of Ecansya is \nbased on your body surface area. This is calculated from your height and weight. The usual dose for \nadults is 1250 mg/m2 of body surface area taken two times daily (morning and evening). Two \nexamples are provided here: A person whose body weight is 64 kg and height is 1.64 m has a body \nsurface area of 1.7 m2 and should take 4 tablets of 500 mg and 1 tablet of 150 mg two times daily. A \nperson whose body weight is 80 kg and height is 1.80 m has a body surface area of 2.00 m2 and should \ntake 5 tablets of 500 mg two times daily. \n \nYour doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need \nto take it. \n \nYour doctor may want you to take a combination of 150 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg tablets for each dose. \n- Take the tablets morning and evening as prescribed by your doctor. \n- Take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner) and swallow \n\nwhole with water. Do not crush or cut tablets. If you cannot swallow Ecansya tablets \nwhole, tell your healthcare provider. \n\n- It is important that you take all your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. \n \nEcansya tablets are usually taken for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no tablets are \ntaken). This 21 day period is one treatment cycle. \n \nIn combination with other medicines the usual dose for adults may be less than 1250 mg/m2 of body \nsurface area, and you may need to take the tablets over a different time period (e.g. every day, with no \nrest period). \n \nIf you take more Ecansya than you should \nIf you take more Ecansya than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible before taking the \nnext dose. \nYou might get the following side effects if you take a lot more capecitabine than you should: feeling \nor being sick, diarrhoea, inflammation or ulceration of the gut or mouth, pain or bleeding from the \nintestine or stomach, or bone marrow depression (reduction in certain kinds of blood cells). Tell your \ndoctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. \n \nIf you forget to take Ecansya \n\n\n\n46 \n\nDo not take the missed dose at all. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Instead, \ncontinue your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor. \n \nIf you stop taking Ecansya \nThere are no side-effects caused by stopping treatment with capecitabine. In case you are using \ncoumarin anticoagulants (containing e.g. phenprocoumon), stopping capecitabine might require that \nyour doctor adjusts your anticoagulant dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSTOP taking Ecansya immediately and contact your doctor if any of these symptoms occur: \n- Diarrhoea: if you have an increase of 4 or more bowel movements compared to your normal \n\nbowel movements each day or any diarrhoea at night. \n- Vomiting: if you vomit more than once in a 24-hour time period. \n- Nausea: if you lose your appetite, and the amount of food you eat each day is much less than \n\nusual. \n- Stomatitis: if you have pain, redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat. \n- Hand-and-foot skin-reaction: if you have pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or \n\nfeet. \n- Fever: if you have a temperature of 38\u00b0C or greater. \n- Infection: if you experience signs of infection caused by bacteria or virus, or other organisms. \n- Chest pain: if you experience pain localised to the centre of the chest, especially if it occurs \n\nduring exercise. \n- Steven-Johnson syndrome: if you experience painful red or purplish rash that spreads and \n\nblisters and/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g. mouth and lips), in \nparticular if you had before light sensitivity, infections of the respiratory system (e.g. bronchitis) \nand/or fever. \n\n- DPD deficiency: if you have a known DPD deficiency, you are at an increased risk of acute \nearly-onset of toxicity and severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse reactions caused by Ecansya \n(e.g. stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, diarrhoea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity). \n\n \nIf caught early, these side effects usually improve within 2 to 3 days after treatment discontinuation. If \nthese side effects continue, however, contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor may instruct you \nto restart treatment at a lower dose. \n \nIf severe stomatitis (sores in your mouth and/or throat), mucosal inflammation, diarrhoea, neutropenia \n(increased risk for infections), or neurotoxicity occurs during the first cycle of treatment a DPD \ndeficiency may be involved (please see Section 2: Warning and precautions). \n \nHand and foot skin reaction can lead to loss of fingerprint, which could impact your identification by \nfingerprint scan. \n \nIn addition to the above, when Ecansya is used alone, very common side effects, which may affect \nmore than 1 in 10 people are: \n- abdominal pain \n- rash, dry or itchy skin \n- tiredness \n- loss of appetite (anorexia) \n \nThese side effects can become severe; therefore, it is important that you always contact your doctor \nimmediately when you start to experience a side effect. Your doctor may instruct you to decrease the \ndose and/or temporarily discontinue treatment with Ecansya. This will help reduce the likelihood that \n\n\n\n47 \n\nthe side effect continues or becomes severe. \n \nOther side effects are: \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) include: \n- decreases in the number of white blood cells or red blood cells (seen in tests) \n- dehydration, weight loss \n- sleeplessness (insomnia), depression \n- headache, sleepiness, dizziness, abnormal sensation in the skin (numbness or tingling \n\nsensation), taste changes \n- eye irritation, increased tears, eye redness (conjunctivitis) \n- inflammation of the veins (thrombophlebitis) \n- shortness of breath, nose bleeds, cough, runny nose \n- cold sores or other herpes infections \n- infections of the lungs or respiratory system (e.g. pneumonia or bronchitis) \n- bleeding from the gut, constipation, pain in upper abdomen, indigestion, excess wind, dry mouth \n- skin rash, hair loss (alopecia), skin reddening, dry skin, itching (pruritus), skin discolouration, \n\nskin loss, skin inflammation, nail disorder \n- pain in the joints or in the limbs (extremities), chest or back \n- fever, swelling in the limbs, feeling ill \n- problems with liver function (seen in blood tests) and increased blood bilirubin (excreted by the \n\nliver) \n \nUncommon side-effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) include: \n- blood infection, urinary tract infection, infection of the skin, infections in the nose and throat, \n\nfungal infections (including those of the mouth), influenza, gastroenteritis, tooth abscess \n- lumps under the skin (lipoma) \n- decreases in blood cells including platelets, thinning of blood (seen in tests) \n- allergy \n- diabetes, decrease in blood potassium, malnutrition, increased blood triglycerides \n- confusional state, panic attacks, depressed mood, decreased libido \n- difficulty speaking, impaired memory, loss of movement coordination, balance disorder, \n\nfainting, nerve damage (neuropathy) and problems with sensation \n- blurred or double vision \n- vertigo, ear pain \n- irregular heartbeat and palpitations (arrhythmias), chest pain and heart attack (infarction), \n- blood clots in the deep veins, high or low blood pressure, hot flushes, cold limbs (extremities), \n\npurple spots on the skin \n- blood clots in the veins in the lung (pulmonary embolism), collapsed lung, coughing up blood, \n\nasthma, shortness of breath on exertion \n- bowel obstruction, collection of fluid in the abdomen, inflammation of the small or large \n\nintestine, the stomach or the oesophagus, pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal discomfort, \nheartburn (reflux of food from the stomach), blood in the stool \n\n- jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) \n- skin ulcer and blister, reaction of the skin with sunlight, reddening of palms, swelling or pain of \n\nthe face \n- joint swelling or stiffness, bone pain, muscle weakness or stiffness \n- fluid collection in the kidneys, increased frequency of urination during the night, incontinence, \n\nblood in the urine, increase in blood creatinine (sign of kidney dysfunction) \n- unusual bleeding from the vagina \n- swelling (oedema), chills and rigors \n \nSome of these side effects are more common when capecitabine is used with other medicines for the \ntreatment of cancer.

usually associated with health problems unless you receive certain medicines. if you have dpd deficiency and take ecansya, you are at an increased risk of severe side effects (listed under section 4 possible side effects). it is recommended to test you for dpd deficiency before start of treatment. if you have no activity of the enzyme you should not take ecansya. if you have a reduced enzyme activity (partial deficiency) your doctor might prescribe a reduced dose. if you have negative test results for dpd deficiency, severe and life-threatening side effects may still occur. children and adolescents ecansya is not indicated in children and adolescents. do not give ecansya to children and adolescents. other medicines and ecansya before starting treatment, tell your doctor or pharmacist

"always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. capecitabine should only be prescribed by a doctor experienced in the use of anticancer medicines. your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. the dose of ecansya is based on your body surface area. this is calculated from your height and weight. the usual dose for adults is 1250 mg/m2 of body surface area taken two times daily (morning and evening). two examples are provided here: a person whose body weight is 64 kg and height is 1.64 m has a body surface area of 1.7 m2 and should take 4 tablets of 500 mg and 1 tablet of 150 mg two times daily. a person whose body weight is 80 kg and height is 1.80 m has a body surface area of 2.00 m2 and should take 5 tablets of 500 mg two times daily. your doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need to take it. your doctor may want you to take a combination of 150 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg tablets for each dose. - take the tablets morning and evening as prescribed by your doctor. - take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner) and swallow whole with water. do not crush or cut tablets. if you cannot swallow ecansya tablets whole, tell your healthcare provider. - it is important that you take all your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. ecansya tablets are usually taken for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no tablets are taken). this 21 day period is one treatment cycle. in combination with other medicines the usual dose for adults may be less than 1250 mg/m2 of body surface area, and you may need to take the tablets over a different time period (e.g. every day, with no rest period). if you take more ecansya than you should if you take more ecansya than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible before taking the next dose. you might get the following side effects if you take a lot more capecitabine than you should: feeling or being sick, diarrhoea, inflammation or ulceration of the gut or mouth, pain or bleeding from the intestine or stomach, or bone marrow depression (reduction in certain kinds of blood cells). tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. if you forget to take ecansya 46 do not take the missed dose at all. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. instead, continue your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor. if you stop taking ecansya there are no side-effects caused by stopping treatment with capecitabine. in case you are using coumarin anticoagulants (containing e.g. phenprocoumon), stopping capecitabine might require that your doctor adjusts your anticoagulant dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ecansya", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",

possible side effects", "Section_Content": "like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. stop taking ecansya immediately and contact your doctor if any of these symptoms occur: - diarrhoea: if you have an increase of 4 or more bowel movements compared to your normal bowel movements each day or any diarrhoea at night. - vomiting: if you vomit more than once in a 24-hour time period. - nausea: if you lose your appetite, and the amount of food you eat each day is much less than usual. - stomatitis: if you have pain, redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat. - hand-and-foot skin-reaction: if you have pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or feet. - fever: if you have a temperature of 38 or greater. - infection: if you experience signs of infection caused by bacteria or virus, or other organisms. - chest pain: if you experience pain localised to the centre of the chest, especially if it occurs during exercise. - steven-johnson syndrome: if you experience painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters and/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g. mouth and lips), in particular if you had before light sensitivity, infections of the respiratory system (e.g. bronchitis) and/or fever. - dpd deficiency: if you have a known dpd deficiency, you are at an increased risk of acute early-onset of toxicity and severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse reactions caused by ecansya (e.g. stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, diarrhoea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity). if caught early, these side effects usually improve within 2 to 3 days after treatment discontinuation. if these side effects continue, however, contact your doctor immediately. your doctor may instruct you to restart treatment at a lower dose. if severe stomatitis (sores in your mouth and/or throat), mucosal inflammation, diarrhoea, neutropenia (increased risk for infections), or neurotoxicity occurs during the first cycle of treatment a dpd deficiency may be involved (please see section 2: warning and precautions). hand and foot skin reaction can lead to loss of fingerprint, which could impact your identification by fingerprint scan. in addition to the above, when ecansya is used alone, very common side effects, which may affect more than 1 in 10 people are: - abdominal pain - rash, dry or itchy skin - tiredness - loss of appetite (anorexia) these side effects can become severe; therefore, it is important that you always contact your doctor immediately when you start to experience a side effect. your doctor may instruct you to decrease the dose and/or temporarily discontinue treatment with ecansya. this will help reduce the likelihood that 47 the side effect continues or becomes severe. other side effects are: common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) include: - decreases in the number of white blood cells or red blood cells (seen in tests) - dehydration, weight loss - sleeplessness (insomnia), depression - headache, sleepiness, dizziness, abnormal sensation in the skin (numbness or tingling sensation), taste changes - eye irritation, increased tears, eye redness (conjunctivitis) - inflammation of the veins (thrombophlebitis) - shortness of breath, nose bleeds, cough, runny nose - cold sores or other herpes infections - infections of the lungs or respiratory system (e.g. pneumonia or bronchitis) - bleeding from the gut, constipation, pain in upper abdomen, indigestion, excess wind, dry mouth - skin rash, hair loss (alopecia), skin reddening, dry skin, itching (pruritus), skin discolouration, skin loss, skin inflammation, nail disorder - pain in the joints or in the limbs (extremities), chest or back - fever, swelling in the limbs, feeling ill - problems with liver function (seen in blood tests) and increased blood bilirubin (excreted by the liver) uncommon side-effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) include: - blood infection, urinary tract infection, infection of the skin, infections in the nose and throat, fungal infections (including those of the mouth), influenza, gastroenteritis, tooth abscess - lumps under the skin (lipoma) - decreases in blood cells including platelets, thinning of blood (seen in tests) - allergy - diabetes, decrease in blood potassium, malnutrition, increased blood triglycerides - confusional state, panic attacks, depressed mood, decreased libido - difficulty speaking, impaired memory, loss of movement coordination, balance disorder, fainting, nerve damage (neuropathy) and problems with sensation - blurred or double vision - vertigo, ear pain - irregular heartbeat and palpitations (arrhythmias), chest pain and heart attack (infarction), - blood clots in the deep veins, high or low blood pressure, hot flushes, cold limbs (extremities), purple spots on the skin - blood clots in the veins in the lung (pulmonary embolism), collapsed lung, coughing up blood, asthma, shortness of breath on exertion - bowel obstruction, collection of fluid in the abdomen, inflammation of the small or large intestine, the stomach or the oesophagus, pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal discomfort, heartburn (reflux of food from the stomach), blood in the stool - jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) - skin ulcer and blister, reaction of the skin with sunlight, reddening of palms, swelling or pain of the face - joint swelling or stiffness, bone pain, muscle weakness or stiffness - fluid collection in the kidneys, increased frequency of urination during the night, incontinence, blood in the urine, increase in blood creatinine (sign of kidney dysfunction) - unusual bleeding from the vagina - swelling (oedema), chills and rigors some of these side effects are more common when capecitabine is used with other medicines for the treatment of cancer. other side-effects seen in this setting are the following: common side-effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) include: - decrease in blood sodium, magnesium or calcium, increase in blood sugar 48 - nerve pain - ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus), loss of hearing - vein inflammation - hiccups, change in voice - pain or altered/abnormal sensation in the mouth, pain in the jaw - sweating, night sweats - muscle spasm - difficulty in urination, blood or protein in the urine - bruising or reaction at the injection site (caused by medicines given by injection at the same time) rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) include: - narrowing or blockage of tear duct (lacrimal duct stenosis) - liver failure - inflammation leading to dysfunction or obstruction in bile secretion (cholestatic hepatitis) - specific changes in the electrocardiogram (qt prolongation) - certain types of arrhythmia (including ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes, and bradycardia) - eye inflammation causing eye pain and possibly eyesight problems - inflammation of the skin causing red scaly patches due to
