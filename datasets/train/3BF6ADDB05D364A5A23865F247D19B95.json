NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nThyrogen 0.9 mg powder for solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach vial of Thyrogen contains a nominal value of 0.9 mg thyrotropin alfa. Following reconstitution, each \n\nvial of Thyrogen contains 0.9 mg of thyrotropin alfa in 1.0 ml.  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder for solution for injection. \n\nWhite to off-white lyophilised powder. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nThyrogen is indicated for use with serum thyroglobulin (Tg) testing with or without radioiodine imaging \n\nfor the detection of thyroid remnants and well-differentiated thyroid cancer in post-thyroidectomy patients \n\nmaintained on hormone suppression therapy (THST). \n\n \n\nLow risk patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma who have undetectable serum Tg levels on \n\nTHST and no rh (recombinant human) TSH-stimulated increase of Tg levels may be followed-up by \n\nassaying rhTSH-stimulated Tg levels. \n\n \n\nThyrogen is indicated for pre-therapeutic stimulation in combination with a range of 30 mCi (1.1 GBq) to \n\n100 mCi (3.7 GBq) radioiodine for ablation of thyroid tissue remnants in patients who have undergone a \n\nnear-total or total thyroidectomy for well-differentiated thyroid cancer and who do not have evidence of \n\ndistant metastatic thyroid cancer (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy should be supervised by physicians with expertise in thyroid cancer. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose regimen is two doses of 0.9 mg thyrotropin alfa administered at a 24-hour interval \n\nby intramuscular injection only. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nDue to a lack of data on the use of Thyrogen in children, Thyrogen should be given to children only in \n\nexceptional circumstances. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nElderly  \n\nResults from controlled trials indicate no difference in the safety and efficacy of Thyrogen between adult \n\npatients less than 65 years and those greater than 65 years of age, when Thyrogen is used for diagnostic \n\npurposes. \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPatients with renal/hepatic impairment \n\nInformation from post marketing surveillance, as well as published information, suggests that elimination \n\nof Thyrogen is significantly slower in dialysis-dependent end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, \n\nresulting in prolonged elevation of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels for several days after \n\ntreatment. This may lead to increased risk of headache and nausea. There are no studies of alternative dose \n\nschedules of Thyrogen in patients with ESRD to guide dose reduction in this population. \n\n \n\nIn patients with significant renal impairment the activity of radioiodine should be carefully selected by the \n\nnuclear medicine physician. \n\n \n\nThe use of Thyrogen in patients with reduced liver function does not warrant special considerations.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nAfter reconstitution with water for injection, 1.0 ml solution (0.9 mg thyrotropin alfa) is administered by \n\nintramuscular injection to the buttock. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before \n\nadministration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nFor radioiodine imaging or ablation, radioiodine administration should be given 24 hours following the \n\nfinal Thyrogen injection. Diagnostic scintigraphy should be performed 48 to 72 hours following \n\nradioiodine administration, whereas post-ablation scintigraphy may be delayed additional days to allow \n\nbackground activity to decline. \n\n \n\nFor diagnostic follow-up serum thyroglobulin (Tg) testing, the serum sample should be obtained 72 hours \n\nafter the final injection of Thyrogen. Use of Thyrogen with Tg testing in follow up of post-thyroidectomy \n\nwell differentiated thyroid cancer patients should be in accordance with official guidelines. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to bovine or human thyroid stimulating hormone or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1.  \n\n\u2022 Pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThyrogen should not be administered intravenously.  \n\n \n\nWhen used as an alternative to thyroid hormone withdrawal, the combination of the whole body \n\nscintigraphy (WBS) and Tg testing after Thyrogen administration assures the highest sensitivity for \n\ndetection of thyroid remnants or cancer. False negative results may occur with Thyrogen. If a high index \n\nof suspicion for metastatic disease persists, a confirmatory withdrawal WBS and Tg testing should be \n\nconsidered. \n\n \n\nThe presence of Tg autoantibodies can be expected in 18-40% of patients with differentiated thyroid \n\ncancer and may cause false negative serum Tg measurements. Therefore, both TgAb and Tg assays are \n\nneeded. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nCareful evaluation of benefit-risk relationships should be assessed for Thyrogen administration in high \n\nrisk elderly patients who have heart disease (e.g. valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery \n\ndisease, and prior or current tachyarrhythmia including atrial fibrillation) and have not undergone \n\nthyroidectomy. \n\n \n\nThyrogen is known to cause a transient but significant rise in serum thyroid hormone concentration when \n\ngiven to patients who have substantial thyroid tissue still in situ.  Therefore, careful evaluation of \n\nindividual risk-benefit is necessary for patients with significant residual thyroid tissue.  \n\n \n\n \n\nEffect on tumour growth and/or size  \n\nIn patients with thyroid cancer, several cases of stimulated tumour growth have been reported during \n\nwithdrawal of thyroid hormones for diagnostic procedures which have been attributed to the associated \n\nprolonged elevation of TSH levels. \n\nThere is a theoretical possibility that Thyrogen, like thyroid hormone withdrawal, may lead to stimulated \n\ntumour growth. In clinical trials with thyrotropin alfa, which produces a short-term increase in serum TSH \n\nlevels, no case of tumour growth has been reported.  \n\n \n\nDue to elevation of TSH levels after Thyrogen administration patients with metastatic thyroid cancer \n\nparticularly in confined spaces such as the brain, spinal cord and orbit or disease infiltrating the neck, may \n\nexperience local oedema or focal haemorrhage at the site of these metastases resulting in increased tumour \n\nsize. This may lead to acute symptoms, which depend on the anatomical location of the tissue e.g. \n\nhemiplegia, hemiparesis, loss of vision have occurred in patients with CNS metastases. Laryngeal oedema, \n\nrespiratory distress requiring tracheotomy, and pain at the site of metastasis have also been reported after \n\nThyrogen administration. It is recommended that pre-treatment with corticosteroids be considered for \n\npatients in whom local tumour expansion may compromise vital anatomic structures. \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium- \n\nfree\u2019. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nFormal interaction studies between Thyrogen and other medicinal products have not been performed. In \n\nclinical trials, no interactions were observed between Thyrogen and the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine \n\n(T3) and thyroxine (T4) when administered concurrently. \n\n \n\nThe use of Thyrogen allows for radioiodine imaging while patients are euthyroid on thyroid hormone \n\nsuppression treatment. Data on radioiodine kinetics indicate that the clearance of radioiodine is \n\napproximately 50% greater while euthyroid than during the hypothyroid state when renal function is \n\ndecreased, thus resulting in less radioiodine retention in the body at the time of imaging. This factor \n\nshould be considered when selecting the activity of radioiodine for use in radioiodine imaging. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Thyrogen.  \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether Thyrogen can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or \n\nwhether Thyrogen can affect reproductive capacity. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThyrogen in combination with diagnostic radioiodine whole body scintigraphy is contra-indicated in \n\npregnancy (see section 4.3), because of the consequent exposure of the foetus to a high dose of radioactive \n\nmaterial.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether thyrotropin alfa /metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nsuckling child cannot be excluded. Thyrogen should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \n\nFertility \n\nIt is not known whether Thyrogen can affect fertility in humans. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nThyrogen may reduce the ability to drive or use machines, since dizziness and headaches have been \n\nreported. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are nausea and headache, occurring in approximately \n\n11%, and 6% of patients, respectively. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions mentioned in the table, combine adverse reactions in the six prospective clinical \n\ntrials (N=481) and undesirable effects that have been reported to Genzyme after licensure of Thyrogen. \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The \n\nreporting rate is classified as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n\n<1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data).  \n\n \n\nMedDRA System \n\nOrgan Class \n\nVery  \n\nCommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\n  influenza  \n\nNeoplasm benign, \n\nmalignant and \n\nunspecified (incl. \n\ncysts and polyps) \n\n   neoplasm swelling, \n\nmetastatic pain \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\n dizziness, headache ageusia, \n\ndysgeusia, \n\nparaesthesia \n\nstroke, tremor  \n\nCardiac disorders    palpitations \n\nVascular disorders    flushing \n\nRespiratory, \n\nthoracic and \n\nmediastinal \n\ndisorder \n\n   dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nnausea vomiting diarrhoea  \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  urticaria, rash pruritus, \n\nhyperhidrosis \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMusculoskeletal \n\nand connective \n\ntissue disorder \n\n  neck pain, back \n\npain \n\narthralgia, myalgia \n\nGeneral disorders \n\nand administration \n\nsite conditions \n\n fatigue, asthenia influenza like \n\nillness, pyrexia, \n\nchills,  feeling \n\nhot \n\ndiscomfort, pain, \n\npruritus, rash and \n\nurticaria at the site of \n\ninjection \n\nInvestigations    TSH decreased \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nVery rare cases of hyperthyroidism or atrial fibrillation have been observed when Thyrogen 0.9 mg has \n\nbeen administered in patients with presence of either partial or entire thyroid gland.  \n\n \n\nManifestations of hypersensitivity have been reported uncommonly in both clinical and post-marketing \n\nsettings. These reactions consisted of urticaria, rash, pruritus, flushing and respiratory signs and \n\nsymptoms.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials involving 481 patients, no patients have developed antibodies to thyrotropin alfa either \n\nafter single or repeated limited (27 patients) use of the product. It is not recommended to perform TSH \n\nassays after Thyrogen administration. The occurrence of antibodies which could interfere with \n\nendogenous TSH assays performed during regular follow-ups cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nEnlargement of residual thyroid tissue or metastases can occur following treatment with Thyrogen. This \n\nmay lead to acute symptoms, which depend on the anatomical location of the tissue. For example, \n\nhemiplegia, hemiparesis or loss of vision have occurred in patients with CNS metastases. Laryngeal \n\noedema, respiratory distress requiring tracheotomy, and pain at the site of metastasis have also been \n\nreported after Thyrogen administration. It is recommended that pre-treatment with corticosteroids be \n\nconsidered for patients in whom local tumour expansion may compromise vital anatomic structures. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \n\nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nData on exposure above the recommended dose is limited to clinical studies and a special treatment \n\nprogram.  Three patients in clinical trials and one patient in the special treatment program experienced \n\nsymptoms after receiving Thyrogen doses higher than those recommended. Two patients had nausea after \n\n2.7 mg IM dose, and in one of these patients nausea was also accompanied by weakness, dizziness and \n\nheadache.  The third patient experienced nausea, vomiting and hot flushes after 3.6 mg IM dose.  In the \n\nspecial treatment program, a 77 year-old patient with metastatic thyroid cancer who had not been \n\nthyroidectomised received 4 doses of Thyrogen 0.9 mg over 6 days, developed atrial fibrillation, cardiac \n\ndecompensation and terminal myocardial infarction 2 days later.   \n\n \n\nOne additional patient enrolled in a clinical trial experienced symptoms after receiving Thyrogen \n\nintravenously.  This patient received 0.3 mg of Thyrogen as a single intravenous (IV) bolus and, 15 \n\nminutes later experienced severe nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, hypotension and tachycardia. \n\n \n\nA suggested treatment in case of overdose would be the reestablishment of fluid balance and \n\nadministration of an antiemetic may also be considered. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and Hypothalamic Hormones and Analogues, Anterior Pituitary \n\nLobe Hormones and Analogues. ATC code for thyrotropin alfa: H01AB01 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThyrotropin alfa (recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein \n\nproduced by recombinant DNA technology. It is comprised of two non-covalently linked subunits. The \n\ncDNAs encode for an alpha subunit of 92 amino acid residues containing two N-linked glycosylation \n\nsites, and a beta subunit of 118 residues containing one N-linked glycosylation site. It has comparable \n\nbiochemical properties to natural human Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Binding of thyrotropin alfa \n\nto TSH receptors on thyroid epithelial cells stimulates iodine uptake and organification, and synthesis and \n\nrelease of thyroglobulin, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). \n\n \n\nIn patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer, a near total or total thyroidectomy is performed. For \n\noptimal diagnosis of thyroid remnants or cancer via either radioiodine imaging or thyroglobulin testing \n\nand for radioiodine therapy of thyroid remnants, a high serum level of TSH is needed to stimulate either \n\nradioiodine uptake and/or thyroglobulin release. The standard approach to achieve elevated TSH levels \n\nhas been to withdraw patients from thyroid hormone suppression therapy (THST), which usually causes \n\npatients to experience the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. With the use of Thyrogen, the TSH \n\nstimulation necessary for radioiodine uptake and thyroglobulin release is achieved while patients are \n\nmaintained euthyroid on THST, thus avoiding the morbidity associated with hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nDiagnostic use  \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Thyrogen for use with radioiodine imaging together with serum thyroglobulin \n\ntesting for the diagnosis of thyroid remnants and cancer was demonstrated in two studies. In one of the \n\nstudies, two dose regimens were examined: 0.9 mg intramuscular every 24 hours for two doses (0.9 mg x \n\n2) and 0.9 mg intramuscular every 72 hours for three doses (0.9 mg x 3). Both dose regimens were \n\neffective and not statistically different from thyroid hormone withdrawal in stimulating radioiodine uptake \n\nfor diagnostic imaging. Both dose regimens improved the sensitivity, accuracy and negative predictive \n\nvalue of Thyrogen-stimulated thyroglobulin alone or in combination with radioiodine imaging as \n\ncompared to testing performed while patients remained on thyroid hormones.  \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, for the detection of thyroid remnants or cancer in ablated patients using a thyroglobulin \n\nassay with a lower limit of detection of 0.5 ng/ml, Thyrogen-stimulated thyroglobulin levels of 3 ng/ml, \n\n2 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml corresponded with thyroglobulin levels after withdrawal of thyroid hormone of \n\n10 ng/ml, 5 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml, respectively. In these studies the use of thyroglobulin testing on Thyrogen \n\nwas found to be more sensitive than thyroglobulin testing on TSHT. Specifically in a Phase III study \n\ninvolving 164 patients the detection rate of tissue of thyroid origin after a Thyrogen thyroglobulin test \n\nranged from 73-87%, whereas, by using thyroglobulin on TSHT it was 42-62% for the same cut-off values \n\nand comparable reference standards.  \n\n \n\nMetastatic disease was confirmed by a post-treatment scan or by lymph node biopsy in 35 patients. \n\nThyrogen-stimulated thyroglobulin levels were above 2 ng/ml in all 35 patients, whereas, thyroglobulin on \n\nTHST was above 2 ng/ml in 79% of these patients. \n\n \n\nPre-therapeutic stimulation  \n\nIn a comparator study involving 60 evaluable patients, the rates of successful ablation of thyroid remnants \n\nwith 100 mCi/3.7 GBq (\u00b1 10%) radioiodine in post-thyroidectomy patients with thyroid cancer, were \n\n\n\n8 \n\ncomparable for patients treated after thyroid hormone withdrawal versus patients treated after Thyrogen \n\nadministration. Patients studied were adults (>18 years), with newly diagnosed differentiated papillary or \n\nfollicular thyroid carcinoma, including papillary-follicular variant, characterised, principally (54 of 60), as \n\nT1-T2, N0-N1, M0 (TNM classification). Success of remnant ablation was assessed with radioiodine \n\nimaging and with serum thyroglobulin testing at 8 \u00b1 1 months after treatment. All 28 patients (100%) \n\ntreated after withdrawal of THST and all 32 patients (100%) treated after Thyrogen administration had \n\neither no visible uptake of radioiodine in the thyroid bed or, if visible, thyroid bed uptake <0.1% of the \n\nadministered activity of radioiodine. The success of thyroid remnant ablation also was assessed by the \n\ncriterion of Thyrogen-stimulated serum Tg level < 2 ng/ml eight months after ablation, but only in patients \n\nwho were negative for interfering anti-Tg antibodies. Using this Tg criterion, 18/21 patients (86%) and \n\n23/24 patients (96%) had thyroid remnants successfully ablated in the THST withdrawal group and the \n\nThyrogen treatment group, respectively.  \n\n \n\nQuality of life was significantly reduced following thyroid hormone withdrawal, but maintained following \n\neither dosage regimen of Thyrogen in both indications.  \n\n \n\nA follow-up study was conducted on patients who previously completed the initial study, and data is \n\navailable for 51 patients. The main objective of the follow-up study was to confirm the status of thyroid \n\nremnant ablation by using Thyrogen-stimulated radioiodine static neck imaging after a median follow-up \n\nof 3.7 years (range 3.4 to 4.4 years) following radioiodine ablation. Thyrogen-stimulated thyroglobulin \n\ntesting was also performed.  \n\n \n\nPatients were still considered to be successfully ablated if there was no visible thyroid bed uptake on the \n\nscan, or if visible, uptake was less than 0.1%. All patients considered ablated in the initial study were \n\nconfirmed to be ablated in the follow-up study. In addition, no patient had a definitive recurrence during \n\nthe 3.7 years of follow-up. Overall, 48/51 patients (94%) had no evidence of cancer recurrence, 1 patient \n\nhad possible cancer recurrence (although it was not clear whether this patient had a true recurrence or \n\npersistent tumour from the regional disease noted at the start of the original study), and 2 patients could \n\nnot be assessed. \n\n \n\nIn summary, in the pivotal study and its follow-up study, Thyrogen was non-inferior to thyroid hormone \n\nwithdrawal for elevation of TSH levels for pre-therapeutic stimulation in combination with radioiodine for \n\npost-surgical ablation of remnant thyroid tissue. \n\n \n\nTwo large prospective randomised studies, the HiLo study (Mallick) and the ESTIMABL1 study \n\n(Schlumberger), compared methods of thyroid remnant ablation in patients with differentiated thyroid \n\ncancer who had been thyroidectomised. In both studies, patients were randomised to 1 of 4 treatment \n\ngroups: Thyrogen + 30 mCi 131I, Thyrogen + 100 mCi 131I, thyroid hormone withdrawal + 30 mCi 131I, or \n\nthyroid hormone withdrawal + 100 mCi 131I, and patients were assessed about 8 months later. The HiLo \n\nstudy randomised 438 patients (tumour stages T1-T3, Nx, N0 and N1, M0) at 29 centres. As assessed by \n\nradioiodine imaging and stimulated Tg levels (n = 421), ablation success rates were approximately 86% in \n\nall four treatment groups. All 95% confidence intervals for the differences were within \u00b110 percentage \n\npoints, indicating in particular non-inferiority of the low to the high radioiodineactivity. Analyses of T3 \n\npatients and N1 patients showed that these subgroups had equally good ablation success rates as did \n\nlower-risk patients. The ESTIMABL1 study randomised 752 patients with low-risk thyroid cancer \n\n(tumour stages pT1 < 1 cm and N1 or Nx, pT1 >1-2 cm and any N stage, or pT2 N0, all patients M0) at 24 \n\ncentres. Based on 684 evaluable patients, the overall ablation success rate assessed by neck ultrasounds \n\nand stimulated Tg levels was 92%, without any statistically significant difference among the four groups.  \n\n \n\nFor the ESTIMABL1 study, 726 (97%) of the original 752 patients were followed up for disease \n\nrecurrence. The median follow-up was 5.4 years (0.5 to 9.2 years). \n\n \n\nThe tables below provide long term follow up information for the ESTIMABL1 and HiLo studies \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Thyrotropin alfa was non-inferior to thyroid hormone withdrawal for pre-\n\ntherapeutic stimulation in combination with radioiodine for post-surgical ablation of thyroid remnant \n\ntissue.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Thyrogen were studied in patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer \n\nfollowing a single 0.9 mg intramuscular injection. After injection, the mean peak (Cmax) level obtained \n\nwas 116 \u00b1 38 mU/l and occurred approximately 13 \u00b1 8 hours after administration. The elimination half-\n\nlife was 22 \u00b1 9 hours. The major elimination route of thyrotropin alfa is believed to be renal and to a lesser \n\nextent hepatic. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data are limited, but reveal no special hazard for humans from use of Thyrogen. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Swirl the contents of the vial gently \n\nuntil all material is dissolved. Do not shake the solution. When the powder is dissolved the total volume in \n\nthe vial is 1.2 ml. The pH of the Thyrogen solution is approximately 7.0. \n\n \n\nVisually inspect the Thyrogen solution in the vial for foreign particles and discoloration. The Thyrogen \n\nsolution should be a clear, colourless solution. Do not use vials exhibiting foreign particles, cloudiness or \n\ndiscoloration. \n\n \n\nWithdraw 1.0 ml of the Thyrogen solution from the product vial. This equals 0.9 mg thyrotropin alfa to be \n\ninjected. \n\n \n\nThyrogen does not contain preservatives. Dispose of any unused solution immediately. No special \n\nrequirements for disposal. \n\n \n\nThe Thyrogen solution should be injected within three hours, however the Thyrogen solution will stay \n\nchemically stable for up to 24 hours, if kept in a refrigerator (between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). It is important to note \n\nthat the microbiological safety depends on the aseptic conditions during the preparation of the solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nThyrogen 0.9 mg powder for solution for injection \n\nThyrotropin alfa \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- If you experience any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Thyrogen is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Thyrogen \n\n3. How to use Thyrogen \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Thyrogen \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Thyrogen is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThyrogen contains the active substance thyrotropin alfa. Thyrogen is a human thyroid stimulating hormone \n\n(TSH) manufactured using biotechnology processes. \n\n \n\nThyrogen is used to detect certain types of thyroid cancer in patients who have had their thyroid gland removed \n\nand who are taking thyroid hormones. One of the effects is that it stimulates any remaining thyroid tissue to take \n\nup iodine which is important for radioiodine imaging. It also stimulates the production of thyroglobulin and \n\nthyroid hormones if there is any thyroid tissue left. These hormones can be measured in your blood. \n\n \n\nThyrogen is also used with radioiodine treatment to eliminate (ablate) the thyroid tissue left over after surgical \n\nremoval of the thyroid gland (remnant) in patients who do not have secondary cancer growths (metastases) and \n\nwho are taking thyroid hormone. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Thyrogen \n\n \n\nDo not use Thyrogen: \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic to bovine or human thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\u2022 if you are pregnant. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Thyrogen \n\n\u2022 if you have kidney disease that requires dialysis and he will decide how much Thyrogen to give to you \nas you may have more chance of experiencing headache and nausea. \n\n\u2022 if you have reduced kidney function and he will decide how much radioiodine to give you. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n\u2022 if you have reduced liver function; you should still be able to receive Thyrogen. \n \n\nEffect on tumour growth \n\nIn patients with thyroid cancer, tumour growth has been reported during withdrawal of thyroid hormones for \n\ndiagnostic procedures. This was thought to be related to the elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels \n\nover a longer period. It is possible that Thyrogen may also cause tumour growth. In clinical trials this was not \n\nseen. \n\n \n\nDue to elevation of TSH levels after Thyrogen, patients with secondary cancer growths (metastases) can \n\nexperience local swelling or bleeding at the site of these metastases which may become bigger. If the metastases \n\nare present in narrow spaces e.g. intracerebral (in the brain) or in the spinal cord, patients could experience \n\nsymptoms which can occur quickly such as partial paralysis affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis), \n\nbreathing problems or loss of vision.  \n\n \n\nYour doctor will decide if you belong to a specific group of patients for which pre-treatment with \n\ncorticosteroids is to be considered (for example, if you have secondary cancer growths in your brain or spinal \n\ncord). Please talk to your doctor about this if you have concerns. \n\n \n\nChildren  \n\nDue to a lack of data on the use of Thyrogen in children, Thyrogen should be given to children only in \n\nexceptional circumstances. \n\n \n\n Elderly  \n\nNo special precautions for elderly patients are necessary. However if your thyroid gland has not been removed \n\ncompletely and you are also suffering from heart disease, your doctor will help you decide if Thyrogen should \n\nbe given to you. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Thyrogen \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nThere are no known drug interactions with Thyrogen and the thyroid hormones you may be taking. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will determine the exact activity of radioiodine to use for radioiodine imaging, taking into \n\nconsideration the fact that you continue to take thyroid hormones.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nDo not take Thyrogen if you are pregnant. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or \n\nare planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nThyrogen should not be given to breast-feeding women. Breast-feeding should only be resumed following \n\nadvice from your doctor. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nSome patients may feel dizzy or have headaches after administration of Thyrogen which may affect the ability \n\nto drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nThyrogen contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n3. How to use Thyrogen \n \n\nYour medicine will be injected by a doctor or a nurse.  \n\n \n\nYour treatment should be supervised by a doctor who has expertise in thyroid cancer. Thyrogen powder must be \n\ndissolved in water for injection. Only one vial of Thyrogen is required per injection. Thyrogen should only be \n\nadministered into the buttock muscle. This solution should never be injected into a vein. Thyrogen must not be \n\nmixed with other medicines in the same injection.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Thyrogen is two doses administered 24 hours apart. Your doctor or nurse will inject \n\n1.0 ml of the Thyrogen solution. \n\n \n\nWhen you undergo radioiodine imaging or elimination (ablation), your doctor will give you radioiodine \n\n24 hours after your final Thyrogen injection.  \n\nDiagnostic scanning should be performed 48 to 72 hours after the radioiodine administration (72 to 96 hours \n\nafter the final injection of Thyrogen). \n\nPost-treatment scanning may be delayed a few days to allow background radioactivity to decline. \n\n \n\nFor thyroglobulin (Tg) testing, your doctor or nurse will take a serum sample 72 hours after the last injection of \n\nThyrogen. \n\nUse in children \n\nYour child\u2019s doctor will help you decide if Thyrogen should be given to your child. \n\n \n\nIf you are given more Thyrogen than you should receive \n\nPatients who accidentally received too much Thyrogen have reported nausea, weakness, dizziness, headache, \n\nvomiting and hot flashes.  \n\nA suggested treatment in case of overdose would be the reestablishment of fluid balance and administration of \n\nan antiemetic may also be considered. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n\n \n\nThe following effects have been reported with Thyrogen:  \n\n \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n\u2022 nausea \n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n\u2022 vomiting \n\n\u2022 fatigue \n\n\u2022 dizziness \n\n\u2022 headache \n\n\u2022 weakness \n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n\u2022 feeling hot \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\u2022 hives (urticaria) \n\n\u2022 rash \n\n\u2022 flu symptoms  \n\n\u2022 fever \n\n\u2022 chills \n\n\u2022 back pain \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\n\u2022 prickling or tingling sensation (paraesthesia),  \n\n\u2022 neck pain \n\n\u2022 inability to taste (ageusia) \n\n\u2022 impaired sense of taste (dysgeusia) \n\n\u2022 influenza \n \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n\n\u2022 swelling of the tumour  \n\n\u2022 pain (including pain at the site of metastases (secondary cancer growths))  \n\n\u2022 tremor \n\n\u2022 stroke \n\n\u2022 palpitations \n\n\u2022 flushing \n\n\u2022 shortness of breath  \n\n\u2022 itching (pruritus) \n\n\u2022 excessive sweating \n\n\u2022 muscle or joint pain \n\n\u2022 injection site reactions (including: redness, discomfort, itching, local pain or stinging, and an itchy rash) \n\n\u2022 low TSH \n\n\u2022 hypersensitivity (allergic reactions), these reactions include hives (urticaria), itching, flushing, difficulty \nin breathing and rash. \n\n \n\nVery rare cases of hyperthyroidism (increased activity of the thyroid gland) or atrial fibrillation have been \n\nreported when Thyrogen was administered to patients who had not undergone total or partial removal of the \n\nthyroid gland. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in \n\nthis leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

Swirl the contents of the vial gently until all \n\nmaterial is dissolved.  Do not shake the solution.  When the powder is dissolved the total volume in the vial is \n\n1.2 ml.  The pH of the Thyrogen solution is approximately 7.0. \n\n \n\nVisually inspect the Thyrogen solution in the vial for foreign particles and discoloration. The Thyrogen solution \n\nshould be a clear, colourless solution.  Do not use vials exhibiting foreign particles, cloudiness or discoloration. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n28 \n\nWithdraw 1.0 ml of the Thyrogen solution from the product vial. This equals 0.9 mg thyrotropin alfa to be \n\ninjected. \n\n \n\nThyrogen does not contain preservatives. Dispose of any unused solution immediately. No special requirements \n\nfor disposal. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution, the solution should be injected within three hours. The reconstituted solution can be \n\nstored for up to 24 hours in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C) under protection from light, while avoiding microbial \n\ncontamination. It is important to note that the microbiological safety depends on the aseptic conditions \n\nduring the preparation of the solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tANNEX 1 SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

stimulating hormone (tsh) manufactured using biotechnology processes. thyrogen is used to detect certain types of thyroid cancer in patients who have had their thyroid gland removed and who are taking thyroid hormones. one of the effects is that it stimulates any remaining thyroid tissue to take up iodine which is important for radioiodine imaging. it also stimulates the production of thyroglobulin and thyroid hormones if there is any thyroid tissue left. these hormones can be measured in your blood. thyrogen is also used with radioiodine treatment to eliminate (ablate) the thyroid tissue left over after surgical removal of the thyroid gland (remnant) in patients who do not have secondary cancer growths (metastases) and who are taking thyroid hormone.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

decide how much thyrogen to give to you as you may have more chance of experiencing headache and nausea. if you have reduced kidney function and he will decide how much radioiodine to give you. if you have reduced liver function; you should still be able to receive thyrogen. effect on tumour growth in patients with thyroid cancer, tumour growth has been reported during withdrawal of thyroid hormones for diagnostic procedures. this was thought to be related to the elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) levels over a longer period. it is possible that thyrogen may also cause tumour growth. in clinical trials this was not seen. due to elevation of tsh levels after thyrogen, patients with secondary cancer growths (metastases) can experience local swelling or bleeding at the site of these metastases which may become bigger. if the metastases are present in narrow spaces e.g. intracerebral (in the brain) or in the spinal cord, patients could experience symptoms which can occur quickly such as partial paralysis affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis), breathing problems or loss of vision. your doctor will decide if you belong to a specific group of patients for which pre-treatment with corticosteroids is to be considered (for example, if you have secondary cancer growths in your brain or spinal cord). please talk to your doctor about this if you have concerns. children due to a lack of data on the use of thyrogen in children, thyrogen should be given to children only in exceptional circumstances. elderly no special precautions for elderly patients are necessary. however if your thyroid gland has not been removed completely and you are also suffering from heart disease, your doctor will help you decide if thyrogen should be given to you. other medicines and thyrogen tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. there are no known drug interactions with thyrogen and the thyroid hormones you may be taking. your doctor will determine the exact activity of radioiodine to use for radioiodine imaging, taking into consideration the fact that you continue to take thyroid hormones. pregnancy and breast-feeding do not take thyrogen if you are pregnant. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. thyrogen should not be given to breast-feeding women. breast-feeding should only be resumed following advice from your doctor. driving and using machines some patients may feel dizzy or have headaches after administration of thyrogen which may affect the ability to drive and use machines. thyrogen contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "thyrogen", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "allergic", "Type":
