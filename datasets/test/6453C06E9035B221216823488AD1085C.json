This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDefitelio 80 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne mL of concentrate contains defibrotide* 80 mg corresponding to a quantity of 200 mg in 2.5 mL \nin a vial, and corresponding to a concentration in the range of 4 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL after dilution. \n* produced from porcine intestinal mucosa. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nThe solution is clear light yellow to brown, free from particulate matter or turbidity. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n \nDefitelio is indicated for the treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) also known as \nsinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) in haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) therapy. \n \nIt is indicated in adults and in adolescents, children and infants over 1 month of age. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDefitelio must be prescribed and administered to patients by specialised physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of complications of HSCT.  \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 6.25 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours (25 mg/kg/day). \n \nThere is limited efficacy and safety data on doses above this level and consequently it is not \nrecommended to increase the dose above 25 mg/kg/day. \n \nThe treatment should be administered for a minimum of 21 days and continued until the symptoms \nand signs of severe VOD resolve. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDose adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment or who are on intermittent \nhaemodialysis (see section 5.2).  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo formal pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment; \nhowever, the medicinal product has been used in clinical trials of patients developing hepatic \nimpairment without dose adjustment with no safety issues identified. No dose adjustment is therefore \nrecommended but careful monitoring of patients should be undertaken (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe recommended dose for children aged 1 month to 18 years is the same mg/kg dose as for adults i.e. \n6.25 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of defibrotide in children aged less than 1 month has not yet been established. \nNo data are available. The use of Defitelio in children aged less than one month is not recommended. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nDefitelio is for intravenous use. It is administered by intravenous infusion, over two hours. \n \nDefitelio should always be diluted prior to use. It can be diluted with 5% glucose solution for infusion \nor sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion, to a suitable concentration to permit \ninfusion over 2 hours. The total volume of infusion should be determined based on the individual\u2019s \npatient weight. The final concentration of Defitelio should be in the range of 4 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL. \n \nVials are intended for a single use and unused solution from a single dose must be discarded (see \nsection 6.6) \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2212 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\u2212 Concomitant use of thrombolytic therapy (e.g. t-PA) (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. \n \nUse of medicinal products that increase the risk of haemorrhage within 24 hours of Defitelio \nadministration (within 12 hours in the case of unfractionated heparin) is not recommended. \n \nConcomitant systemic anticoagulant therapy (e.g. heparin, warfarin, direct thrombin inhibitors and \ndirect factor Xa inhibitors) (see section 4.5), except for routine maintenance or reopening of central \nvenous line, requires careful monitoring. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of Defitelio \nduring use of such therapy.  \n \nMedicinal products that affect platelet aggregation (e.g. non\u2013steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) \nshould be administered with care, under close medical supervision, during Defitelio administration. \n \nIn patients who have or develop clinically significant acute bleeding requiring blood transfusion, \nDefitelio is not recommended or should be discontinued. Temporary discontinuation of Defitelio is \nrecommended in patients who undergo surgery or invasive procedures at significant risk of major \nbleeding. \n \n\n\n\n \n\nAdministration of defibrotide to patients who have haemodynamic instability, defined as inability to \nmaintain mean arterial pressure with single pressor support, is not recommended. \n \nA bolus administration of Defitelio may cause flushing or a sensation of \u201cgeneralised heat\u201d. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPotential interactions with recombinant t-PA \n \nIn a mouse model of thromboembolism, recombinant t-PA potentiated the antithrombotic effect of \ndefibrotide when given intravenously and thus co-administration may present an increased risk of \nhaemorrhage and is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  \n \nPotential interactions with antithrombotic fibrinolytic agents \n \nDefibrotide has a profibrinolytic effect (see section 5.1) and this may potentially enhance the activity \nof antithrombotic/fibrinolytic medicinal products. \n \nThere is currently no reported experience in patients on the concomitant treatment with Low \nMolecular Weight Heparins (LMWHs), warfarin or the concomitant treatment with direct thrombin \ninhibitors (e.g., dabigatran) or direct Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban and apixaban). Therefore, \nthe use of defibrotide with antithrombotic/fibrinolytic medicinal products is not recommended.  \nHowever, if used, in exceptional cases, caution should be exercised by closely monitoring the \ncoagulation parameters (see section 4.4). \n \nPotential interactions with other medicinal products \n \nDefibrotide does not inhibit or induce CYP450s (see section 5.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nEffective contraception is required for patients and partners of patients during exposure to Defitelio \nand for one week subsequent to discontinuation.  \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no studies using defibrotide in pregnant women. Embryo-foetal developmental toxicology \nstudies in pregnant rats and rabbits of defibrotide doses close to the recommended therapeutic human \ndose, revealed a high rate of haemorrhagic abortion (see section 5.3). \n \nDefitelio should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with Defitelio. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether defibrotide is excreted in human milk. Considering the nature of the medicinal \nproduct, a risk to the newborns/infants is not expected. Defitelio may be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no studies investigating the effects of defibrotide on human fertility.  \n\n\n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDefitelio  has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and operate machines. However, \npatients would not be expected to drive or operate machinery due to the nature of the underlying \ndisease.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the Safety Profile \n \nIn the Phase 3 pivotal treatment study (2005-01 Study), the overall incidence of adverse events was \nsimilar in the defibrotide treatment group and in the control group (historical). The tabulated list of \nadverse reactions incorporates the ADRs observed in study 2005-01 [ADR = any event reported as \npossibly related on at least two occasions] and TEAEs observed in T-IND 2006-05 study [TEAE = \nany AE that started or worsened in severity after the first dose of defibrotide]. For adverse reactions \nreported in both studies, the highest frequency was used in the table below. The safety data from the \npivotal study are supported and confirmed with data from the completed Treatment-IND study. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions observed during the treatment of hepatic VOD are haemorrhage \n(including but not limited to gastrointestinal haemorrhage, pulmonary haemorrhage and epistaxis) and \nhypotension.  \n \nIn addition, although in the defibrotide studies in VOD there have been no reports of hypersensitivity, \ncases of hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis were reported from a previously marketed formulation \nof defibrotide, consequently hypersensitivity is included as an ADR.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions observed are listed below, by system organ class and frequency. Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies \nare defined as: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), \nrare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders   \nCommon Coagulopathy \nImmune system disorders  \nUncommon Hypersensitivity \n Anaphylactic reaction \nNervous system disorders \nCommon Cerebral haemorrhage   \nUncommon Cerebral haematoma   \nEye disorders \nUncommon Conjunctival haemorrhage \nVascular disorders \nVery common Hypotension \nCommon Haemorrhage  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon Pulmonary haemorrhage \n Epistaxis   \nUncommon Haemothorax \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nCommon Gastrointestinal haemorrhage \n Vomiting  \n Diarrhoea \n\n\n\n \n\n Nausea \n Haematemesis \n Mouth haemorrhage   \nUncommon Melaena \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon Rash \n Pruritus \n Petechiae \nUncommon Ecchymosis \nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon Haematuria   \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon Catheter site haemorrhage \n Pyrexia   \nUncommon Injection site haemorrhage   \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nIn the treatment studies over 50% of the patients were children. In doses above the recommended dose \nof 25 mg/kg/day there was a higher proportion of patients with bleeding events in the high dose group \nbut since many events occurred in the follow-up period, a clear relationship with defibrotide treatment \ncould not be determined. In the paediatric prevention study at 25 mg/kg/day there was an increased \nincidence of any bleeding events in the defibrotide group compared with the treatment group.  \n \nHowever there was no difference in incidence of serious bleeding or bleeding events with fatal \noutcome. \n \nThe frequency nature and severity of adverse reactions in children are otherwise the same as in adults. \nNo special precautions are indicated. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorization of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose and treatment should be symptomatic. Defibrotide is not \nremoved by dialysis (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: other antithrombotic agents; ATC code: B01AX01. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDefibrotide is an oligonucleotide mixture with demonstrated antithrombotic, fibrinolytic, anti-adhesive \nand anti-inflammatory actions. The mechanism of action is multifactorial. It primarily acts through \nreducing excessive endothelial cell (EC) activation (endothelial dysfunction), modulating endothelial \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\nhomeostasis as well as restoring thrombo-fibrinolytic balance. However, the exact mechanism of \naction of defibrotide is not fully elucidated. \n \nDefibrotide has  demonstrated antithrombotic and fibrinolytic effects in vitro and in vivo by: \nincreasing systemic tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and \nthrombomodulin (TM) expression; decreasing von Willebrand factor (vWF) and  plasminogen \nactivator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression;  and enhancing the enzymatic activity of plasmin to \nhydrolyse fibrin clots.  \n \nIn vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that defibrotide inhibits leukocyte and platelet adhesion \nto endothelium by: suppressing P-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM)-1; \ninterfering with lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1-intercell adhesion molecule (LFA-1-ICAM) \nmediated leukocyte transmigration; and increasing nitric oxide (NO), Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) and \nProstaglandin E2 (PGE2).  \n \nIn vitro defibrotide demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects that attenuate the release and production of \nreactive oxygen species and inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 6, thromboxane A2, \nleukotriene B4 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). \n \nDefibrotide protects ECs from damage and promotes tissue homeostasis by decreasing \nfludarabine-mediated apoptosis of EC while maintaining its anti-leukemic effect and by inhibiting the \nexpression of heparanase, shown in in vitro and in vivo  studies respectively. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of defibrotide in the treatment of severe VOD were studied in a pivotal Phase \n3 historical-controlled study (2005-01). Forty-four children and 58 adult patients with severe VOD \npost-HSCT, were treated with Defitelio 25 mg/kg/day intravenous by infusion, and compared with \n32 historical control patients. Median length of therapy in those treated with Defitelio was 22 days.   \n \nA significantly higher proportion of patients in the Defitelio treated group achieved a complete \nresponse defined as total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dL and resolution of MOF (multiple organ failure); \nDay+100 complete response was 23.5% (24/102) with Defitelio versus 9.4% (3/32) in the historical \ncontrol (p=0.013). In addition, Day+100 survival rate was improved in the Defitelio group with 38.2% \n(39/102) of the patients surviving versus 25.0% (8/32) in the historical control group (p=0.034).  \n\nThe efficacy data from this pivotal study are supported and confirmed with data from a dose-finding \nstudy (25 mg/kg arm) and the Open Label Treatment-IND study, as presented in Tables 1. \n \nTable 1: Treatment Study Results: Complete Response and Survival Rate of Severe VOD at \nDay+100  \n\n \n\nIndividual Studies \n\nDose-Finding \n(25mg/kg/day arm) \n\nOpen Label \nTreatment IND \n(25mg/kg/day) \n\nHistorically Controlled Trial \n(25mg/kg/day) \n\nDefibrotide \ntreated group \n\nHistorical \nControl \n\nComplete \nResponse by \n\nDay+100 \n \n\n43% \n(32/75) \n\n39.3% \n(201/512) \n\n23.5% \n(24/102) \n\n9.4% \n(3/32) \n\np= 0.0131 \nSurvival by \nDay+100 43.9%* 49.5%* \n\n38.2%* 25.0%* \np=0.0341 \n\n*=Kaplan Meier estimates for time-to-event analysis by Day100 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nOutcome data available from 611 patients treated with Defitelio on a compassionate use basis for \nnon-severe and severe VOD post-transplant, are consistent with the controlled clinical trials, with \ncomplete response rate 24% (51/212) and survival 37% (78/212) in the subset of patients with severe \nVOD. \n \nA controlled randomised prophylaxis study (Study 2004-000592-33) was conducted in the paediatric \npatients undergoing HSCT. Patients (n=356) were randomised to receive 25 mg/kg/day from the start \nof conditioning or were randomised to receive no prophylaxis. \n \nA 40% reduction in the overall incidence of VOD in the Defitelio prophylaxis arm (from 19.9% in the \ncontrol arm to 12.2% in the Defitelio arm), has been shown. The use of Defitelio rescue treatment for \nall patients who developed VOD meant that the study was not designed to assess any survival \nadvantage and none was seen in this study.  \n \nIn secondary analyses on the subset of patients undergoing allogeneic transplants, Defitelio \nprophylaxis was also associated with a lower incidence and less Grade 2 to 4 severity of acute graft \nversus host disease (aGvHD) by Day+100. \n \nCoppell et al in 2010 reported data from a large meta-analysis of 235 patients with severe VOD \nshowing a background mortality rate of severe VOD of 84.3% and that this mortality rate has \nremained constant over several decades.  \n \nData derived from an independent US registry have shown a beneficial effect of Defitelio in routine \nclinical practice. At an interim analysis of the on-going registry, data from 96 patients with severe \nVOD were available. \n \nThe Day+100 all-cause mortality in patients with severe VOD who were not treated with defibrotide \nwas 69%, and 61% in those patients who received defibrotide. These data are from an open label \nregistry and the subjects were not randomised. \n \nAdditional information is shown in the following Table 2. \n \nTable 2: US Registry data \n\n \n\nNon-defibrotide treated  Defibrotide treated \n55 41 \n\nAlive at Day +100 17 (31%) 16 (39%) \nVOD resolved by Day +100 16 (29%) 21 (51%) \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn each of the clinical trials performed in the treatment of VOD, over 50% of patients were under the \nage of 18 years. Safety information in children are available from the prevention study conducted \nsolely in children. Safety and efficacy in children aged less than 1 month have not yet been \nestablished. \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \n \nBased on the results of the QTc study, conducted in healthy subjects at therapeutic and \nsupra-therapeutic doses, it can be concluded that Defitelio has no significant or clinically relevant \nQTc-prolonging potential at doses up to 4 times higher than therapeutically indicated. Defitelio might \nbe considered free of proarrhythmic toxicity related to QT changes. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease and for ethical reasons preventing to perform a placebo-controlled study, it has \nnot been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. \n\n\n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and Distribution \n \nIn 52 healthy volunteers, after a single 6.25 mg/kg dose of Defitelio given as a 2-hour infusion, the \npharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: \n \nTable 3. Defitelio pharmacokinetic parameters after intravenous infusion of 6.25 mg/kg to \nhealthy subjects. \n\nParameter Defitelio PK Parameters \nMean \u00b1 SD \n\nCmax (\u00b5g/mL) 17.3 \u00b1 3.83 \ntmax (h)# 2.00 (1.00-2.00) \n\nAUCt (\u00b5g/mL*h) 26.9 \u00b1 8.53 \nAUC (\u00b5g/mL*h) 48.1 \u00b1 6.49 \n\nVd (mL) 9934 \u00b1 3807 \nCL (L/h) 10.4 \u00b1 1.77 \nKel (1/h) 1.25 \u00b1 0.66 \n\nt1/2 (h) 0.71 \u00b1 0.35 \n# median (min-max) \n\n \nMaximum plasma concentrations peaked at the end of the infusion period and declined thereafter with \na rapid clearance and most of samples were undetectable 3.5 hours after the start of the infusion. \nPharmacokinetic modelling simulation analysis showed that Defitelio plasma concentrations do not \naccumulate upon multiple dose administration and with doses up to 4-fold the therapeutic dose. \nVolume of distribution is around 10 L. In vitro studies demonstrate that 93% of Defitelio is bound to \nplasma proteins. \n \nElimination \n \nAfter administration of the therapeutic dose (6.25 mg/kg) to healthy subjects, an average of 9.48% of \nthe total dose administered is excreted in urine as unchanged defibrotide in 24 hours, with the majority \nexcreted during the first collection interval of 0-4 hours (approximately 98%). \n \nMetabolism \n \nDefibrotide does not inhibit or induce CYP450s. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nSix patients with an estimated  glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73m2 (calculated using the \nModification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) and not currently on dialysis were compared to 6 \nhealthy subjects with similar baseline demographics. Defitelio 6.25 mg/kg was administered \nintravenously over 2 hours to subjects every 6 hours. Compared to healthy controls, subjects with \nrenal impairment demonstrated 1.6\u2013 and 1.4-fold increases in AUC and Cmax, respectively and a \nhalf-life of about twice that of healthy subjects. \n \nThe amount of defibrotide excreted in urine over 24 hrs was about 5% of the total dose administered \nin those with renal impairment versus about 12% in healthy subjects. \n \n\n\n\n \n\nAlmost all renal excretion occurs within the first 4 hours. Accumulation of defibrotide over 4 doses \nwas not found. Difference in exposure is not considered clinically relevant and so dose adjustment is   \nnot advised for patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nIn a sub-study it was shown that haemodialysis did not remove defibrotide (see section 4.2) \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo formal pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in hepatic impaired patients. Defitelio has \nbeen used in clinical trials in patients with hepatic impairment without dose adjustment with no major \nsafety issues identified (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity.  \n \nIn both species, the main findings were accumulation of vacuolated macrophages in liver of dogs and \nin liver, kidneys and lymph nodes of rats. Macrophages are considered the main target organ. \n \nEmbryo-foetal development  \n \nIn the Segment II reproductive studies in rats and rabbits, defibrotide has shown maternal toxicity by \ninducing a high rate of haemorrhagic abortion when infused intravenously over two hours at all dose \nlevels tested including doses close to the human dose. Due to this maternal toxicity, no conclusion can \nbe drawn regarding the effects of defibrotide on embryo-foetal development. PAI-2 is known to be \nuniquely up-regulated in the placenta.  \n \nJuvenile toxicity \n \nRepeated intravenous administration of defibrotide, at doses below and close to the human therapeutic \ndose, to juvenile rats resulted in a delay in the mean age of preputial separation, suggesting a delay in \nthe onset of male puberty in rats. However, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nSodium citrate, dihydrate  \nHydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) \nSodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vials \n3 years  \n \nIn-use stability after first opening and/or dilution \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, after dilution, the reconstituted medicinal product should be \nused immediately. However, chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for \n72 hours at 15-25\u00b0C for a concentration range of 4 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for infusion or 5% glucose solution for infusion at 15-25\u00baC for 72 hours. \n \nIf not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \nuser and would not normally be expected to exceed 24 hours at 2-8\u00b0C. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \nDo not freeze. \n \nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n2.5 mL vials (Type I clear glass), closed with a stopper (butyl rubber) and seal (aluminium). \n \nPack size of 10 vials. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nDefitelio is for single use only. \n \nThe concentrate solution for infusion has to be diluted using aseptic technique. \n \nDefitelio should be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or 5% glucose \nsolution for infusion (see section 6.3 for concentration range and stability of the diluted solution) to a \nsuitable concentration to permit 2 hours infusion time (see section 4.2). \n \nPreparation of Defitelio (use aseptic technique): \n \n1. The number of vials to be diluted should be determined based on the individual patient's weight \n(see section 4.2). \n2. Before dilution, each vial should be inspected for particles. If particles are observed and/or the \nliquid in the vial is not clear, the vial must not be used. \n3. The total volume of infusion should be determined based on the individual patient's weight. The \nfinal concentration of Defitelio should be in the concentration range of 4 mg/mL \u2013 20 mg/mL (see \nsection 6.3). \n4. A volume of the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or glucose 5% solution \nfor infusion from the infusion bag should be withdrawn and discarded, equal to the total volume of \nDefitelio solution to be added. \n5. The required volume from the Defitelio vials should be withdrawn and combined. \n6. The combined volumes of Defitelio should be added to the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution for infusion or glucose 5% solution for infusion. \n7. The solution for infusion should be mixed gently. \n8. Prior to use the solution should be visually inspected for particulate matter. Only clear solutions \nwithout visible particles should be used. Depending on the type and amount of diluent the colour of \nthe diluted solution may vary from colourless to light yellow. It is recommended that the diluted \nDefitelio solution be administered to patients using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 \u03bcm in-line \nfilter. \n9. After the infusion is complete, the intravenous line should be flushed with sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion or glucose 5% solution for infusion. \n \n\n\n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

Contents of the pack and other information. \n \n \n1. What Defitelio is and what it is used for \n \nDefitelio is a medicine that contains the active substance defibrotide.  \n \nIt is used to treat a condition called hepatic veno-occlusive disease, in which the blood vessels in the \nliver become damaged and obstructed by blood clots. This can be caused by medicines that are given  \nprior to a stem cell transplantation. \n \nDefibrotide works by protecting the cells of the blood vessels and preventing or breaking down the \nblood clots.  \n \nThis medicine can be used in adults, and in adolescents, children and infants over one month of age. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Defitelio  \n \nDo not use Defitelio \n\u2022 if you are allergic to defibrotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n\u2022 if you are using other medicines to break down blood clots such as tissue plasminogen activator  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Defitelio: \n\u2022 if you are taking medicine that increases the risk of bleeding \n\u2022 if you have heavy bleeding and need a blood transfusion \n\u2022 if you are undergoing surgery \n\u2022 if you have problems with blood circulation because your body cannot maintain a constant \n\nblood pressure. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n\n\n \n\nDefitelio is not recommended in children less than 1 month of age. \n \nOther medicines and Defitelio \nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines to prevent blood clotting such as acetylsalicylic acid, \nheparins, warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban or if you are taking anti-inflammatory \nmedicines (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Defitelio if you are pregnant unless your disease requires treatment with Defitelio. \nIf you are sexually active and you or your partner could become pregnant, you both must use effective \ncontraception during treatment with Defitelio and for 1 week after stopping the treatment.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not expected that Defitelio will affect your ability to drive and operate machines. \n \nDefitelio contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 23 mg of sodium, which means it is essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How you will be given Defitelio  \n \nThe treatment with Defitelio can be initiated and continuously supervised only by an experienced \ndoctor in a hospital or in a specialised centre for stem cells transplantation. \n \nIt will be slowly injected (over a 2-hour period) into one of your veins. This is called an \u2018intravenous \ninfusion\u2019 or drip. \n \nYou will receive this treatment four times a day for at least 21 days or until your symptoms resolve. \nThe recommended dose in children from one month to 18 years of age is the same as in adults. \n \nIf a dose of Defitelio has been forgotten \nAs you will be given this medicine by a doctor or a nurse it is unlikely that a dose will be missed. \nHowever, tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you think that a dose has been forgotten. You \nmust not be given a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Defitelio can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  For patients \ntreated with Defitelio the following side effects were reported. \n \nIf you experience any of these side effects, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n\nVery Common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people ) \n\n\u2022 low blood pressure  \n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 bleeding in general \n\u2022 bleeding from the nose \n\u2022 bleeding in the brain \n\u2022 bleeding in the gut \n\u2022 vomiting blood \n\u2022 bleeding in the lungs \n\n\n\n \n\n\u2022 bleeding from the infusion line \n\u2022 blood in the urine \n\u2022 bleeding from the mouth \n\u2022 bleeding into the skin \n\u2022 coagulopathy (disturbance of blood clotting) \n\u2022 nausea \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 rash \n\u2022 itching \n\u2022 fever \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 bleeding from the eye \n\u2022 blood in the stool \n\u2022 bleeding at the site of injection \n\u2022 localized blood collection out of the vessel (hematoma) in the brain \n\u2022 haemothorax (accumulation of blood in the area between the heart and the lung) \n\u2022 bruising \n\u2022 severe allergic reaction (you might experience swelling of the hands, face, lips, tongue or throat, \n\ndifficulty in breathing). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nSide effects in children (1 month to 18 years old) are expected to be similar in type, severity and \nfrequency and no other special precautions are needed. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.
