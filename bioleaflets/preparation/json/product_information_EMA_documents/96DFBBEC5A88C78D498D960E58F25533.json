CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSPRYCEL is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: \n newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukaemia \n\n(CML) in the chronic phase.  \n chronic, accelerated or blast phase CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including \n\nimatinib. \n Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoid blast CML with resistance or intolerance \n\nto prior therapy. \n \nSPRYCEL is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients with: \n newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) or Ph+ CML-CP resistant or \n\nintolerant to prior therapy including imatinib. \n newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with \nleukaemia. \n \nPosology \nAdult patients \nThe recommended starting dose for chronic phase CML is 100 mg dasatinib once daily. \n \nThe recommended starting dose for accelerated, myeloid or lymphoid blast phase (advanced phase) \nCML or Ph+ ALL is 140 mg once daily (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population (Ph+ CML-CP and Ph+ ALL) \nDosing for children and adolescents is on the basis of body weight (see Table 1). Dasatinib is \nadministered orally once daily in the form of either SPRYCEL film-coated tablets or SPRYCEL \n\n\n\n 4\n\npowder for oral suspension (see Summary of Product Characteristics for SPRYCEL powder for oral \nsuspension). The dose should be recalculated every 3 months based on changes in body weight, or \nmore often if necessary. The tablet is not recommended for patients weighing less than 10 kg; the \npowder for oral suspension should be used for these patients. Dose increase or reduction is \nrecommended based on individual patient response and tolerability. There is no experience with \nSPRYCEL treatment in children under 1 year of age. \n \nSPRYCEL film-coated tablets and SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension are not bioequivalent. \nPatients who are able to swallow tablets and who desire to switch from SPRYCEL powder for oral \nsuspension to SPRYCEL tablets or patients who are not able to swallow tablets and who desire to \nswitch from tablets to oral suspension, may do so, provided that the correct dosing recommendations \nfor the dosage form are followed. \n \nThe recommended starting daily dosage of SPRYCEL tablets in paediatric patients is shown in \nTable 1. \n \nTable 1: Dosage of SPRYCEL tablets for paediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP or Ph+ ALL \n\nBody weight (kg)a Daily dose (mg) \n10 to less than 20 kg 40 mg \n20 to less than 30 kg 60 mg \n30 to less than 45 kg 70 mg \n\nat least 45 kg 100 mg \na The tablet is not recommended for patients weighing less than 10 kg; the powder for oral suspension should be used for \n\nthese patients. \n \nTreatment duration \nIn clinical studies, treatment with SPRYCEL in adults with Ph+ CML-CP, accelerated, myeloid or \nlymphoid blast phase (advanced phase) CML, or Ph+ ALL and paediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP \nwas continued until disease progression or until no longer tolerated by the patient. The effect of \nstopping treatment on long-term disease outcome after the achievement of a cytogenetic or molecular \nresponse [including complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR) and \nMR4.5] has not been investigated. \n \nIn clinical studies, treatment with SPRYCEL in paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL was administered \ncontinuously, added to successive blocks of backbone chemotherapy, for a maximum duration of two \nyears. In patients that receive a subsequent stem cell transplantation, SPRYCEL can be administered \nfor an additional year post-transplantation. \n \nTo achieve the recommended dose, SPRYCEL is available as 20 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg \nand 140 mg film-coated tablets and powder for oral suspension (10 mg/mL suspension upon \nconstitution). Dose increase or reduction is recommended based on patient response and tolerability. \n \nDose escalation \nIn clinical studies in adult CML and Ph+ ALL patients, dose escalation to 140 mg once daily (chronic \nphase CML) or 180 mg once daily (advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL) was allowed in patients who \ndid not achieve a haematologic or cytogenetic response at the recommended starting dose. \n \nThe following dose escalations shown in Table 2 are recommended in paediatric patients with \nPh+ CML-CP who do not achieve a haematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response at the \nrecommended time points, per current treatment guidelines, and who tolerate the treatment.  \n \n\n\n\n 5\n\nTable 2: Dose escalation for paediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP \n Dose (maximum dose per day) \n Starting dose Escalation \n\nTablets 40 mg 50 mg \n 60 mg 70 mg \n 70 mg 90 mg \n 100 mg 120 mg \n\n \nDose escalation is not recommended for paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL, as SPRYCEL is \nadministered in combination with chemotherapy in these patients. \n \nDose adjustment for adverse reactions \nMyelosuppression \nIn clinical studies, myelosuppression was managed by dose interruption, dose reduction, or \ndiscontinuation of study therapy. Platelet transfusion and red cell transfusion were used as appropriate. \nHaematopoietic growth factor has been used in patients with resistant myelosuppression. \nGuidelines for dose modifications in adults are summarised in Table 3 and in paediatric patients with \nPh+ CML-CP in Table 4. Guidelines for paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL treated in combination with \nchemotherapy are in a separate paragraph following the tables. \n \nTable 3: Dose adjustments for neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia in adults \n\nAdults with chronic phase \nCML \n(starting dose 100 mg once \ndaily) \n\nANC < 0.5 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 50 x 109/L \n\n1 Stop treatment until ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L and \nplatelets ≥ 50 x 109/L. \n\n \n2 Resume treatment at the original starting \n\ndose. \n \n3 If platelets < 25 x 109/L and/or recurrence of \n\nANC < 0.5 x 109/L for > 7 days, repeat step \n1 and resume treatment at a reduced dose of \n80 mg once daily for second episode. For \nthird episode, further reduce dose to 50 mg \nonce daily (for newly diagnosed patients) or \ndiscontinue (for patients resistant or \nintolerant to prior therapy including \nimatinib). \n\n \n\nAdults with accelerated \nand blast phase CML and \nPh+ ALL \n(starting dose 140 mg once \ndaily) \n\nANC < 0.5 x 109/L \nand/or \nplatelets < 10 x 109/L \n\n1 Check if cytopaenia is related to leukaemia \n(marrow aspirate or biopsy). \n\n \n2 If cytopaenia is unrelated to leukaemia, stop \n\ntreatment until ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L and \nplatelets ≥ 20 x 109/L and resume at the \noriginal starting dose. \n\n \n3 If recurrence of cytopaenia, repeat step 1 and \n\nresume treatment at a reduced dose of \n100 mg once daily (second episode) or \n80 mg once daily (third episode). \n\n \n4 If cytopaenia is related to leukaemia, \n\nconsider dose escalation to 180 mg once \ndaily. \n\n \nANC: absolute neutrophil count \n \n\n\n\n 6\n\nTable 4: Dose adjustments for neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia in paediatric patients \nwith Ph+ CML-CP \n\n1. If cytopaenia persists for \nmore than 3 weeks, check if \ncytopaenia is related to \nleukaemia (marrow aspirate \nor biopsy). \n \n2. If cytopaenia is unrelated \nto leukaemia, stop treatment \nuntil ANC ≥1.0 × 109/L and \nplatelets ≥75 × 109/L and \nresume at the original \nstarting dose or at a reduced \ndose. \n \n3. If cytopaenia recurs, \nrepeat marrow \naspirate/biopsy and resume \ntreatment at a reduced dose. \n\n Dose (maximum dose per day) \n Original \n\nstarting dose \nOne-level dose \n\nreduction \nTwo-level dose \n\nreduction \nTablets 40 mg 20 mg * \n\n 60 mg 40 mg 20 mg \n 70 mg 60 mg 50 mg \n 100 mg 80 mg 70 mg \n\nANC: absolute neutrophil count \n*lower tablet dose not available \n \nFor paediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP, if Grade ≥3 neutropaenia or thrombocytopaenia recurs \nduring complete haematologic response (CHR), SPRYCEL should be interrupted, and may be \nsubsequently resumed at a reduced dose. Temporary dose reductions for intermediate degrees of \ncytopaenia and disease response should be implemented as needed. \n \nFor paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL, no dose modification is recommended in cases of haematologic \nGrade 1 to 4 toxicities. If neutropaenia and/or thrombocytopaenia result in delay of the next block of \ntreatment by more than 14 days, SPRYCEL should be interrupted and resumed at the same dose level \nonce the next block of treatment is started. If neutropaenia and/or thrombocytopaenia persist and the \nnext block of treatment is delayed another 7 days, a bone marrow assessment should be performed to \nassess cellularity and percentage of blasts. If marrow cellularity is <10%, treatment with SPRYCEL \nshould be interrupted until ANC >500/μL (0.5 x 109/L), at which time treatment may be resumed at \nfull dose. If marrow cellularity is >10%, resumption of treatment with SPRYCEL may be considered. \n \nNon-haematologic adverse reactions \nIf a moderate, grade 2, non-haematologic adverse reaction develops with dasatinib, treatment should \nbe interrupted until the adverse reaction has resolved or returned to baseline. The same dose should be \nresumed if this is the first occurrence and the dose should be reduced if this is a recurrent adverse \nreaction. If a severe grade 3 or 4, non-haematologic adverse reaction develops with dasatinib, \ntreatment must be withheld until the adverse reaction has resolved. Thereafter, treatment can be \nresumed as appropriate at a reduced dose depending on the initial severity of the adverse reaction. For \npatients with chronic phase CML who received 100 mg once daily, dose reduction to 80 mg once daily \nwith further reduction from 80 mg once daily to 50 mg once daily, if needed, is recommended. For \npatients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL who received 140 mg once daily, dose reduction to \n100 mg once daily with further reduction from 100 mg once daily to 50 mg once daily, if needed, is \nrecommended. In CML-CP paediatric patients with non-haematologic adverse reactions, the dose \nreduction recommendations for haematologic adverse reactions that are described above should be \nfollowed. In Ph+ ALL paediatric patients with non-haematologic adverse reactions, if needed, one \nlevel of dose reduction should be followed, according to the dose reduction recommendations for \nhaematologic adverse reactions that are described above. \n \nPleural effusion \nIf a pleural effusion is diagnosed, dasatinib should be interrupted until patient is examined, \nasymptomatic or has returned to baseline. If the episode does not improve within approximately one \nweek, a course of diuretics or corticosteroids or both concurrently should be considered (see \n\n\n\n 7\n\nsections 4.4 and 4.8). Following resolution of the first episode, reintroduction of dasatinib at the same \ndose level should be considered. Following resolution of a subsequent episode, dasatinib at one dose \nlevel reduction should be reintroduced. Following resolution of a severe (grade 3 or 4) episode, \ntreatment can be resumed as appropriate at a reduced dose depending on the initial severity of the \nadverse reaction. \n \nDose reduction for concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \nThe concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and grapefruit juice with SPRYCEL should be \navoided (see section 4.5). If possible, an alternative concomitant medication with no or minimal \nenzyme inhibition potential should be selected. If SPRYCEL must be administered with a strong \nCYP3A4 inhibitor, consider a dose decrease to:  \n\n 40 mg daily for patients taking SPRYCEL 140 mg tablet daily. \n 20 mg daily for patients taking SPRYCEL 100 mg tablet daily. \n 20 mg daily for patients taking SPRYCEL 70 mg tablet daily. \n\n \nFor patients taking SPRYCEL 60 mg or 40 mg daily, consider interrupting the dose of SPRYCEL \nuntil the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, or switching to a lower dose with the powder for oral \nsuspension formulation (see Summary of Product Characteristics for SPRYCEL powder for oral \nsuspension). Allow a washout period of approximately 1 week after the inhibitor is stopped before \nreinitiating SPRYCEL.  \n \nThese reduced doses of SPRYCEL are predicted to adjust the area under the curve (AUC) to the range \nobserved without CYP3A4 inhibitors; however, clinical data are not available with these dose \nadjustments in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If SPRYCEL is not tolerated after dose \nreduction, either discontinue the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or interrupt SPRYCEL until the inhibitor is \ndiscontinued. Allow a washout period of approximately 1 week after the inhibitor is stopped before the \nSPRYCEL dose is increased. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nNo clinically relevant age-related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in these patients. \nNo specific dose recommendation is necessary in elderly. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPatients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting \ndose. However, SPRYCEL should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinical studies were conducted with SPRYCEL in patients with decreased renal function (the \nstudy in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML excluded patients with serum creatinine \nconcentration > 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, and studies in patients with chronic phase \nCML with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy excluded patients with serum creatinine \nconcentration > 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range). Since the renal clearance of dasatinib \nand its metabolites is < 4%, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal \ninsufficiency. \n \nMethod of administration \nSPRYCEL must be administered orally. \nThe film-coated tablets must not be crushed, cut or chewed in order to maintain dosing consistency \nand minimise the risk of dermal exposure; they must be swallowed whole. Film-coated tablets should \nnot be dispersed as the exposure in patients receiving a dispersed tablet is lower than in those \nswallowing a whole tablet. SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension is also available for paediatric \nPh+ CML-CP and Ph+ ALL patients, and adult CML-CP patients, who cannot swallow tablets.  \nSPRYCEL can be taken with or without a meal and should be taken consistently either in the morning \nor in the evening (see section 5.2). SPRYCEL should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice \n(see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 8\n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinically relevant interactions \nDasatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Therefore, there is a \npotential for interaction with other concomitantly administered medicinal products that are \nmetabolised primarily by or modulate the activity of CYP3A4 (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products or substances that potently inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g. \nketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, telithromycin, grapefruit juice) \nmay increase exposure to dasatinib. Therefore, in patients receiving dasatinib, coadministration of a \npotent CYP3A4 inhibitor is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. dexamethasone, \nphenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or herbal preparations containing Hypericum \nperforatum, also known as St. John's Wort) may substantially reduce exposure to dasatinib, potentially \nincreasing the risk of therapeutic failure. Therefore, in patients receiving dasatinib, coadministration of \nalternative medicinal products with less potential for CYP3A4 induction should be selected (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of dasatinib and a CYP3A4 substrate may increase exposure to the CYP3A4 \nsubstrate. Therefore, caution is warranted when dasatinib is coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates \nof narrow therapeutic index, such as astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil \nor ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) (see section 4.5). \n \nThe concomitant use of dasatinib and a histamine-2 (H2) antagonist (e.g. famotidine), proton pump \ninhibitor (e.g. omeprazole), or aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide may reduce the exposure \nto dasatinib. Thus, H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are not recommended and aluminium \nhydroxide/magnesium hydroxide products should be administered up to 2 hours prior to, or 2 hours \nfollowing the administration of dasatinib (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \nBased on the findings from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study, patients with mild, moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting dose (see section 5.2). Due to the \nlimitations of this clinical study, caution is recommended when administering dasatinib to patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nImportant adverse reactions \nMyelosuppression \nTreatment with dasatinib is associated with anaemia, neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia. Their \noccurrence is earlier and more frequent in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in \nchronic phase CML. In adult patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL treated with dasatinib as \nmonotherapy, complete blood counts (CBCs) should be performed weekly for the first 2 months, and \nthen monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. In adult and paediatric patients with chronic phase \nCML, complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, then every 3 months \nthereafter or as clinically indicated. In paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL treated with dasatinib in \ncombination with chemotherapy, CBCs should be performed prior to the start of each block of \nchemotherapy and as clinically indicated. During the consolidation blocks of chemotherapy, CBCs \nshould be performed every 2 days until recovery (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Myelosuppression is \ngenerally reversible and usually managed by withholding dasatinib temporarily or by dose reduction. \n \n\n\n\n 9\n\nBleeding \nIn patients with chronic phase CML (n=548), 5 patients (1%) receiving dasatinib had \ngrade 3 or 4 haemorrhage. In clinical studies in patients with advanced phase CML receiving the \nrecommended dose of SPRYCEL (n=304), severe central nervous system (CNS) haemorrhage \noccurred in 1% of patients. One case was fatal and was associated with Common Toxicity Criteria \n(CTC) grade 4 thrombocytopaenia. Grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred in 6% of \npatients with advanced phase CML and generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. \nOther grade 3 or 4 haemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients with advanced phase CML. Most bleeding \nrelated adverse reactions in these patients were typically associated with \ngrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopaenia (see section 4.8). Additionally, in vitro and in vivo platelet assays \nsuggest that SPRYCEL treatment reversibly affects platelet activation. \n \nCaution should be exercised if patients are required to take medicinal products that inhibit platelet \nfunction or anticoagulants. \n \nFluid retention \nDasatinib is associated with fluid retention. In the Phase III clinical study in patients with newly \ndiagnosed chronic phase CML, grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 13 patients (5%) in the \ndasatinib-treatment group and in 2 patients (1%) in the imatinib-treatment group after a minimum of \n60 months follow-up (see section 4.8). In all SPRYCEL treated patients with chronic phase CML, \nsevere fluid retention occurred in 32 patients (6%) receiving SPRYCEL at the recommended dose \n(n=548). In clinical studies in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL receiving SPRYCEL at \nthe recommended dose (n=304), grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 8% of patients, including \ngrade 3 or 4 pleural and pericardial effusion reported in 7% and 1% of patients, respectively. In these \npatients grade 3 or 4 pulmonary oedema and pulmonary hypertension were each reported in 1% of \npatients. \n \nPatients who develop symptoms suggestive of pleural effusion such as dyspnoea or dry cough should \nbe evaluated by chest X-ray. Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion may require thoracocentesis and oxygen \ntherapy. Fluid retention adverse reactions were typically managed by supportive care measures that \ninclude diuretics and short courses of steroids (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Patients aged 65 years and \nolder are more likely than younger patients to experience pleural effusion, dyspnoea, cough, \npericardial effusion and congestive heart failure, and should be monitored closely. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \nPAH (pre-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension confirmed by right heart catheterization) has been \nreported in association with dasatinib treatment (see section 4.8). In these cases, PAH was reported \nafter initiation of dasatinib therapy, including after more than one year of treatment. \n \nPatients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to \ninitiating dasatinib therapy. An echocardiography should be performed at treatment initiation in every \npatient presenting symptoms of cardiac disease and considered in patients with risk factors for cardiac \nor pulmonary disease. Patients who develop dyspnoea and fatigue after initiation of therapy should be \nevaluated for common etiologies including pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, anaemia, or lung \ninfiltration. In accordance with recommendations for management of non-haematologic adverse \nreactions (see section 4.2) the dose of dasatinib should be reduced or therapy interrupted during this \nevaluation. If no explanation is found, or if there is no improvement with dose reduction or \ninterruption, the diagnosis of PAH should be considered. The diagnostic approach should follow \nstandard practice guidelines. If PAH is confirmed, dasatinib should be permanently discontinued. \nFollow up should be performed according to standard practice guidelines. Improvements in \nhaemodynamic and clinical parameters have been observed in dasatinib-treated patients with PAH \nfollowing cessation of dasatinib therapy. \n \nQT Prolongation \nIn vitro data suggest that dasatinib has the potential to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation (QT \nInterval) (see section 5.3). In 258 dasatinib-treated patients and 258 imatinib-treated patients with a \nminimum of 60 months follow-up in the Phase III study in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, 1 \n\n\n\n 10\n\npatient (< 1%) in each group had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. The median \nchanges in QTcF from baseline were 3.0 msec in dasatinib-treated patients compared to 8.2 msec in \nimatinib-treated patients. One patient (< 1%) in each group experienced a QTcF > 500 msec. In \n865 patients with leukaemia treated with dasatinib in Phase II clinical studies, the mean changes from \nbaseline in QTc interval using Fridericia's method (QTcF) were 4 - 6 msec; the upper 95% confidence \nintervals for all mean changes from baseline were < 7 msec (see section 4.8).  \nOf the 2,182 patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy who received dasatinib in \nclinical studies, 15 (1%) had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. Twenty-one of these \npatients (1%) experienced a QTcF > 500 msec.  \n \nDasatinib should be administered with caution to patients who have or may develop prolongation of \nQTc. These include patients with hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, patients with congenital long \nQT syndrome, patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products or other medicinal products which \nlead to QT prolongation, and cumulative high dose anthracycline therapy. Hypokalaemia or \nhypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to dasatinib administration. \n \nCardiac adverse reactions \nDasatinib was studied in a randomised clinical study of 519 patients with newly diagnosed CML in \nchronic phase which included patients with prior cardiac disease. The cardiac adverse reactions of \ncongestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction, pericardial effusion, arrhythmias, palpitations, QT \nprolongation and myocardial infarction (including fatal) were reported in patients taking dasatinib. \nCardiac adverse reactions were more frequent in patients with risk factors or a history of cardiac \ndisease. Patients with risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes) or a history of cardiac \ndisease (e.g. prior percutaneous coronary intervention, documented coronary artery disease) should be \nmonitored carefully for clinical signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction such as chest \npain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. \n \nIf these clinical signs or symptoms develop, physicians are advised to interrupt dasatinib \nadministration and consider the need for alternative CML-specific treatment. After resolution, a \nfunctional assessment should be performed prior to resuming treatment with dasatinib. Dasatinib may \nbe resumed at the original dose for mild/moderate adverse reactions (≤ grade 2) and resumed at a dose \nlevel reduction for severe adverse reactions (≥ grade 3) (see section 4.2). Patients continuing treatment \nshould be monitored periodically. \n \nPatients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease were not included in the clinical \nstudies. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \nBCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), \nincluding individual case reports for SPRYCEL (see section 4.8). If laboratory or clinical findings \nassociated with TMA occur in a patient receiving SPRYCEL, treatment with SPRYCEL should be \ndiscontinued and thorough evaluation for TMA, including ADAMTS13 activity and anti-\nADAMTS13-antibody determination, should be completed. If anti-ADAMTS13-antibody is elevated \nin conjunction with low ADAMTS13 activity, treatment with SPRYCEL should not be resumed. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these \npatients received BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or \nfulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome.  \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with SPRYCEL. Experts in \nliver disease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in \npatients with positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who \ntest positive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with \nSPRYCEL should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout \ntherapy and for several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n 11\n\nEffects on growth and development in paediatric patients \nIn paediatric trials of SPRYCEL in imatinib-resistant/intolerant Ph+ CML-CP paediatric patients and \ntreatment-naive Ph+ CML-CP paediatric patients after at least 2 years of treatment, treatment-related \nadverse events associated with bone growth and development were reported in 6 (4.6%) patients, one \nof which was severe in intensity (Growth Retardation Grade 3). These 6 cases included cases of \nepiphyses delayed fusion, osteopaenia, growth retardation, and gynecomastia (see section 5.1). These \nresults are difficult to interpret in the context of chronic diseases such as CML, and require long-term \nfollow-up. \n \nIn paediatric trials of SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL \npaediatric patients after a maximum of 2 years of treatment, treatment-related adverse events \nassociated with bone growth and development were reported in 1 (0.6%) patient. This case was a \nGrade 1 osteopenia. \n \nExcipients \nLactose \nThis medicinal product contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \ngalactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nActive substances that may increase dasatinib plasma concentrations \nIn vitro studies indicate that dasatinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of dasatinib and \nmedicinal products or substances which potently inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nerythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, telithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase exposure to \ndasatinib. Therefore, in patients receiving dasatinib, systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor is not recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nAt clinically relevant concentrations, binding of dasatinib to plasma proteins is approximately 96% on \nthe basis of in vitro experiments. No studies have been performed to evaluate dasatinib interaction \nwith other protein-bound medicinal products. The potential for displacement and its clinical relevance \nare unknown. \n \nActive substances that may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations \nWhen dasatinib was administered following 8 daily evening administrations of 600 mg rifampicin, a \npotent CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of dasatinib was decreased by 82%. Other medicinal products that \ninduce CYP3A4 activity (e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or herbal \npreparations containing Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. John´s Wort) may also increase \nmetabolism and decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant use of potent \nCYP3A4 inducers with dasatinib is not recommended. In patients in whom rifampicin or other \nCYP3A4 inducers are indicated, alternative medicinal products with less enzyme induction potential \nshould be used. Concomitant use of dexamethasone, a weak CYP3A4 inducer, with dasatinib is \nallowed; dasatinib AUC is predicted to decrease approximately 25% with concomitant use of \ndexamethasone, which is not likely to be clinically meaningful. \n \nHistamine-2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors \nLong-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (e.g. \nfamotidine and omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. In a single-dose study in healthy \nsubjects, the administration of famotidine 10 hours prior to a single dose of SPRYCEL reduced \ndasatinib exposure by 61%. In a study of 14 healthy subjects, administration of a single 100-mg dose \nof SPRYCEL 22 hours following a 4-day, 40-mg omeprazole dose at steady state reduced the AUC of \ndasatinib by 43% and the Cmax of dasatinib by 42%. The use of antacids should be considered in place \nof H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving SPRYCEL therapy (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 12\n\nAntacids \nNon-clinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH-dependent. In healthy subjects, the \nconcomitant use of aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide antacids with SPRYCEL reduced the \nAUC of a single dose of SPRYCEL by 55% and the Cmax by 58%. However, when antacids were \nadministered 2 hours prior to a single dose of SPRYCEL, no relevant changes in dasatinib \nconcentration or exposure were observed. Thus, antacids may be administered up to 2 hours prior to or \n2 hours following SPRYCEL (see section 4.4). \n \nActive substances that may have their plasma concentrations altered by dasatinib \nConcomitant use of dasatinib and a CYP3A4 substrate may increase exposure to the CYP3A4 \nsubstrate. In a study in healthy subjects, a single 100 mg dose of dasatinib increased AUC and Cmax \nexposure to simvastatin, a known CYP3A4 substrate, by 20 and 37% respectively. It cannot be \nexcluded that the effect is larger after multiple doses of dasatinib. Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates \nknown to have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, \nquinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids [ergotamine, dihydroergotamine]) should be administered with \ncaution in patients receiving dasatinib (see section 4.4). \nIn vitro data indicate a potential risk for interaction with CYP2C8 substrates, such as glitazones. \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \nBoth sexually active men and women of childbearing potential should use effective methods of \ncontraception during treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nBased on human experience, dasatinib is suspected to cause congenital malformations including neural \ntube defects, and harmful pharmacological effects on the foetus when administered during pregnancy. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \nSPRYCEL should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with dasatinib. If SPRYCEL is used during pregnancy, the patient must be informed of the \npotential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere is insufficient/limited information on the excretion of dasatinib in human or animal breast milk. \nPhysico-chemical and available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data on dasatinib point to excretion in \nbreast milk and a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. \nBreast-feeding should be stopped during treatment with SPRYCEL. \n \nFertility \nIn animal studies, the fertility of male and female rats was not affected by treatment with dasatinib \n(see section 5.3). Physicians and other healthcare providers should counsel male patients of \nappropriate age about possible effects of SPRYCEL on fertility, and this counseling may include \nconsideration of semen deposition. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSPRYCEL has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised \nthat they may experience adverse reactions such as dizziness or blurred vision during treatment with \ndasatinib. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe data described below reflect the exposure to SPRYCEL as single-agent therapy at all doses tested \n\n\n\n 13\n\nin clinical studies (N=2,900), including 324 adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, \n2,388 adult patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic or advanced phase CML or \nPh+ ALL, and 188 paediatric patients. \n \nIn the 2,712 adult patients with either chronic phase CML, advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, the \nmedian duration of therapy was 19.2 months (range 0 to 93.2 months). In a randomized trial in patients \nwith newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, the median duration of therapy was approximately \n60 months. The median duration of therapy in 1,618 adult patients with chronic phase CML was \n29 months (range 0 to 92.9 months). The median duration of therapy in 1,094 adult patients with \nadvanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL was 6.2 months (range 0 to 93.2 months). Among 188 patients in \npaediatric studies, the median duration of therapy was 26.3 months (range 0 to 99.6 months). In the \nsubset of 130 chronic phase CML SPRYCEL-treated paediatric patients, the median duration of \ntherapy was 42.3 months (range 0.1 to 99.6 months). \n \nThe majority of SPRYCEL-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some time. In the overall \npopulation of 2,712 SPRYCEL-treated adult subjects, 520 (19%) experienced adverse reactions \nleading to treatment discontinuation. \n \nThe overall safety profile of SPRYCEL in the paediatric Ph+ CML-CP population was similar to that \nof the adult population, regardless of formulation, with the exception of no reported pericardial \neffusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, or pulmonary hypertension in the paediatric population. \nOf the 130 SPRYCEL-treated paediatric subjects with CML-CP, 2 (1.5%) experienced adverse \nreactions leading to treatment discontinuation. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions, excluding laboratory abnormalities, were reported in patients treated \nwith SPRYCEL used as single-agent therapy in clinical studies and post-marketing experience \n(Table 5). These reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency.

Their \noccurrence is earlier and more frequent in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in \nchronic phase CML (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n 16\n\nBleeding \nBleeding drug-related adverse reactions, ranging from petechiae and epistaxis to \ngrade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal haemorrhage and CNS bleeding, were reported in patients taking \nSPRYCEL (see section 4.4). \n \nFluid retention \nMiscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and pericardial \neffusion with or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as “fluid retention”. In the \nnewly diagnosed chronic phase CML study after a minimum of 60 months follow-up, dasatinib-related \nfluid retention adverse reactions included pleural effusion (28%), superficial oedema (14%), \npulmonary hypertension (5%), generalised oedema (4%), and pericardial effusion (4%). Congestive \nheart failure/cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary oedema were reported in < 2% of patients. \nThe cumulative rate of dasatinib-related pleural effusion (all grades) over time was 10% at 12 months, \n14% at 24 months, 19% at 36 months, 24% at 48 months and 28% at 60 months. A total of \n46 dasatinib-treated patients had recurrent pleural effusions. Seventeen patients had 2 separate adverse \nreactions, 6 had 3 adverse reactions, 18 had 4 to 8 adverse reactions and 5 had > 8 episodes of pleural \neffusions. \nThe median time to first dasatinib-related grade 1 or 2 pleural effusion was 114 weeks (range:  4 to \n299 weeks). Less than 10% of patients with pleural effusion had severe (grade 3 or 4) dasatinib-related \npleural effusions. The median time to first occurrence of grade ≥ 3 dasatinib-related pleural effusion \nwas 175 weeks (range: 114 to 274 weeks). The median duration of dasatinib-related pleural effusion \n(all grades) was 283 days (~40 weeks). \nPleural effusion was usually reversible and managed by interrupting SPRYCEL treatment and using \ndiuretics or other appropriate supportive care measures (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Among \ndasatinib-treated patients with drug-related pleural effusion (n=73), 45 (62%) had dose interruptions \nand 30 (41%) had dose reductions. Additionally, 34 (47%) received diuretics, 23 (32%) received \ncorticosteroids, and 20 (27%) received both corticosteroids and diuretics. Nine (12%) patients \nunderwent therapeutic thoracentesis. \nSix percent of dasatinib-treated patients discontinued treatment due to drug-related pleural effusion. \nPleural effusion did not impair the ability of patients to obtain a response. Among the dasatinib-treated \npatients with pleural effusion, 96% achieved a cCCyR, 82% achieved a MMR, and 50% achieved a \nMR4.5 despite dose interruptions or dose adjustment. \nSee section 4.4 for further information on patients with chronic phase CML and advanced phase CML \nor Ph+ ALL. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \nPAH (pre-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension confirmed by right heart catheterization) has been \nreported in association with dasatinib exposure. In these cases, PAH was reported after initiation of \ndasatinib therapy, including after more than one year of treatment. Patients with PAH reported during \ndasatinib treatment were often taking concomitant medicinal products or had co-morbidities in \naddition to the underlying malignancy. Improvements in haemodynamic and clinical parameters have \nbeen observed in patients with PAH following discontinuation of dasatinib. \n \nQT Prolongation \nIn the Phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, one patient (< 1%) of the \nSPRYCEL-treated patients had a QTcF > 500 msec after a minimum of 12 months follow-up (see \nsection 4.4). No additional patients were reported to have QTcF > 500 msec after a minimum of \n60 months follow-up. \nIn 5 Phase II clinical studies in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy, \nrepeated baseline and on-treatment ECGs were obtained at pre-specified time points and read centrally \nfor 865 patients receiving SPRYCEL 70 mg twice daily. QT interval was corrected for heart rate by \nFridericia's method. At all post-dose time points on day 8, the mean changes from baseline in QTcF \ninterval were 4 - 6 msec, with associated upper 95% confidence intervals < 7 msec. Of the \n2,182 patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy who received SPRYCEL in \nclinical studies, 15 (1%) had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. Twenty-one patients \n(1%) experienced a QTcF > 500 msec (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 17\n\nCardiac adverse reactions \nPatients with risk factors or a history of cardiac disease should be monitored carefully for signs or \nsymptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction and should be evaluated and treated appropriately (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nHepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in \nacute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn the Phase III dose-optimisation study in patients with chronic phase CML with resistance or \nintolerance to prior imatinib therapy (median duration of treatment of 30 months), the incidence of \npleural effusion and congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction was lower in patients treated with \nSPRYCEL 100 mg once daily than in those treated with SPRYCEL 70 mg twice daily. \nMyelosuppression was also reported less frequently in the 100 mg once daily treatment group (see \nLaboratory test abnormalities below). The median duration of therapy in the 100 mg once daily group \nwas 37 months (range 1-91 months). Cumulative rates of selected adverse reactions that were reported \nin the 100 mg once daily recommended starting dose are shown in Table 6a. \n \nTable 6a: Selected adverse reactions reported in a phase 3 dose optimisation study (imatinib \n\nintolerant or resistant chronic phase CML)a  \n\n Minimum of 2 years follow up \nMinimum of 5 years \n\nfollow up \nMinimum of 7 years \n\nfollow up \n All \n\ngrades \nGrade \n\n3/4 \nAll \n\ngrades \nGrade \n\n3/4 \nAll \n\ngrades \nGrade \n\n3/4 \nPreferred term Percent (%) of patients \nDiarrhoea 27 2 28 2 28 2 \nFluid retention 34 4 42 6 48 7 \n Superficial oedema 18 0 21 0 22 0 \n Pleural effusion 18 2 24 4 28 5 \n Generalised oedema 3 0 4 0 4 0 \n Pericardial effusion 2 1 2 1 3 1 \n Pulmonary \n\nhypertension 0 0 0 0 2 1 \n\nHaemorrhage 11 1 11 1 12 1 \n Gastrointestinal \n\nbleeding 2 1 2 1 2 1 \na Phase 3 dose optimisation study results reported in recommended starting dose of 100 mg once daily (n=165) population \n \nIn the Phase III dose-optimisation study in patients with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL, the \nmedian duration of treatment was 14 months for accelerated phase CML, 3 months for myeloid blast \nCML, 4 months for lymphoid blast CML and 3 months for Ph+ ALL. Selected adverse reactions that \nwere reported in the recommended starting dose of 140 mg once daily are shown in Table 6b. A 70 mg \ntwice daily regimen was also studied.

In the pivotal study, 106 paediatric \npatients received SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy on a continuous dosing regimen. In a \nsupportive study, of 55 paediatric patients, 35 received SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy \non a discontinuous dosing regimen (two weeks on treatment followed by one to two weeks off) and \n20 received SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy on a continuous dosing regimen. Among \nthe 126 Ph+ ALL paediatric patients treated with SPRYCEL on a continuous dosing regimen, the \nmedian duration of therapy was 23.6 months (range 1.4 to 33 months).  \n \nOf the 126 Ph+ ALL paediatric patients on a continuous dosing regimen, 2 (1.6%) experienced \nadverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation. Adverse reactions reported in these two \npaediatric studies at a frequency of 10% in patients on a continuous dosing regimen are shown in \nTable 7. Of note, pleural effusion was reported in 7 (5.6%) patients in this group, and is therefore not \nincluded in the table. \n \n\nTable 7: Adverse reactions reported in ≥10% of paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL treated \nwith SPRYCEL on a continuous dosing regimen in combination with chemotherapy \n(N=126)a \n\n Percent (%) of patients \nAdverse reaction All grades Grade 3/4 \n\nFebrile neutropaenia 27.0 26.2 \nNausea 20.6 5.6 \nVomiting 20.6 4.8 \nAbdominal pain 14.3 3.2 \nDiarrhoea 12.7 4.8 \nPyrexia 12.7 5.6 \nHeadache 11.1 4.8 \nDecreased appetite 10.3 4.8 \nFatigue 10.3 0 \n\na In the pivotal study, among 106 total patients, 24 patients received the powder for oral suspension at least once, 8 of whom \nreceived the powder for oral suspension formulation exclusively. \n\n \n\n\n\n 19\n\nLaboratory test abnormalities \nHaematology  \nIn the Phase III newly diagnosed chronic phase CML study, the following grade 3 or 4 laboratory \nabnormalities were reported after a minimum of 12 months follow-up in patients taking SPRYCEL: \nneutropaenia (21%), thrombocytopaenia (19%), and anaemia (10%). After a minimum of 60 months \nfollow-up, the cumulative rates of neutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia, and anaemia were 29%, 22% and \n13%, respectively. \n \nIn SPRYCEL-treated patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML who experienced \ngrade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following brief dose interruptions and/or \nreductions and permanent discontinuation of treatment occurred in 1.6% of patients after a minimum \nof 12 months follow-up. After a minimum of 60 months follow-up the cumulative rate of permanent \ndiscontinuation due to grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was 2.3%. \n \nIn patients with CML with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy, cytopaenias \n(thrombocytopaenia, neutropaenia, and anaemia) were a consistent finding. However, the occurrence \nof cytopaenias was also clearly dependent on the stage of the disease.

Most patients continued treatment without further evidence of myelosuppression. \n \nBiochemistry  \nIn the newly diagnosed chronic phase CML study, grade 3 or 4 hypophosphataemia was reported \nin 4% of SPRYCEL-treated patients, and grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases, creatinine, and \nbilirubin were reported in ≤ 1% of patients after a minimum of 12 months follow-up. After a minimum \nof 60 months follow-up the cumulative rate of grade 3 or 4 hypophosphataemia was 7%, \ngrade 3 or 4 elevations of creatinine and bilirubin was 1% and grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases \nremained 1%. There were no discontinuations of SPRYCEL therapy due to these biochemical \nlaboratory parameters. \n \n2 year follow-up \nGrade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in 1% of patients with chronic \nphase CML (resistant or intolerant to imatinib), but elevations were reported with an increased \nfrequency of 1 to 7% of patients with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL. It was usually managed \nwith dose reduction or interruption. In the Phase III dose-optimisation study in chronic phase CML, \ngrade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in ≤ 1% of patients with similar \n\n\n\n 20\n\nlow incidence in the four treatment groups. In the Phase III dose-optimisation study in advanced phase \nCML and Ph+ALL, grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in 1% to 5% of \npatients across treatment groups. \n \nApproximately 5% of the SPRYCEL-treated patients who had normal baseline levels experienced \ngrade 3 or 4 transient hypocalcaemia at some time during the course of the study. In general, there was \nno association of decreased calcium with clinical symptoms. Patients developing \ngrade 3 or 4 hypocalcaemia often had recovery with oral calcium supplementation. \nGrade 3 or 4 hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, and hypophosphataemia were reported in patients with all \nphases of CML but were reported with an increased frequency in patients with myeloid or lymphoid \nblast phase CML and Ph+ ALL. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in creatinine were reported in < 1% of \npatients with chronic phase CML and were reported with an increased frequency of 1 to 4% of patients \nwith advanced phase CML. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety profile of SPRYCEL administered as single-agent therapy in paediatric patients with \nPh+ CML-CP was comparable to the safety profile in adults. The safety profile of SPRYCEL \nadministered in combination with chemotherapy in paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL was consistent \nwith the known safety profile of SPRYCEL in adults and the expected effects of chemotherapy, with \nthe exception of a lower pleural effusion rate in paediatric patients as compared to adults. \n \nIn the paediatric CML studies, the rates of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known \nprofile for laboratory parameters in adults. \n \nIn the paediatric ALL studies, the rates of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known \nprofile for laboratory parameters in adults, within the context of an acute leukaemia patient receiving a \nbackground chemotherapy regimen. \n \nSpecial population \nWhile the safety profile of SPRYCEL in elderly was similar to that in the younger population, patients \naged 65 years and older are more likely to experience the commonly reported adverse reactions such \nas fatigue, pleural effusion, dyspnoea, cough, lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and appetite \ndisturbance and more likely to experience less frequently reported adverse reactions such as \nabdominal distention, dizziness, pericardial effusion, congestive heart failure, and weight decrease and \nshould be monitored closely (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience with overdose of SPRYCEL in clinical studies is limited to isolated cases. The highest \noverdose of 280 mg per day for one week was reported in two patients and both developed a \nsignificant decrease in platelet counts. Since dasatinib is associated with \ngrade 3 or 4 myelosuppression (see section 4.4), patients who ingest more than the recommended dose \nshould be closely monitored for myelosuppression and given appropriate supportive treatment. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE06 \n \nPharmacodynamics \n\n\n\n 21\n\nDasatinib inhibits the activity of the BCR-ABL kinase and SRC family kinases along with a number of \nother selected oncogenic kinases including c-KIT, ephrin (EPH) receptor kinases, and PDGFβ \nreceptor. Dasatinib is a potent, subnanomolar inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase with potency at \nconcentration of 0.6-0.8 nM. It binds to both the inactive and active conformations of the BCR-ABL \nenzyme. \n \nMechanism of action \nIn vitro, dasatinib is active in leukaemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib-sensitive and \nresistant disease. These non-clinical studies show that dasatinib can overcome imatinib resistance \nresulting from BCR-ABL overexpression, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate \nsignalling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multidrug resistance gene \noverexpression. Additionally, dasatinib inhibits SRC family kinases at subnanomolar concentrations. \n \nIn vivo, in separate experiments using murine models of CML, dasatinib prevented the progression of \nchronic CML to blast phase and prolonged the survival of mice bearing patient-derived CML cell lines \ngrown at various sites, including the central nervous system. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn the Phase I study, haematologic and cytogenetic responses were observed in all phases of CML and \nin Ph+ ALL in the first 84 patients treated and followed for up to 27 months. Responses were durable \nacross all phases of CML and Ph+ ALL.  \n \nFour single-arm, uncontrolled, open-label Phase II clinical studies were conducted to determine the \nsafety and efficacy of dasatinib in patients with CML in chronic, accelerated, or myeloid blast phase, \nwho were either resistant or intolerant to imatinib. One randomised non-comparative study was \nconducted in chronic phase patients who failed initial treatment with 400 or 600 mg imatinib. The \nstarting dose was 70 mg dasatinib twice daily. Dose modifications were allowed for improving activity \nor management of toxicity (see section 4.2). \nTwo randomised, open-label Phase III studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dasatinib \nadministered once daily compared with dasatinib administered twice daily. In addition, one \nopen-label, randomised, comparative Phase III study was conducted in adult patients with newly \ndiagnosed chronic phase CML. \n \nThe efficacy of dasatinib is based on haematological and cytogenetic response rates. \nDurability of response and estimated survival rates provide additional evidence of dasatinib clinical \nbenefit. \n \nA total of 2,712 patients were evaluated in clinical studies; of these 23% were ≥ 65 years of age and \n5% were ≥ 75 years of age.  \n \nChronic phase CML - Newly diagnosed \nAn international open-label, multicentre, randomised, comparative Phase III study was conducted in \nadult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML. Patients were randomised to receive either \nSPRYCEL 100 mg once daily or imatinib 400 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was the rate of \nconfirmed complete cytogenetic response (cCCyR) within 12 months. Secondary endpoints included \ntime in cCCyR (measure of durability of response), time to cCCyR, major molecular response (MMR) \nrate, time to MMR, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Other relevant efficacy \nresults included CCyR and complete molecular response (CMR) rates. The study is ongoing. \n \nA total of 519 patients were randomised to a treatment group: 259 to SPRYCEL and 260 to imatinib. \nBaseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups with respect to age \n(median age was 46 years for the SPRYCEL group and 49 years for the imatinib group with 10% and \n11% of patients 65 years of age or older, respectively), gender (women 44% and 37%, respectively), \nand race (Caucasian 51% and 55%; Asian 42% and 37%, respectively). At baseline, the distribution of \nHasford Scores was similar in the SPRYCEL and imatinib treatment groups (low risk: 33% and 34%; \nintermediate risk 48% and 47%; high risk: 19% and 19%, respectively).  \n\n\n\n 22\n\nWith a minimum of 12 months follow-up, 85% of patients randomised to the SPRYCEL group and \n81% of patients randomised to the imatinib group were still receiving first-line treatment. \nDiscontinuation within 12 months due to disease progression occurred in 3% of SPRYCEL-treated \npatients and 5% of imatinib-treated patients. \n \nWith a minimum of 60 months follow-up, 60% of patients randomised to the SPRYCEL group and \n63% of patients randomised to the imatinib group were still receiving first-line treatment. \nDiscontinuation within 60 months due to disease progression occurred in 11% of SPRYCEL-treated \npatients and 14% of imatinib-treated patients. \n \nEfficacy results are presented in Table 9. A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in \nthe SPRYCEL group achieved a cCCyR compared with patients in the imatinib group within the first \n12 months of treatment. Efficacy of SPRYCEL was consistently demonstrated across different \nsubgroups, including age, gender, and baseline Hasford score.  \n \n\n\n\n 23\n\nTable 9: Efficacy results from a phase 3 study of newly diagnosed patients with chronic \nphase CML  \n\n SPRYCEL \nn= 259 \n\nimatinib \nn= 260 \n\np-value \n\n Response rate (95% CI)  \nCytogenetic response     \n\nwithin 12 months    \n cCCyRa  76.8% (71.2–81.8) 66.2% (60.1–71.9) p< 0.007* \n CCyRb 85.3% (80.4-89.4) 73.5% (67.7-78.7)  \n\nwithin 24 months    \ncCCyRa 80.3% 74.2%  \nCCyRb 87.3% 82.3%  \n\nwithin 36 months    \ncCCyRa 82.6% 77.3%  \nCCyRb 88.0% 83.5%  \n\nwithin 48 months    \ncCCyRa 82.6% 78.5%  \nCCyRb 87.6% 83.8%  \n\nwithin 60 months    \ncCCyRa 83.0% 78.5%  \nCCyRb 88.0% 83.8%  \n\nMajor molecular responsec    \n12 months 52.1% (45.9–58.3) 33.8% (28.1–39.9) p< 0.00003* \n24 months  64.5% (58.3-70.3) 50% (43.8-56.2)  \n36 months 69.1% (63.1-74.7) 56.2% (49.9-62.3)  \n48 months 75.7% (70.0-80.8) 62.7% (56.5-68.6)  \n60 months 76.4% (70.8-81.5) 64.2% (58.1-70.1) p=0.0021 \n\n Hazard ratio (HR)  \n within 12 months (99.99% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.55 (1.0-2.3) p< 0.0001* \nTime-to MMR 2.01 (1.2-3.4) p< 0.0001* \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.7 (0.4-1.4) p< 0.035 \n within 24 months (95% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.49 (1.22-1.82)  \nTime-to MMR 1.69 (1.34-2.12)  \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.77 (0.55-1.10)  \n within 36 months (95% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.48 (1.22-1.80)  \nTime-to MMR 1.59 (1.28-1.99)  \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.77 (0.53-1.11)  \n within 48 months (95% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.45 (1.20-1.77)  \nTime-to MMR 1.55 (1.26-1.91)  \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.81 (0.56-1.17)  \n within 60 months (95% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.46 (1.20-1.77) p=0.0001 \nTime-to MMR 1.54 (1.25-1.89) p<0.0001 \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.79 (0.55-1.13) p=0.1983 \na Confirmed complete cytogenetic response (cCCyR) is defined as a response noted on two consecutive occasions (at least \n\n28 days apart). \nb Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) is based on a single bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation. \nc Major molecular response (at any time) was defined as BCR ABL ratios ≤ 0.1% by RQ PCR in peripheral blood samples \n\nstandardised on the International scale.

The estimated 60-month PFS rate was 88.9% (CI: 84% - 92.4%) for both the dasatinib and \nimatinib treatment groups. At 60 months, transformation to accelerated or blast phase occurred in \nfewer dasatinib-treated patients (n=8; 3%) compared with imatinib-treated patients (n=15; 5.8%). The \nestimated 60-month survival rates for dasatinib and imatinib-treated patients were 90.9% (CI: \n86.6% - 93.8%) and 89.6% (CI: 85.2% - 92.8%), respectively. There was no difference in OS (HR \n1.01, 95% CI: 0.58-1.73, p= 0.9800) and PFS (HR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.58-1.72, p = 0.9998) between \ndasatinib and imatinib. \n \nIn patients who report disease progression or discontinue dasatinib or imatinib therapy, BCR-ABL \nsequencing was performed on blood samples from patients where these are available. Similar rates of \nmutation were observed in both the treatment arms. The mutations detected among the \ndasatinib-treated patients were T315I, F317I/L and V299L. A different spectrum of mutation was \ndetected in the imatinib treatment arm. Dasatinib does not appear to be active against the \nT315I mutation, based on in vitro data. \n \nChronic phase CML - Resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy \nTwo clinical studies were conducted in patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib; the primary efficacy \nendpoint in these studies was Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR).  \n \nStudy 1 \nAn open-label, randomised, non-comparative multicentre study was conducted in patients who failed \ninitial treatment with 400 or 600 mg imatinib. They were randomised (2:1) to either dasatinib (70 mg \ntwice daily) or imatinib (400 mg twice daily). Crossover to the alternative treatment arm was allowed \nif patients showed evidence of disease progression or intolerance that could not be managed by dose \nmodification. The primary endpoint was MCyR at 12 weeks. Results are available for 150 patients: \n101 were randomised to dasatinib and 49 to imatinib (all imatinib-resistant). The median time from \ndiagnosis to randomisation was 64 months in the dasatinib group and 52 months in the imatinib group. \nAll patients were extensively pretreated.

A prior MCyR to imatinib was achieved in 28% and \n29% of the patients in the dasatinib and imatinib arms, respectively. \nMedian duration of treatment was 23 months for dasatinib (with 44% of patients treated for \n> 24 months to date) and 3 months for imatinib (with 10% of patients treated for > 24 months to date). \nNinety-three percent of patients in the dasatinib arm and 82% of patients in the imatinib arm achieved \na CHR prior to crossover. \n \nAt 3 months, a MCyR occurred more often in the dasatinib arm (36%) than in the imatinib arm (29%). \nNotably, 22% of patients reported a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in the dasatinib arm while \nonly 8% achieved a CCyR in the imatinib arm. With longer treatment and follow-up (median of \n24 months), MCyR was achieved in 53% of the dasatinib-treated patients (CCyR in 44%) and 33% of \nthe imatinib-treated patients (CCyR in 18%) prior to crossover. Among patients who had received \nimatinib 400 mg prior to study entry, MCyR was achieved in 61% of patients in the dasatinib arm and \n50% in the imatinib arm. \nBased on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, the proportion of patients who maintained MCyR for 1 year was \n92% (95% CI: [85%-100%]) for dasatinib (CCyR 97%, 95% CI: [92%-100%]) and 74% (95% CI: \n[49%-100%]) for imatinib (CCyR 100%). The proportion of patients who maintained MCyR for \n18 months was 90% (95% CI: [82%-98%]) for dasatinib (CCyR 94%, 95% CI: [87%-100%]) and 74% \n(95% CI: [49%-100%]) for imatinib (CCyR 100%). \n \nBased on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, the proportion of patients who had progression-free survival \n(PFS) for 1 year was 91% (95% CI: [85%-97%]) for dasatinib and 73% (95% CI: [54%-91%]) for \nimatinib. The proportion of patients who had PFS at 2 years was 86% (95% CI: [78%-93%]) for \ndasatinib and 65% (95% CI: [43%-87%]) for imatinib. \n \nA total of 43% of the patients in the dasatinib arm, and 82% in the imatinib arm had treatment failure, \ndefined as disease progression or cross-over to the other treatment (lack of response, intolerance of \nstudy medicinal product, etc.). \n \nThe rate of major molecular response (defined as BCR-ABL/control transcripts ≤ 0.1% by RQ-PCR in \nperipheral blood samples) prior to crossover was 29% for dasatinib and 12% for imatinib. \n \nStudy 2 \nAn open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients resistant or intolerant to \nimatinib (i.e. patients who experienced significant toxicity during treatment with imatinib that \nprecluded further treatment). \nA total of 387 patients received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (288 resistant and 99 intolerant). The \nmedian time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 61 months. The majority of the patients (53%) \nhad received prior imatinib treatment for more than 3 years. Most resistant patients (72%) had \nreceived > 600 mg imatinib. In addition to imatinib, 35% of patients had received prior cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, 65% had received prior interferon, and 10% had received a prior stem cell transplant. \nThirty-eight percent of patients had baseline mutations known to confer imatinib resistance. Median \nduration of treatment on dasatinib was 24 months with 51% of patients treated for > 24 months to date. \nEfficacy results are reported in Table 11. MCyR was achieved in 55% of imatinib-resistant patients \nand 82% of imatinib-intolerant patients. With a minimum of 24 months follow-up, 21 of the \n240 patients who had achieved a MCyR had progressed and the median duration of MCyR had not \nbeen reached. \n \nBased on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, 95% (95% CI: [92%-98%]) of the patients maintained MCyR \nfor 1 year and 88% (95% CI: [83%-93%]) maintained MCyR for 2 years. The proportion of patients \nwho maintained CCyR for 1 year was 97% (95% CI: [94%-99%]) and for 2 years was 90% (95% CI: \n[86%-95%]). Forty-two percent of the imatinib-resistant patients with no prior MCyR to imatinib \n(n= 188) achieved a MCyR with dasatinib. \nThere were 45 different BCR-ABL mutations in 38% of patients enrolled in this study. Complete \nhaematologic response or MCyR was achieved in patients harbouring a variety of BCR-ABL \nmutations associated with imatinib resistance except T315I. The rates of MCyR at 2 years were similar \n\n\n\n 29\n\nwhether patients had any baseline BCR-ABL mutation, P-loop mutation, or no mutation (63%, 61% \nand 62%, respectively). \n \nAmong imatinib-resistant patients, the estimated rate of PFS was 88% (95% CI: [84%-92%]) at 1 year \nand 75% (95% CI: [69%-81%]) at 2 years. Among imatinib-intolerant patients, the estimated rate of \nPFS was 98% (95% CI: [95%-100%]) at 1 year and 94% (95% CI: [88%-99%]) at 2 years. \n \nThe rate of major molecular response at 24 months was 45% (35% for imatinib-resistant patients and \n74% for imatinib-intolerant patients). \n \nAccelerated phase CML \nAn open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients intolerant or resistant to \nimatinib. A total of 174 patients received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (161 resistant and 13 intolerant \nto imatinib). The median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 82 months. Median duration of \ntreatment on dasatinib was 14 months with 31% of patients treated for > 24 months to date. The rate of \nmajor molecular response (assessed in 41 patients with a CCyR) was 46% at 24 months. Further \nefficacy results are reported in Table 11. \n \nMyeloid blast phase CML \nAn open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients intolerant or resistant to \nimatinib. A total of 109 patients received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (99 resistant and 10 intolerant to \nimatinib). The median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 48 months. Median duration of \ntreatment on dasatinib was 3.5 months with 12% of patients treated for > 24 months to date. The rate \nof major molecular response (assessed in 19 patients with a CCyR) was 68% at 24 months. Further \nefficacy results are reported in Table 11. \n \nLymphoid blast phase CML and Ph+ ALL \nAn open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients with lymphoid blast phase \nCML or Ph+ ALL who were resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib therapy. A total of 48 patients \nwith lymphoid blast CML received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (42 resistant and 6 intolerant to \nimatinib). The median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 28 months. Median duration of \ntreatment on dasatinib was 3 months with 2% treated for > 24 months to date. The rate of major \nmolecular response (all 22 treated patients with a CCyR) was 50% at 24 months. In addition, \n46 patients with Ph+ ALL received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (44 resistant and 2 intolerant to \nimatinib). The median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 18 months. Median duration of \ntreatment on dasatinib was 3 months with 7% of patients treated for > 24 months to date. The rate of \nmajor molecular response (all 25 treated patients with a CCyR) was 52% at 24 months. Further \nefficacy results are reported in Table 11. Of note, major haematologic responses (MaHR) were \nachieved quickly (most within 35 days of first dasatinib administration for patients with lymphoid \nblast CML, and within 55 days for patients with Ph+ ALL). \n \n\n\n\n 30\n\nTable 11: Efficacy in phase II SPRYCEL single-arm clinical studiesa \n\n Chronic \n(n= 387) \n\nAccelerated\n(n= 174) \n\nMyeloid \nblast \n\n(n= 109) \n\nLymphoid \nblast \n\n(n= 48) \nPh+ ALL \n(n= 46) \n\nHaematologic response rateb (%) \n\nMaHR (95% CI) n/a 64% (57-72) \n33% \n\n(24-43) \n35% \n\n(22-51) \n41% \n\n(27-57) \n CHR (95% CI) 91% (88-94) 50% (42-58) 26% (18-35) 29% (17-44) 35% (21-50) \n NEL (95% CI) n/a 14% (10-21) 7% (3-14) 6% (1-17) 7% (1-18) \nDuration of MaHR (%; Kaplan-Meier estimates)    \n 1 year n/a 79% (71-87) 71% (55-87) 29% (3-56) 32% (8-56) \n 2 year n/a 60% (50-70) 41% (21-60) 10% (0-28) 24% (2-47) \nCytogenetic responsec (%) \n\nMCyR (95% CI) 62% (57-67) 40% (33-48) 34% (25-44) 52% (37-67) 57% (41-71) \n\n CCyR (95% CI) 54% (48-59) 33% (26-41) 27% (19-36) 46% (31-61) 54% (39-69) \nSurvival (%; Kaplan-Meier estimates) \nProgression-Free  \n 1 year \n\n \n91% (88-94) \n\n \n64% (57-72) \n\n \n35% (25-45) \n\n \n14% (3-25) \n\n \n21% (9-34) \n\n 2 year 80% (75-84) 46% (38-54) 20% (11-29) 5% (0-13) 12% (2-23) \nOverall  \n 1 year \n\n \n97% (95-99) \n\n \n83% (77-89) \n\n \n48% (38-59) \n\n \n30% (14-47) \n\n \n35% (20-51) \n\n 2 year 94% (91-97) 72% (64-79) 38% (27-50) 26% (10-42) 31% (16-47) \nData described in this table are from studies using a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily.

After 24 months of follow-up, \nOS in newly diagnosed patients was 100%, and 96.6% in imatinib-resistant or intolerant patients. \nIn the Phase II paediatric study, 1 newly diagnosed patient and 2 imatinib-resistant or intolerant \npatients progressed to blast phase CML. \n \nThere were 33 newly diagnosed paediatric patients with CML-CP who received SPRYCEL powder \nfor oral suspension at a dose of 72 mg/m2. This dose represents 30% lower exposure compared to the \nrecommended dose (see section 5.2. of Summary of Product Characteristics for SPRYCEL powder for \noral suspension). In these patients, CCyR and MMR were CCyR: 87.9% [95% CI: (71.8-96.6)] and \nMMR: 45.5% [95% CI: (28.1-63.6)] at 12 months. \n \nAmong dasatinib-treated CML-CP paediatric patients previously exposed to imatinib, the mutations \ndetected at the end of treatment were: T315A, E255K and F317L. However, E255K and F317L were \nalso detected prior to treatment. There were no mutations detected in newly diagnosed CML-CP \npatients at the end of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n 34\n\nPaediatric patients with ALL \nThe efficacy of SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy was evaluated in a pivotal study in \npaediatric patients over one year of age with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. \n \nIn this multicenter, historically-controlled Phase II study of dasatinib added to standard chemotherapy, \n106 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, of whom 104 patients had confirmed \nPh+ ALL, received dasatinib at a daily dose of 60 mg/m2 on a continuous dosing regimen for up to \n24 months, in combination with chemotherapy. Eighty-two patients received dasatinib tablets \nexclusively and 24 patients received dasatinib powder for oral suspension at least once, 8 of whom \nreceived dasatinib powder for oral suspension exclusively. The backbone chemotherapy regimen was \nthe same as used in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 trial (chemotherapeutic standard multi-agent \nchemotherapy protocol). The primary efficacy endpoint was 3-year event-free survival (EFS), which \nwas 65.5% (55.5, 73.7).  \n \nThe minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate assessed by Ig/TCR rearrangement was 71.7% by \nthe end of consolidation in all treated patients. When this rate was based on the 85 patients with \nevaluable Ig/TCR assessments, the estimate was 89.4%. The MRD negativity rates at the end of \ninduction and consolidation as measured by flow cytometry were 66.0% and 84.0%, respectively. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were evaluated in 229 adult healthy subjects and in 84 patients. \n \nAbsorption \nDasatinib is rapidly absorbed in patients following oral administration, with peak concentrations \nbetween 0.5-3 hours. Following oral administration, the increase in the mean exposure (AUCτ) is \napproximately proportional to the dose increment across doses ranging from 25 mg to 120 mg twice \ndaily. The overall mean terminal half-life of dasatinib is approximately 5-6 hours in patients. \n \nData from healthy subjects administered a single 100 mg dose of dasatinib 30 minutes following a \nhigh-fat meal indicated a 14% increase in the mean AUC of dasatinib. A low-fat meal 30 minutes prior \nto dasatinib resulted in a 21% increase in the mean AUC of dasatinib. The observed food effects do \nnot represent clinically relevant changes in exposure. Dasatinib exposure variability is higher under \nfasted conditions (47% CV) compared to light-fat meal (39% CV) and high-fat meal (32% CV) \nconditions. \n \nBased on the patient population PK analysis, variability in dasatinib exposure was estimated to be \nmainly due to inter-occasion variability in bioavailability (44% CV) and, to a lesser extent, due to \ninter-individual variability in bioavailability and inter-individual variability in clearance (30% and \n32% CV, respectively). The random inter-occasion variability in exposure is not expected to affect the \ncumulative exposure and efficacy or safety. \n \nDistribution \nIn patients, dasatinib has a large apparent volume of distribution (2,505 L), coefficient of variation \n(CV% 93%), suggesting that the medicinal product is extensively distributed in the extravascular \nspace. At clinically relevant concentrations of dasatinib, binding to plasma proteins was approximately \n96% on the basis of in vitro experiments. \n \nBiotransformation \nDasatinib is extensively metabolised in humans with multiple enzymes involved in the generation of \nthe metabolites. In healthy subjects administered 100 mg of [14C]-labelled dasatinib, unchanged \ndasatinib represented 29% of circulating radioactivity in plasma. Plasma concentration and measured \nin vitro activity indicate that metabolites of dasatinib are unlikely to play a major role in the observed \npharmacology of the product. CYP3A4 is a major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dasatinib. \n \n\n\n\n 35\n\nElimination \nThe mean terminal half-life of dasatinib is 3 hours to 5 hours. The mean apparent oral clearance is \n363.8 L/hr (CV% 81.3%). \n \nElimination is predominantly in the faeces, mostly as metabolites. Following a single oral dose of \n[14C]-labelled dasatinib, approximately 89% of the dose was eliminated within 10 days, with 4% and \n85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine and faeces, respectively. Unchanged dasatinib \naccounted for 0.1% and 19% of the dose in urine and faeces, respectively, with the remainder of the \ndose as metabolites. \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of dasatinib was assessed in 8 \nmoderately hepatic-impaired subjects who received a 50 mg dose and 5 severely hepatic-impaired \nsubjects who received a 20 mg dose compared to matched healthy subjects who received a 70 mg dose \nof dasatinib. The mean Cmax and AUC of dasatinib adjusted for the 70 mg dose were decreased by 47% \nand 8%, respectively, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal \nhepatic function. In severely hepatic-impaired subjects, the mean Cmax and AUC adjusted for the \n70 mg dose were decreased by 43% and 28%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nDasatinib and its metabolites are minimally excreted via the kidney. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe pharmacokinetics of dasatinib have been evaluated in 104 paediatric patients with leukaemia or \nsolid tumours (72 who received the tablet formulation and 32 who received the powder for oral \nsuspension). \n \nIn a paediatric pharmacokinetics study, dose-normalized dasatinib exposure (Cavg, Cmin and Cmax) \nappears similar between 21 patients with CP-CML and 16 patients with Ph+ ALL. \n \nPharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation of dasatinib were evaluated for 72 paediatric patients with \nrelapsed or refractory leukaemia or solid tumours at oral doses ranging from 60 to 120 mg/m2 once \ndaily and 50 to 110 mg/m2 twice daily. Data was pooled across two studies and showed that dasatinib \nwas rapidly absorbed. Mean Tmax was observed between 0.5 and 6 hours and mean half-life ranged \nfrom 2 to 5 hours across all dose levels and age groups. Dasatinib PK showed dose proportionality \nwith a dose-related increase in exposure observed in paediatric patients. There was no significant \ndifference of dasatinib PK between children and adolescents. The geometric means of dose-\nnormalized dasatinib Cmax, AUC (0-T), and AUC (INF) appeared to be similar between children and \nadolescents at different dose levels. A PPK model-based simulation predicted that the body weight \ntiered dosing recommendation described for the tablet, in section 4.2, is expected to provide similar \nexposure to a tablet dose of 60 mg/m2. These data should be considered if patients are to switch from \ntablets to powder for oral suspension or vice versa. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe non-clinical safety profile of dasatinib was assessed in a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies in \nmice, rats, monkeys, and rabbits. \n \nThe primary toxicities occurred in the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic, and lymphoid systems. \nGastrointestinal toxicity was dose-limiting in rats and monkeys, as the intestine was a consistent target \norgan. In rats, minimal to mild decreases in erythrocyte parameters were accompanied by bone \nmarrow changes; similar changes occurred in monkeys at a lower incidence. Lymphoid toxicity in rats \nconsisted of lymphoid depletion of the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, and decreased lymphoid \norgan weights. Changes in the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were reversible \nfollowing cessation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n 36\n\nRenal changes in monkeys treated for up to 9 months were limited to an increase in background \nkidney mineralisation. Cutaneous haemorrhage was observed in an acute, single-dose oral study in \nmonkeys but was not observed in repeat-dose studies in either monkeys or rats. In rats, dasatinib \ninhibited platelet aggregation in vitro and prolonged cuticle bleeding time in vivo, but did not invoke \nspontaneous haemorrhage. \n \nDasatinib activity in vitro in hERG and Purkinje fiber assays suggested a potential for prolongation of \ncardiac ventricular repolarisation (QT interval). However, in an in vivo single-dose study in conscious \ntelemetered monkeys, there were no changes in QT interval or ECG wave form. \n \nDasatinib was not mutagenic in in vitro bacterial cell assays (Ames test) and was not genotoxic in an \nin vivo rat micronucleus study. Dasatinib was clastogenic in vitro to dividing Chinese Hamster Ovary \n(CHO) cells. \n \nDasatinib did not affect male or female fertility in a conventional rat fertility and early embryonic \ndevelopment study, but induced embryolethality at dose levels approximating human clinical \nexposures. In embryofoetal development studies, dasatinib likewise induced embryolethality with \nassociated decreases in litter size in rats, as well as foetal skeletal alterations in both rats and rabbits. \nThese effects occurred at doses that did not produce maternal toxicity, indicating that dasatinib is a \nselective reproductive toxicant from implantation through the completion of organogenesis. \n \nIn mice, dasatinib induced immunosuppression, which was dose-related and effectively managed by \ndose reduction and/or changes in dosing schedule. Dasatinib had phototoxic potential in an in vitro \nneutral red uptake phototoxicity assay in mouse fibroblasts. Dasatinib was considered to be \nnon-phototoxic in vivo after a single oral administration to female hairless mice at exposures up to \n3-fold the human exposure following administration of the recommended therapeutic dose (based on \nAUC). \n \nIn a two-year carcinogenicity study, rats were administered oral doses of dasatinib at 0.3, 1, and \n3 mg/kg/day. The highest dose resulted in a plasma exposure (AUC) level generally equivalent to the \nhuman exposure at the recommended range of starting doses from 100 mg to 140 mg daily. A \nstatistically significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous cell carcinomas and \npapillomas in the uterus and cervix of high-dose females and of prostate adenoma in low-dose males \nwas noted. The relevance of the findings from the rat carcinogenicity study for humans is not known. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSPRYCEL is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients with: \n newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia in chronic \n\nphase (Ph+ CML-CP) or Ph+ CML-CP resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib. \n  newly diagnosed Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in combination with chemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with \nleukaemia. \n \nPosology \nDosing is on the basis of body weight (see Table 1). Dasatinib is administered orally once daily in the \nform of either SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension or film-coated tablets (see Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for SPRYCEL film-coated tablets). The dose should be recalculated every 3 months \nbased on changes in body weight, or more often if necessary. The tablet is not recommended for \npatients weighing less than 10 kg; the powder for oral suspension should be used for these patients. \nDose increase or reduction is recommended based on individual patient response and tolerability. \nThere is no experience with SPRYCEL treatment in children under 1 year of age. \n \nSPRYCEL film-coated tablets and SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension are not bioequivalent. \nPatients who are able to swallow tablets and who desire to switch from SPRYCEL powder for oral \nsuspension to SPRYCEL tablets or patients who are not able to swallow tablets and who desire to \nswitch from tablets to oral suspension, may do so, provided that the correct dosing recommendations \nfor the dosage form are followed. \n \nThe recommended starting daily dosage of SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension for paediatric \npatients with Ph+ CML-CP or Ph+ ALL and adult patients with Ph+ CML-CP who cannot swallow \ntablets is shown in Table 1. \n\n\n\n 40\n\n \nTable 1: Dosage of SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension for patients with Ph+ CML-CP and \n\npaediatric patients with Ph+ ALL (10 mg/mL suspension upon constitution) \nBody weight (kg)  Daily dose, mL (mg) \n5 to less than 10 kg 4 mL (40 mg) \n\n10 to less than 20 kg 6 mL (60 mg) \n20 to less than 30 kg 9 mL (90 mg) \n30 to less than 45 kg 10.5 mL (105 mg) \n\nat least 45 kg 12 mL (120 mg) \n \nThe dose for the use of powder for oral suspension in adult patients with accelerated, myeloid or \nlymphoid blast phase (advanced phase) CML or Ph+ ALL has not been determined. \n \nTreatment duration \nIn clinical studies, treatment with SPRYCEL in adults with Ph+ CML-CP, accelerated, myeloid or \nlymphoid blast phase (advanced phase) CML, or Ph+ ALL and paediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP \nwas continued until disease progression or until no longer tolerated by the patient. The effect of \nstopping treatment on long-term disease outcome after the achievement of a cytogenetic or molecular \nresponse [including complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR) and \nMR4.5] has not been investigated. \n \nIn clinical studies, treatment with SPRYCEL in paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL was administered \ncontinuously, added to successive blocks of backbone chemotherapy, for a maximum duration of two \nyears. In patients that receive a subsequent stem cell transplantation, SPRYCEL can be administered \nfor an additional year post-transplantation. \n \nTo achieve the recommended dose, SPRYCEL is available as 20 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg \nand 140 mg film-coated tablets and powder for oral suspension (10 mg/mL suspension upon \nconstitution). Dose increase or reduction is recommended based on patient response and tolerability. \n \nDose escalation \nThe following dose escalations shown in Table 2 are recommended in paediatric patients with \nPh+ CML-CP who do not achieve a haematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response at the \nrecommended time points, per current treatment guidelines, and who tolerate the treatment. \n \nTable 2: Dose escalation for patients with Ph+ CML-CP\n Dose (maximum dose per day) \n Starting dose Escalation \n\nPowder for oral suspension 4 mL (40 mg) 5 mL (50 mg) \n 6 mL (60 mg) 8 mL (80 mg) \n 9 mL (90 mg) 12 mL (120 mg) \n 10.5 mL (105 mg) 14 mL (140 mg) \n 12 mL (120 mg) 16 mL (160 mg) \n\n \nDose escalation is not recommended for paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL, as SPRYCEL is \nadministered in combination with chemotherapy in these patients. \n \nDose adjustment for adverse reactions \nMyelosuppression \nIn clinical studies, myelosuppression was managed by dose interruption, dose reduction, or \ndiscontinuation of study therapy. Platelet transfusion and red cell transfusion were used as appropriate. \nHaematopoietic growth factor has been used in patients with resistant myelosuppression. \nGuidelines for dose modifications in paediatric patients with CML-CP are summarised in \nTable 3.Guidelines for paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL treated in combination with chemotherapy \nare in a separate paragraph following the table. \n \n\n\n\n 41\n\nTable 3:  Dose adjustments for neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia in paediatric patients \nwith Ph+ CML-CP \n\n1. If cytopaenia \npersists for more \nthan 3 weeks, \ncheck if \ncytopaenia is \nrelated to \nleukaemia \n(marrow aspirate \nor biopsy).  \n \n2. If cytopaenia is \nunrelated to \nleukaemia, stop \ntreatment until \nANC ≥1.0 × 109/L \nand platelets ≥75 \n× 109/L and \nresume at the \noriginal starting \ndose or at a \nreduced dose.  \n \n3. If cytopaenia \nrecurs, repeat \nmarrow \naspirate/biopsy \nand resume \ntreatment at a \nreduced dose. \n\n Dose (maximum dose per day) \n  \n\nOriginal starting \ndose \n\n \nOne-level dose \n\nreduction \n\n \nTwo-level dose \n\nreduction \nPowder for oral \nsuspension \n\n4 mL (40 mg) 3 mL (30 mg) 2 mL (20 mg) \n6 mL (60 mg) 5 mL (50 mg) 4 mL (40 mg) \n\n 9 mL (90 mg) 7 mL (70 mg) 6 mL (60 mg) \n 10.5 mL (105 mg) 9 mL (90 mg) 7 mL (70 mg) \n 12 mL (120 mg) 10 mL (100 mg) 8 mL (80 mg) \n\nANC: absolute neutrophil count \n \nFor paediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP, if Grade ≥3 neutropaenia or thrombocytopaenia recurs \nduring complete haematologic response (CHR), SPRYCEL should be interrupted, and may be \nsubsequently resumed at a reduced dose. Temporary dose reductions for intermediate degrees of \ncytopaenia and disease response should be implemented as needed. \n \nFor paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL, no dose modification is recommended in cases of haematologic \nGrade 1 to 4 toxicities. If neutropaenia and/or thrombocytopaenia result in delay of the next block of \ntreatment by more than 14 days, SPRYCEL should be interrupted and resumed at the same dose level \nonce the next block of treatment is started. If neutropaenia and/or thrombocytopaenia persist and the \nnext block of treatment is delayed another 7 days, a bone marrow assessment should be performed to \nassess cellularity and percentage of blasts. If marrow cellularity is <10%, treatment with SPRYCEL \nshould be interrupted until ANC >500/μL (0.5 x 109/L), at which time treatment may be resumed at \nfull dose. If marrow cellularity is >10%, resumption of treatment with SPRYCEL may be considered. \n \nNon-haematologic adverse reactions \nIf a moderate, grade 2, non-haematologic adverse reaction develops with dasatinib, treatment should \nbe interrupted until the adverse reaction has resolved or returned to baseline. The same dose should be \nresumed if this is the first occurrence and the dose should be reduced if this is a recurrent adverse \nreaction. If a severe grade 3 or 4, non-haematologic adverse reaction develops with dasatinib, \ntreatment must be withheld until the adverse reaction has resolved. Thereafter, treatment can be \nresumed as appropriate at a reduced dose depending on the initial severity of the adverse reaction. In \nCML-CP paediatric patients with non-haematologic adverse reactions, the dose reduction \nrecommendations for haematologic adverse reactions that are described above should be followed. In \nPh+ ALL paediatric patients with non-haematologic adverse reactions, if needed, one level of dose \n\n\n\n 42\n\nreduction should be followed, according to the dose reduction recommendations for haematologic \nadverse reactions that are described above. \n \nPleural effusion \nIf a pleural effusion is diagnosed, dasatinib should be interrupted until patient is examined, \nasymptomatic or has returned to baseline. If the episode does not improve within approximately one \nweek, a course of diuretics or corticosteroids or both concurrently should be considered (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8). Following resolution of the first episode, reintroduction of dasatinib at the same \ndose level should be considered. Following resolution of a subsequent episode, dasatinib at one dose \nlevel reduction should be reintroduced. Following resolution of a severe (grade 3 or 4) episode, \ntreatment can be resumed as appropriate at a reduced dose depending on the initial severity of the \nadverse reaction. \n \nDose reduction for concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \nThe concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and grapefruit juice with SPRYCEL should be \navoided (see section 4.5). If possible, an alternative concomitant medication with no or minimal \nenzyme inhibition potential should be selected. If SPRYCEL must be administered with a strong \nCYP3A4 inhibitor, consider a dose decrease to:  \n\n 40 mg daily for patients taking SPRYCEL 140 mg tablet daily. \n 20 mg daily for patients taking SPRYCEL 100 mg tablet daily. \n 20 mg daily for patients taking SPRYCEL 70 mg tablet daily. \n\n \nFor patients taking SPRYCEL 60 mg or 40 mg daily, consider interrupting the dose of SPRYCEL \nuntil the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, or switching to a lower dose with the powder for oral \nsuspension formulation. Allow a washout period of approximately 1 week after the inhibitor is stopped \nbefore reinitiating SPRYCEL.  \n \nThese reduced doses of SPRYCEL are predicted to adjust the area under the curve (AUC) to the range \nobserved without CYP3A4 inhibitors; however, clinical data are not available with these dose \nadjustments in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If SPRYCEL is not tolerated after dose \nreduction, either discontinue the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or interrupt SPRYCEL until the inhibitor is \ndiscontinued. Allow a washout period of approximately 1 week after the inhibitor is stopped before the \nSPRYCEL dose is increased. \n \nGuidelines for dose reduction for paediatric patients in whom SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension \nmust be administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor are shown in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Dose reduction for concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in paediatric \n\npatients \n Dose \nBody weight (kg) Original dose Dose reduction \nPowder for oral suspension \n5 to less than 10 4 mL (40 mg) 1 mL (10 mg) \n10 to less than 20 6 mL (60 mg) 1 mL (10 mg) \n20 to less than 30 9 mL (90 mg) 2 mL (20 mg) \n30 to less than 45 10.5 mL (105 mg) 2 mL (20 mg) \nat least 45 12 mL (120 mg) 2.5 mL (25 mg) \n\n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nNo clinically relevant age-related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in these patients. \nNo specific dose recommendation is necessary in elderly. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPatients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting \ndose. However, SPRYCEL should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n\n\n\n 43\n\n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinical studies were conducted with SPRYCEL in patients with decreased renal function (the \nstudy in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML excluded patients with serum creatinine \nconcentration > 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, and studies in patients with chronic phase \nCML with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy excluded patients with serum creatinine \nconcentration > 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range). Since the renal clearance of dasatinib \nand its metabolites is < 4%, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal \ninsufficiency. \n \nMethod of administration \nSPRYCEL must be administered orally. It can be taken with or without a meal and should be taken \nconsistently either in the morning or in the evening (see section 5.2). The oral suspension should not \nbe taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice (see section 4.5). Constituted oral suspension may be \nfurther mixed with milk, yogurt, apple juice, or applesauce. \n \nFor details on preparation and administration of this medicinal product and instructions for use, see \nsection 6.6.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinically relevant interactions \nDasatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Therefore, there is a \npotential for interaction with other concomitantly administered medicinal products that are \nmetabolised primarily by or modulate the activity of CYP3A4 (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products or substances that potently inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g. \nketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, telithromycin, grapefruit juice) \nmay increase exposure to dasatinib. Therefore, in patients receiving dasatinib, coadministration of a \npotent CYP3A4 inhibitor is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. dexamethasone, \nphenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital or herbal preparations containing Hypericum \nperforatum, also known as St. John's Wort) may substantially reduce exposure to dasatinib, potentially \nincreasing the risk of therapeutic failure. Therefore, in patients receiving dasatinib, coadministration of \nalternative medicinal products with less potential for CYP3A4 induction should be selected (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of dasatinib and a CYP3A4 substrate may increase exposure to the CYP3A4 \nsubstrate. Therefore, caution is warranted when dasatinib is coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates \nof narrow therapeutic index, such as astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil \nor ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) (see section 4.5). \n \nThe concomitant use of dasatinib and a histamine-2 (H2) antagonist (e.g. famotidine), proton pump \ninhibitor (e.g. omeprazole), or aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide may reduce the exposure \nto dasatinib. Thus, H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are not recommended and aluminium \nhydroxide/magnesium hydroxide products should be administered up to 2 hours prior to, or 2 hours \nfollowing the administration of dasatinib (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \nBased on the findings from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study, patients with mild, moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting dose (see section 5.2). Due to the \n\n\n\n 44\n\nlimitations of this clinical study, caution is recommended when administering dasatinib to patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nImportant adverse reactions \nMyelosuppression \nTreatment with dasatinib is associated with anaemia, neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia. Their \noccurrence is earlier and more frequent in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in \nchronic phase CML. In adult patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL treated with dasatinib as \nmonotherapy, complete blood counts (CBCs) should be performed weekly for the first 2 months, and \nthen monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. In adult and paediatric patients with chronic phase \nCML, complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, then every 3 months \nthereafter or as clinically indicated. In paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL treated with dasatinib in \ncombination with chemotherapy, CBCs should be performed prior to the start of each block of \nchemotherapy and as clinically indicated. During the consolidation blocks of chemotherapy, CBCs \nshould be performed every 2 days until recovery (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Myelosuppression is \ngenerally reversible and usually managed by withholding dasatinib temporarily or by dose reduction. \n \nBleeding \nIn patients with chronic phase CML (n=548), 5 patients (1%) receiving dasatinib had \ngrade 3 or 4 haemorrhage. In clinical studies in patients with advanced phase CML receiving the \nrecommended dose of SPRYCEL (n=304), severe central nervous system (CNS) haemorrhage \noccurred in 1% of patients. One case was fatal and was associated with Common Toxicity Criteria \n(CTC) grade 4 thrombocytopaenia. Grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred in 6% of \npatients with advanced phase CML and generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. \nOther grade 3 or 4 haemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients with advanced phase CML. Most bleeding \nrelated adverse reactions in these patients were typically associated with \ngrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopaenia (see section 4.8). Additionally, in vitro and in vivo platelet assays \nsuggest that SPRYCEL treatment reversibly affects platelet activation. \n \nCaution should be exercised if patients are required to take medicinal products that inhibit platelet \nfunction or anticoagulants. \n \nFluid retention \nDasatinib is associated with fluid retention. In the Phase III clinical study in patients with newly \ndiagnosed chronic phase CML, grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 13 patients (5%) in the \ndasatinib-treatment group and in 2 patients (1%) in the imatinib-treatment group after a minimum of \n60 months follow-up (see section 4.8). In all SPRYCEL treated patients with chronic phase CML, \nsevere fluid retention occurred in 32 patients (6%) receiving SPRYCEL at the recommended dose \n(n=548). In clinical studies in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL receiving SPRYCEL at \nthe recommended dose (n=304), grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 8% of patients, including \ngrade 3 or 4 pleural and pericardial effusion reported in 7% and 1% of patients, respectively. In these \npatients grade 3 or 4 pulmonary oedema and pulmonary hypertension were each reported in 1% of \npatients. \n \nPatients who develop symptoms suggestive of pleural effusion such as dyspnoea or dry cough should \nbe evaluated by chest X-ray. Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion may require thoracocentesis and oxygen \ntherapy. Fluid retention adverse reactions were typically managed by supportive care measures that \ninclude diuretics and short courses of steroids (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Patients aged 65 years and \nolder are more likely than younger patients to experience pleural effusion, dyspnoea, cough, \npericardial effusion and congestive heart failure, and should be monitored closely. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \nPAH (pre-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension confirmed by right heart catheterization) has been \nreported in association with dasatinib treatment (see section 4.8). In these cases, PAH was reported \nafter initiation of dasatinib therapy, including after more than one year of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n 45\n\nPatients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to \ninitiating dasatinib therapy. An echocardiography should be performed at treatment initiation in every \npatient presenting symptoms of cardiac disease and considered in patients with risk factors for cardiac \nor pulmonary disease. Patients who develop dyspnoea and fatigue after initiation of therapy should be \nevaluated for common etiologies including pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, anaemia, or lung \ninfiltration. In accordance with recommendations for management of non-haematologic adverse \nreactions (see section 4.2) the dose of dasatinib should be reduced or therapy interrupted during this \nevaluation. If no explanation is found, or if there is no improvement with dose reduction or \ninterruption, the diagnosis of PAH should be considered. The diagnostic approach should follow \nstandard practice guidelines. If PAH is confirmed, dasatinib should be permanently discontinued. \nFollow up should be performed according to standard practice guidelines. Improvements in \nhaemodynamic and clinical parameters have been observed in dasatinib-treated patients with PAH \nfollowing cessation of dasatinib therapy. \n \nQT Prolongation \nIn vitro data suggest that dasatinib has the potential to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation (QT \nInterval) (see section 5.3). In 258 dasatinib-treated patients and 258 imatinib-treated patients with a \nminimum of 60 months follow-up in the Phase III study in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, 1 \npatient (< 1%) in each group had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. The median \nchanges in QTcF from baseline were 3.0 msec in dasatinib-treated patients compared to 8.2 msec in \nimatinib-treated patients. One patient (< 1%) in each group experienced a QTcF > 500 msec. In \n865 patients with leukaemia treated with dasatinib in Phase II clinical studies, the mean changes from \nbaseline in QTc interval using Fridericia's method (QTcF) were 4 - 6 msec; the upper 95% confidence \nintervals for all mean changes from baseline were < 7 msec (see section 4.8).  \nOf the 2,182 patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy who received dasatinib in \nclinical studies, 15 (1%) had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. Twenty-one of these \npatients (1%) experienced a QTcF > 500 msec.  \n \nDasatinib should be administered with caution to patients who have or may develop prolongation of \nQTc. These include patients with hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, patients with congenital long \nQT syndrome, patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products or other medicinal products which \nlead to QT prolongation, and cumulative high dose anthracycline therapy. Hypokalaemia or \nhypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to dasatinib administration. \n \nCardiac adverse reactions \nDasatinib was studied in a randomised clinical study of 519 patients with newly diagnosed CML in \nchronic phase which included patients with prior cardiac disease. The cardiac adverse reactions of \ncongestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction, pericardial effusion, arrhythmias, palpitations, QT \nprolongation and myocardial infarction (including fatal) were reported in patients taking dasatinib. \nCardiac adverse reactions were more frequent in patients with risk factors or a history of cardiac \ndisease. Patients with risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes) or a history of cardiac \ndisease (e.g. prior percutaneous coronary intervention, documented coronary artery disease) should be \nmonitored carefully for clinical signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction such as chest \npain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. \n \nIf these clinical signs or symptoms develop, physicians are advised to interrupt dasatinib \nadministration and consider the need for alternative CML-specific treatment. After resolution, a \nfunctional assessment should be performed prior to resuming treatment with dasatinib. Dasatinib may \nbe resumed at the original dose for mild/moderate adverse reactions (≤ grade 2) and resumed at a dose \nlevel reduction for severe adverse reactions (≥ grade 3) (see section 4.2). Patients continuing treatment \nshould be monitored periodically. \n \nPatients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease were not included in the clinical \nstudies. \n \n\n\n\n 46\n\nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \nBCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), \nincluding individual case reports for SPRYCEL (see section 4.8). If laboratory or clinical findings \nassociated with TMA occur in a patient receiving SPRYCEL, treatment with SPRYCEL should be \ndiscontinued and thorough evaluation for TMA, including ADAMTS13 activity and anti-\nADAMTS13-antibody determination, should be completed. If anti-ADAMTS13-antibody is elevated \nin conjunction with low ADAMTS13 activity, treatment with SPRYCEL should not be resumed. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these \npatients received BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or \nfulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome.  \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with SPRYCEL. Experts in \nliver disease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in \npatients with positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who \ntest positive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with \nSPRYCEL should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout \ntherapy and for several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). \n \nEffects on growth and development in paediatric patients \nIn paediatric trials of SPRYCEL in imatinib-resistant/intolerant Ph+ CML-CP paediatric patients and \ntreatment-naive Ph+ CML-CP paediatric patients after at least 2 years of treatment, treatment-related \nadverse events associated with bone growth and development were reported in 6 (4.6%) patients, one \nof which was severe in intensity (Growth Retardation Grade 3). These 6 cases included cases of \nepiphyses delayed fusion, osteopaenia, growth retardation, and gynecomastia (see section 5.1). These \nresults are difficult to interpret in the context of chronic diseases such as CML, and require long-term \nfollow-up. \n \nIn paediatric trials of SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL \npaediatric patients after a maximum of 2 years of treatment, treatment-related adverse events \nassociated with bone growth and development were reported in 1 (0.6%) patient. This case was a \nGrade 1 osteopenia. \n \nExcipients \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains 2.1 mg sodium per mL of SPRYCEL oral suspension. At the \nmaximum daily dose of 16 mL oral suspension, this is equivalent to 1.7% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily dietary intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nSucrose \nSPRYCEL powder for oral suspension contains approximately 0.29 g/mL of sucrose upon constitution \nwith water. For the recommended paediatric dosage, SPRYCEL oral suspension contains 1.17 grams \nsucrose per 40 mg dasatinib and 4.37 grams sucrose per 150 mg dasatinib. This should be taken into \naccount in patients with diabetes mellitus.  \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or \nsucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product. \nMay be harmful to the teeth. \n \nBenzoic acid and benzoates \nSPRYCEL contains 0.25 mg benzoic acid in each mL of oral suspension and 0.25 mg sodium \nbenzoate in each mL of oral suspension. \nBenzoic acid/Benzoate salt may increase jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies \n(up to 4 weeks old). \n \nBenzyl alcohol \nSPRYCEL contains 0.017 mg benzyl alcohol in each mL of oral suspension.  \nBenzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n\n\n\n 47\n\n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nSPRYCEL should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with dasatinib (see section 4.6). Advise patients who are or may become pregnant of the \npotential risk to the foetus from dasatinib and the excipient benzyl alcohol, which may accumulate \nover time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \nUse with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, as benzyl alcohol may accumulate over \ntime and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \nSulphur dioxide (E220) \nMay rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nActive substances that may increase dasatinib plasma concentrations \nIn vitro studies indicate that dasatinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of dasatinib and \nmedicinal products or substances which potently inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nerythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, telithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase exposure to \ndasatinib. Therefore, in patients receiving dasatinib, systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor is not recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nAt clinically relevant concentrations, binding of dasatinib to plasma proteins is approximately 96% on \nthe basis of in vitro experiments. No studies have been performed to evaluate dasatinib interaction \nwith other protein-bound medicinal products. The potential for displacement and its clinical relevance \nare unknown. \n \nActive substances that may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations \nWhen dasatinib was administered following 8 daily evening administrations of 600 mg rifampicin, a \npotent CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of dasatinib was decreased by 82%. Other medicinal products that \ninduce CYP3A4 activity (e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or herbal \npreparations containing Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. John´s Wort) may also increase \nmetabolism and decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant use of potent \nCYP3A4 inducers with dasatinib is not recommended. In patients in whom rifampicin or other \nCYP3A4 inducers are indicated, alternative medicinal products with less enzyme induction potential \nshould be used. Concomitant use of dexamethasone, a weak CYP3A4 inducer, with dasatinib is \nallowed; dasatinib AUC is predicted to decrease approximately 25% with concomitant use of \ndexamethasone, which is not likely to be clinically meaningful. \n \nHistamine-2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors \nLong-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (e.g. \nfamotidine and omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. In a single-dose study in healthy \nsubjects, the administration of famotidine 10 hours prior to a single dose of SPRYCEL reduced \ndasatinib exposure by 61%. In a study of 14 healthy subjects, administration of a single 100-mg dose \nof SPRYCEL 22 hours following a 4-day, 40-mg omeprazole dose at steady state reduced the AUC of \ndasatinib by 43% and the Cmax of dasatinib by 42%. The use of antacids should be considered in place \nof H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving SPRYCEL therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nAntacids \nNon-clinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH-dependent. In healthy subjects, the \nconcomitant use of aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide antacids with SPRYCEL reduced the \nAUC of a single dose of SPRYCEL by 55% and the Cmax by 58%. However, when antacids were \nadministered 2 hours prior to a single dose of SPRYCEL, no relevant changes in dasatinib \nconcentration or exposure were observed. Thus, antacids may be administered up to 2 hours prior to or \n2 hours following SPRYCEL (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 48\n\nActive substances that may have their plasma concentrations altered by dasatinib \nConcomitant use of dasatinib and a CYP3A4 substrate may increase exposure to the CYP3A4 \nsubstrate. In a study in healthy subjects, a single 100 mg dose of dasatinib increased AUC and Cmax \nexposure to simvastatin, a known CYP3A4 substrate, by 20 and 37% respectively. It cannot be \nexcluded that the effect is larger after multiple doses of dasatinib. Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates \nknown to have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, \nquinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids [ergotamine, dihydroergotamine]) should be administered with \ncaution in patients receiving dasatinib (see section 4.4). \nIn vitro data indicate a potential risk for interaction with CYP2C8 substrates, such as glitazones. \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females \nBoth sexually active men and women of childbearing potential should use effective methods of \ncontraception during treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nBased on human experience, dasatinib is suspected to cause congenital malformations including neural \ntube defects, and harmful pharmacological effects on the foetus when administered during pregnancy. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \nSPRYCEL should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with dasatinib. If SPRYCEL is used during pregnancy, the patient must be informed of the \npotential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere is insufficient/limited information on the excretion of dasatinib in human or animal breast milk. \nPhysico-chemical and available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data on dasatinib point to excretion in \nbreast milk and a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. \nBreast-feeding should be stopped during treatment with SPRYCEL. \n \nPregnant or breast-feeding women should avoid exposure to SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension. \n \nFertility \nIn animal studies, the fertility of male and female rats was not affected by treatment with dasatinib \n(see section 5.3). Physicians and other healthcare providers should counsel male patients of \nappropriate age about possible effects of SPRYCEL on fertility, and this counseling may include \nconsideration of semen deposition. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSPRYCEL has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised \nthat they may experience adverse reactions such as dizziness or blurred vision during treatment with \ndasatinib. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe data described below reflect the exposure to SPRYCEL as single-agent therapy at all doses tested \nin clinical studies (N=2,900), including 324 adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, \n2,388 adult patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic or advanced phase CML or Ph+ \nALL, and 188 paediatric patients. \n \nIn the 2,712 adult patients with either chronic phase CML, advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, the \nmedian duration of therapy was 19.2 months (range 0 to 93.2 months). In a randomized trial in patients \n\n\n\n 49\n\nwith newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, the median duration of therapy was approximately 60 \nmonths. The median duration of therapy in 1,618 adult patients with chronic phase CML was \n29 months (range 0 to 92.9 months). The median duration of therapy in 1,094 adult patients with \nadvanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL was 6.2 months (range 0 to 93.2 months). Among 188 patients in \npaediatric studies, the median duration of therapy was 26.3 months (range 0 to 99.6 months). In the \nsubset of 130 chronic phase CML SPRYCEL-treated paediatric patients, the median duration of \ntherapy was 42.3 months (range 0.1 to 99.6 months). \n \nThe majority of SPRYCEL-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some time. In the overall \npopulation of 2,712 SPRYCEL-treated adult subjects, 520 (19%) experienced adverse reactions \nleading to treatment discontinuation. \n \nThe overall safety profile of SPRYCEL in the paediatric Ph+ CML-CP population was similar to that \nof the adult population, regardless of formulation, with the exception of no reported pericardial \neffusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema, or pulmonary hypertension in the paediatric population. \nOf the 130 SPRYCEL-treated paediatric subjects with CML-CP, 2 (1.5%) experienced adverse \nreactions leading to treatment discontinuation. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions, excluding laboratory abnormalities, were reported in patients treated \nwith SPRYCEL used as single-agent therapy in clinical studies and post-marketing experience \n(Table 5). These reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available

Their \noccurrence is earlier and more frequent in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in \nchronic phase CML (see section 4.4).  \n \nBleeding \nBleeding drug-related adverse reactions, ranging from petechiae and epistaxis to \ngrade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal haemorrhage and CNS bleeding, were reported in patients taking \nSPRYCEL (see section 4.4). \n \nFluid retention \nMiscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and pericardial \neffusion with or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as “fluid retention”. In the \nnewly diagnosed chronic phase CML study after a minimum of 60 months follow-up, dasatinib-related \nfluid retention adverse reactions included pleural effusion (28%), superficial oedema (14%), \n\n\n\n 52\n\npulmonary hypertension (5%), generalised oedema (4%), and pericardial effusion (4%). Congestive \nheart failure/cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary oedema were reported in < 2% of patients. \nThe cumulative rate of dasatinib-related pleural effusion (all grades) over time was 10% at 12 months, \n14% at 24 months, 19% at 36 months, 24% at 48 months and 28% at 60 months. A total of 46 \ndasatinib-treated patients had recurrent pleural effusions. Seventeen patients had 2 separate adverse \nreactions, 6 had 3 adverse reactions, 18 had 4 to 8 adverse reactions and 5 had > 8 episodes of pleural \neffusions. \n \nThe median time to first dasatinib-related grade 1 or 2 pleural effusion was 114 weeks (range: 4 to \n299 weeks). Less than 10% of patients with pleural effusion had severe (grade 3 or 4) dasatinib-related \npleural effusions. The median time to first occurrence of grade ≥ 3 dasatinib-related pleural effusion \nwas 175 weeks (range: 114 to 274 weeks). The median duration of dasatinib-related pleural effusion \n(all grades) was 283 days (~40 weeks). \nPleural effusion was usually reversible and managed by interrupting SPRYCEL treatment and using \ndiuretics or other appropriate supportive care measures (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Among \ndasatinib-treated patients with drug-related pleural effusion (n=73), 45 (62%) had dose interruptions \nand 30 (41%) had dose reductions. Additionally, 34 (47%) received diuretics, 23 (32%) received \ncorticosteroids, and 20 (27%) received both corticosteroids and diuretics. Nine (12%) patients \nunderwent therapeutic thoracentesis. \nSix percent of dasatinib-treated patients discontinued treatment due to drug-related pleural effusion. \nPleural effusion did not impair the ability of patients to obtain a response. Among the dasatinib-treated \npatients with pleural effusion, 96% achieved a cCCyR, 82% achieved a MMR, and 50% achieved a \nMR4.5 despite dose interruptions or dose adjustment. \nSee section 4.4 for further information on patients with chronic phase CML and advanced phase CML \nor Ph+ ALL. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \nPAH (pre-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension confirmed by right heart catheterization) has been \nreported in association with dasatinib exposure. In these cases, PAH was reported after initiation of \ndasatinib therapy, including after more than one year of treatment. Patients with PAH reported during \ndasatinib treatment were often taking concomitant medicinal products or had co-morbidities in \naddition to the underlying malignancy. Improvements in haemodynamic and clinical parameters have \nbeen observed in patients with PAH following discontinuation of dasatinib. \n \nQT Prolongation \nIn the Phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, one patient (< 1%) of the \nSPRYCEL-treated patients had a QTcF > 500 msec after a minimum of 12 months follow-up (see \nsection 4.4). No additional patients were reported to have QTcF > 500 msec after a minimum of \n60 months follow-up. \nIn 5 Phase II clinical studies in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy, \nrepeated baseline and on-treatment ECGs were obtained at pre-specified time points and read centrally \nfor 865 patients receiving SPRYCEL 70 mg twice daily. QT interval was corrected for heart rate by \nFridericia's method. At all post-dose time points on day 8, the mean changes from baseline in QTcF \ninterval were 4 - 6 msec, with associated upper 95% confidence intervals < 7 msec. Of the \n2,182 patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy who received SPRYCEL in \nclinical studies, 15 (1%) had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. Twenty-one patients \n(1%) experienced a QTcF > 500 msec (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiac adverse reactions \nPatients with risk factors or a history of cardiac disease should be monitored carefully for signs or \nsymptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction and should be evaluated and treated appropriately (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nHepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in \nacute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n\n\n 53\n\n \nIn the Phase III dose-optimisation study in patients with chronic phase CML with resistance or \nintolerance to prior imatinib therapy (median duration of treatment of 30 months), the incidence of \npleural effusion and congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction was lower in patients treated with \nSPRYCEL 100 mg once daily than in those treated with SPRYCEL 70 mg twice daily. \nMyelosuppression was also reported less frequently in the 100 mg once daily treatment group (see \nLaboratory test abnormalities below). The median duration of therapy in the 100 mg once daily group \nwas 37 months (range 1-91 months). Cumulative rates of selected adverse reactions that were reported \nin the 100 mg once daily recommended starting dose are shown in Table 6a. \n \nTable 6a: Selected adverse reactions reported in a phase 3 dose optimisation study (imatinib \n\nintolerant or resistant chronic phase CML)a \n\n Minimum of 2 years follow up \nMinimum of 5 years \n\nfollow up \nMinimum of 7 years \n\nfollow up \n All \n\ngrades \nGrade \n\n3/4 \nAll \n\ngrades \nGrade \n\n3/4 \nAll \n\ngrades \nGrade \n\n3/4 \nPreferred term Percent (%) of patients \nDiarrhoea 27 2 28 2 28 2 \nFluid retention 34 4 42 6 48 7 \n Superficial oedema 18 0 21 0 22 0 \n Pleural effusion 18 2 24 4 28 5 \n Generalised oedema 3 0 4 0 4 0 \n Pericardial effusion 2 1 2 1 3 1 \n Pulmonary \n\nhypertension 0 0 0 0 2 1 \n\nHaemorrhage 11 1 11 1 12 1 \n Gastrointestinal \n\nbleeding 2 1 2 1 2 1 \na Phase 3 dose optimisation study results reported in recommended starting dose of 100 mg once daily (n=165) population \n \nIn the Phase III dose-optimisation study in patients with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL, the \nmedian duration of treatment was 14 months for accelerated phase CML, 3 months for myeloid blast \nCML, 4 months for lymphoid blast CML and 3 months for Ph+ ALL. Selected adverse reactions that \nwere reported in the recommended starting dose of 140 mg once daily are shown in Table 6b. A 70 mg \ntwice daily regimen was also studied.

In the pivotal study, 106 paediatric \npatients received SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy on a continuous dosing regimen. In a \nsupportive study, of 55 paediatric patients, 35 received SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy \non a discontinuous dosing regimen (two weeks on treatment followed by one to two weeks off) and \n20 received SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy on a continuous dosing regimen. Among \nthe 126 Ph+ ALL paediatric patients treated with SPRYCEL on a continuous dosing regimen, the \nmedian duration of therapy was 23.6 months (range 1.4 to 33 months).  \n \nOf the 126 Ph+ ALL paediatric patients on a continuous dosing regimen, 2 (1.6%) experienced \nadverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation. Adverse reactions reported in these two \npaediatric studies at a frequency of 10% in patients on a continuous dosing regimen are shown in \nTable 7. Of note, pleural effusion was reported in 7 (5.6%) patients in this group, and is therefore not \nincluded in the table. \n \n\nTable 7: Adverse reactions reported in ≥10% of paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL treated \nwith SPRYCEL on a continuous dosing regimen in combination with chemotherapy \n(N=126)a \n\n Percent (%) of patients \nAdverse reaction All grades Grade 3/4 \n\nFebrile neutropaenia 27.0 26.2 \nNausea 20.6 5.6 \nVomiting 20.6 4.8 \nAbdominal pain 14.3 3.2 \nDiarrhoea 12.7 4.8 \nPyrexia 12.7 5.6 \nHeadache 11.1 4.8 \nDecreased appetite 10.3 4.8 \nFatigue 10.3 0 \n\na In the pivotal study, among 106 total patients, 24 patients received the powder for oral suspension at least once, 8 of whom \nreceived the powder for oral suspension formulation exclusively. \n\n\n\n 55\n\n \nLaboratory test abnormalities \nHaematology  \nIn the Phase III newly diagnosed chronic phase CML study, the following grade 3 or 4 laboratory \nabnormalities were reported after a minimum of 12 months follow-up in patients taking SPRYCEL: \nneutropaenia (21%), thrombocytopaenia (19%), and anaemia (10%). After a minimum of 60 months \nfollow-up, the cumulative rates of neutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia, and anaemia were 29%, 22% and \n13%, respectively. \n \nIn SPRYCEL-treated patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML who experienced \ngrade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following brief dose interruptions and/or \nreductions and permanent discontinuation of treatment occurred in 1.6% of patients after a minimum \nof 12 months follow-up. After a minimum of 60 months follow-up the cumulative rate of permanent \ndiscontinuation due to grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was 2.3%. \n \nIn patients with CML with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy, cytopaenias \n(thrombocytopaenia, neutropaenia, and anaemia) were a consistent finding. However, the occurrence \nof cytopaenias was also clearly dependent on the stage of the disease.

Most patients continued treatment without further evidence of myelosuppression. \n \nBiochemistry  \nIn the newly diagnosed chronic phase CML study, grade 3 or 4 hypophosphataemia was reported in \n4% of SPRYCEL-treated patients, and grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases, creatinine, and \nbilirubin were reported in ≤ 1% of patients after a minimum of 12 months follow-up. After a minimum \nof 60 months follow-up the cumulative rate of grade 3 or 4 hypophosphataemia was 7%, \ngrade 3 or 4 elevations of creatinine and bilirubin was 1% and grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases \nremained 1%. There were no discontinuations of SPRYCEL therapy due to these biochemical \nlaboratory parameters. \n \n2 year follow-up \nGrade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in 1% of patients with chronic \nphase CML (resistant or intolerant to imatinib), but elevations were reported with an increased \nfrequency of 1 to 7% of patients with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL. It was usually managed \nwith dose reduction or interruption. In the Phase III dose-optimisation study in chronic phase CML, \n\n\n\n 56\n\ngrade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in ≤ 1% of patients with similar \nlow incidence in the four treatment groups. In the Phase III dose-optimisation study in advanced phase \nCML and Ph+ALL, grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in 1% to 5% of \npatients across treatment groups. \n \nApproximately 5% of the SPRYCEL-treated patients who had normal baseline levels experienced \ngrade 3 or 4 transient hypocalcaemia at some time during the course of the study. In general, there was \nno association of decreased calcium with clinical symptoms. Patients developing \ngrade 3 or 4 hypocalcaemia often had recovery with oral calcium supplementation. \nGrade 3 or 4 hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, and hypophosphataemia were reported in patients with all \nphases of CML but were reported with an increased frequency in patients with myeloid or lymphoid \nblast phase CML and Ph+ ALL. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in creatinine were reported in < 1% of \npatients with chronic phase CML and were reported with an increased frequency of 1 to 4% of patients \nwith advanced phase CML. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety profile of SPRYCEL administered as single-agent therapy in paediatric patients with \nPh+ CML-CP was comparable to the safety profile in adults.  \n \nThe safety profile of SPRYCEL administered in combination with chemotherapy in paediatric patients \nwith Ph+ ALL was consistent with the known safety profile of SPRYCEL in adults and the expected \neffects of chemotherapy, with the exception of a lower pleural effusion rate in paediatric patients as \ncompared to adults. \n \nIn the paediatric CML studies, the rates of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known \nprofile for laboratory parameters in adults. \n \nIn the paediatric ALL studies, the rates of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known \nprofile for laboratory parameters in adults, within the context of an acute leukaemia patient receiving a \nbackground chemotherapy regimen. \n \nSpecial population \nWhile the safety profile of SPRYCEL in elderly was similar to that in the younger population, patients \naged 65 years and older are more likely to experience the commonly reported adverse reactions such \nas fatigue, pleural effusion, dyspnoea, cough, lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and appetite \ndisturbance and more likely to experience less frequently reported adverse reactions such as \nabdominal distention, dizziness, pericardial effusion, congestive heart failure, and weight decrease and \nshould be monitored closely (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience with overdose of SPRYCEL in clinical studies is limited to isolated cases. The highest \noverdose of 280 mg per day for one week was reported in two patients and both developed a \nsignificant decrease in platelet counts. Since dasatinib is associated with \ngrade 3 or 4 myelosuppression (see section 4.4), patients who ingest more than the recommended dose \nshould be closely monitored for myelosuppression and given appropriate supportive treatment. \n \n \n\n\n\n 57\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE06 \n \nPharmacodynamics \nDasatinib inhibits the activity of the BCR-ABL kinase and SRC family kinases along with a number of \nother selected oncogenic kinases including c-KIT, ephrin (EPH) receptor kinases, and PDGFβ \nreceptor. Dasatinib is a potent, subnanomolar inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase with potency at \nconcentration of 0.6-0.8 nM. It binds to both the inactive and active conformations of the BCR-ABL \nenzyme. \n \nMechanism of action \nIn vitro, dasatinib is active in leukaemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib-sensitive and \nresistant disease. These non-clinical studies show that dasatinib can overcome imatinib resistance \nresulting from BCR-ABL overexpression, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate \nsignalling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multidrug resistance gene \noverexpression. Additionally, dasatinib inhibits SRC family kinases at subnanomolar concentrations. \n \nIn vivo, in separate experiments using murine models of CML, dasatinib prevented the progression of \nchronic CML to blast phase and prolonged the survival of mice bearing patient-derived CML cell lines \ngrown at various sites, including the central nervous system. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn the Phase I study, haematologic and cytogenetic responses were observed in all phases of CML and \nin Ph+ ALL in the first 84 patients treated and followed for up to 27 months. Responses were durable \nacross all phases of CML and Ph+ ALL.  \n \nFour single-arm, uncontrolled, open-label Phase II clinical studies were conducted to determine the \nsafety and efficacy of dasatinib in patients with CML in chronic, accelerated, or myeloid blast phase, \nwho were either resistant or intolerant to imatinib. One randomised non-comparative study was \nconducted in chronic phase patients who failed initial treatment with 400 or 600 mg imatinib. The \nstarting dose was 70 mg dasatinib twice daily. Dose modifications were allowed for improving activity \nor management of toxicity (see section 4.2). \nTwo randomised, open-label Phase III studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dasatinib \nadministered once daily compared with dasatinib administered twice daily. In addition, one \nopen-label, randomised, comparative Phase III study was conducted in adult patients with newly \ndiagnosed chronic phase CML. \n \nThe efficacy of dasatinib is based on haematological and cytogenetic response rates. \nDurability of response and estimated survival rates provide additional evidence of dasatinib clinical \nbenefit. \n \nA total of 2,712 patients were evaluated in clinical studies; of these 23% were ≥ 65 years of age and \n5% were ≥ 75 years of age.  \n \nChronic phase CML - Newly diagnosed \nAn international open-label, multicentre, randomised, comparative Phase III study was conducted in \nadult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML. Patients were randomised to receive either \nSPRYCEL 100 mg once daily or imatinib 400 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was the rate of \nconfirmed complete cytogenetic response (cCCyR) within 12 months. Secondary endpoints included \ntime in cCCyR (measure of durability of response), time to cCCyR, major molecular response (MMR) \nrate, time to MMR, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Other relevant efficacy \nresults included CCyR and complete molecular response (CMR) rates. The study is ongoing. \n \n\n\n\n 58\n\nA total of 519 patients were randomised to a treatment group: 259 to SPRYCEL and 260 to imatinib. \nBaseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups with respect to age \n(median age was 46 years for the SPRYCEL group and 49 years for the imatinib group with 10% and \n11% of patients 65 years of age or older, respectively), gender (women 44% and 37%, respectively), \nand race (Caucasian 51% and 55%; Asian 42% and 37%, respectively). At baseline, the distribution of \nHasford Scores was similar in the SPRYCEL and imatinib treatment groups (low risk: 33% and 34%; \nintermediate risk 48% and 47%; high risk: 19% and 19%, respectively).  \nWith a minimum of 12 months follow-up, 85% of patients randomised to the SPRYCEL group and \n81% of patients randomised to the imatinib group were still receiving first-line treatment. \nDiscontinuation within 12 months due to disease progression occurred in 3% of SPRYCEL-treated \npatients and 5% of imatinib-treated patients. \n \nWith a minimum of 60 months follow-up, 60% of patients randomised to the SPRYCEL group and \n63% of patients randomised to the imatinib group were still receiving first-line treatment. \nDiscontinuation within 60 months due to disease progression occurred in 11% of SPRYCEL-treated \npatients and 14% of imatinib-treated patients. \n \nEfficacy results are presented in Table 9. A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in \nthe SPRYCEL group achieved a cCCyR compared with patients in the imatinib group within the first \n12 months of treatment. Efficacy of SPRYCEL was consistently demonstrated across different \nsubgroups, including age, gender, and baseline Hasford score.  \n\n\n\n 59\n\nTable 9: Efficacy results from a phase 3 study of newly diagnosed patients with chronic \nphase CML  \n\n SPRYCEL \nn= 259 \n\nimatinib \nn= 260 \n\np-value \n\n Response rate (95% CI)  \nCytogenetic response    \n\nwithin 12 months    \n cCCyRa  76.8% (71.2–81.8) 66.2% (60.1–71.9) p< 0.007* \n CCyRb 85.3% (80.4-89.4) 73.5% (67.7-78.7)  \n\nwithin 24 months    \ncCCyRa 80.3% 74.2%  \nCCyRb 87.3% 82.3%  \n\nwithin 36 months    \ncCCyRa 82.6% 77.3%  \nCCyRb 88.0% 83.5%  \n\nwithin 48 months    \ncCCyRa 82.6% 78.5%  \nCCyRb 87.6% 83.8%  \n\nwithin 60 months    \ncCCyRa 83.0% 78.5%  \nCCyRb 88.0% 83.8%  \n\nMajor molecular responsec    \n12 months 52.1% (45.9–58.3) 33.8% (28.1–39.9) p< 0.00003* \n24 months 64.5% (58.3-70.3) 50% (43.8-56.2)  \n36 months 69.1% (63.1-74.7) 56.2% (49.9-62.3)  \n48 months 75.7% (70.0-80.8) 62.7% (56.5-68.6)  \n60 months 76.4% (70.8-81.5) 64.2% (58.1-70.1) p=0.0021 \n\n Hazard ratio (HR)  \n within 12 months (99.99% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.55 (1.0-2.3) p< 0.0001* \nTime-to MMR 2.01 (1.2-3.4) p< 0.0001* \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.7 (0.4-1.4) p< 0.035 \n within 24 months (95% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.49 (1.22-1.82)  \nTime-to MMR 1.69 (1.34-2.12)  \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.77 (0.55-1.10)  \n within 36 months (95% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.48 (1.22-1.80)  \nTime-to MMR 1.59 (1.28-1.99)  \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.77 (0.53-1.11)  \n within 48 months (95% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.45 (1.20-1.77)  \nTime-to MMR 1.55 (1.26-1.91)  \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.81 (0.56-1.17)  \n within 60 months (95% CI)  \n\nTime-to cCCyR 1.46 (1.20-1.77) p=0.0001 \nTime-to MMR 1.54 (1.25-1.89) p<0.0001 \n\nDurability of cCCyR 0.79 (0.55-1.13) p=0.1983 \na Confirmed complete cytogenetic response (cCCyR) is defined as a response noted on two consecutive occasions (at least \n\n28 days apart). \nb Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) is based on a single bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation. \nc Major molecular response (at any time) was defined as BCR ABL ratios ≤ 0.1% by RQ PCR in peripheral blood samples \n\nstandardised on the International scale.

They were randomised (2:1) to either dasatinib (70 mg \ntwice daily) or imatinib (400 mg twice daily). Crossover to the alternative treatment arm was allowed \nif patients showed evidence of disease progression or intolerance that could not be managed by dose \nmodification. The primary endpoint was MCyR at 12 weeks. Results are available for 150 patients: \n101 were randomised to dasatinib and 49 to imatinib (all imatinib-resistant). The median time from \ndiagnosis to randomisation was 64 months in the dasatinib group and 52 months in the imatinib group. \nAll patients were extensively pretreated. Prior complete haematologic response (CHR) to imatinib was \n\nPR\nO\n\nPO\nR\n\nTI\nO\n\nN\n A\n\nLI\nV\n\nE \n\n\n\n 64\n\nachieved in 93% of the overall patient population. A prior MCyR to imatinib was achieved in 28% and \n29% of the patients in the dasatinib and imatinib arms, respectively. \nMedian duration of treatment was 23 months for dasatinib (with 44% of patients treated for \n> 24 months to date) and 3 months for imatinib (with 10% of patients treated for > 24 months to date). \nNinety-three percent of patients in the dasatinib arm and 82% of patients in the imatinib arm achieved \na CHR prior to crossover. \n \nAt 3 months, a MCyR occurred more often in the dasatinib arm (36%) than in the imatinib arm (29%). \nNotably, 22% of patients reported a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in the dasatinib arm while \nonly 8% achieved a CCyR in the imatinib arm. With longer treatment and follow-up (median of \n24 months), MCyR was achieved in 53% of the dasatinib-treated patients (CCyR in 44%) and 33% of \nthe imatinib-treated patients (CCyR in 18%) prior to crossover. Among patients who had received \nimatinib 400 mg prior to study entry, MCyR was achieved in 61% of patients in the dasatinib arm and \n50% in the imatinib arm. \nBased on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, the proportion of patients who maintained MCyR for 1 year was \n92% (95% CI: [85%-100%]) for dasatinib (CCyR 97%, 95% CI: [92%-100%]) and 74% (95% CI: \n[49%-100%]) for imatinib (CCyR 100%). The proportion of patients who maintained MCyR for \n18 months was 90% (95% CI: [82%-98%]) for dasatinib (CCyR 94%, 95% CI: [87%-100%]) and 74% \n(95% CI: [49%-100%]) for imatinib (CCyR 100%). \n \nBased on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, the proportion of patients who had progression-free survival \n(PFS) for 1 year was 91% (95% CI: [85%-97%]) for dasatinib and 73% (95% CI: [54%-91%]) for \nimatinib. The proportion of patients who had PFS at 2 years was 86% (95% CI: [78%-93%]) for \ndasatinib and 65% (95% CI: [43%-87%]) for imatinib. \n \nA total of 43% of the patients in the dasatinib arm, and 82% in the imatinib arm had treatment failure, \ndefined as disease progression or cross-over to the other treatment (lack of response, intolerance of \nstudy medicinal product, etc.). \n \nThe rate of major molecular response (defined as BCR-ABL/control transcripts ≤ 0.1% by RQ-PCR in \nperipheral blood samples) prior to crossover was 29% for dasatinib and 12% for imatinib. \n \nStudy 2 \nAn open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients resistant or intolerant to \nimatinib (i.e. patients who experienced significant toxicity during treatment with imatinib that \nprecluded further treatment). \nA total of 387 patients received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (288 resistant and 99 intolerant). The \nmedian time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 61 months. The majority of the patients (53%) \nhad received prior imatinib treatment for more than 3 years. Most resistant patients (72%) had \nreceived > 600 mg imatinib. In addition to imatinib, 35% of patients had received prior cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, 65% had received prior interferon, and 10% had received a prior stem cell transplant. \nThirty-eight percent of patients had baseline mutations known to confer imatinib resistance. Median \nduration of treatment on dasatinib was 24 months with 51% of patients treated for > 24 months to date. \nEfficacy results are reported in Table 11. MCyR was achieved in 55% of imatinib-resistant patients \nand 82% of imatinib-intolerant patients. With a minimum of 24 months follow-up, 21 of the \n240 patients who had achieved a MCyR had progressed and the median duration of MCyR had not \nbeen reached. \n \nBased on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, 95% (95% CI: [92%-98%]) of the patients maintained MCyR \nfor 1 year and 88% (95% CI: [83%-93%]) maintained MCyR for 2 years. The proportion of patients \nwho maintained CCyR for 1 year was 97% (95% CI: [94%-99%]) and for 2 years was 90% (95% CI: \n[86%-95%]). Forty-two percent of the imatinib-resistant patients with no prior MCyR to imatinib \n(n= 188) achieved a MCyR with dasatinib. \nThere were 45 different BCR-ABL mutations in 38% of patients enrolled in this study. Complete \nhaematologic response or MCyR was achieved in patients harbouring a variety of BCR-ABL \nmutations associated with imatinib resistance except T315I. The rates of MCyR at 2 years were similar \n\n\n\n 65\n\nwhether patients had any baseline BCR-ABL mutation, P-loop mutation, or no mutation (63%, 61% \nand 62%, respectively). \n \nAmong imatinib-resistant patients, the estimated rate of PFS was 88% (95% CI: [84%-92%]) at 1 year \nand 75% (95% CI: [69%-81%]) at 2 years. Among imatinib-intolerant patients, the estimated rate of \nPFS was 98% (95% CI: [95%-100%]) at 1 year and 94% (95% CI: [88%-99%]) at 2 years. \n \nThe rate of major molecular response at 24 months was 45% (35% for imatinib-resistant patients and \n74% for imatinib-intolerant patients). \n \nAccelerated phase CML \nAn open-label, single-arm, multicentre study was conducted in patients intolerant or resistant to \nimatinib. A total of 174 patients received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (161 resistant and 13 intolerant \nto imatinib). The median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was 82 months. Median duration of \ntreatment on dasatinib was 14 months with 31% of patients treated for > 24 months to date. The rate of \nmajor molecular response (assessed in 41 patients with a CCyR) was 46% at 24 months.

After 24 months of follow-up, \nOS in newly diagnosed patients was 100%, and 96.6% in imatinib-resistant or intolerant patients. \nIn the Phase II paediatric study, 1 newly diagnosed patient and 2 imatinib-resistant or intolerant \npatients progressed to blast phase CML. \n \nThere were 33 newly diagnosed paediatric patients with CML-CP who received SPRYCEL powder \nfor oral suspension at a dose of 72 mg/m2. This dose represents 30% lower exposure compared to the \nrecommended dose (see section 5.2). In these patients, CCyR and MMR were CCyR: 87.9% [95% CI: \n(71.8-96.6)] and MMR: 45.5% [95% CI: (28.1-63.6)] at 12 months. \n \nAmong dasatinib-treated CML-CP paediatric patients previously exposed to imatinib, the mutations \ndetected at the end of treatment were: T315A, E255K and F317L. However, E255K and F317L were \nalso detected prior to treatment. There were no mutations detected in newly diagnosed CML-CP \npatients at the end of treatment. \n \nPaediatric patients with ALL \nThe efficacy of SPRYCEL in combination with chemotherapy was evaluated in a pivotal study in \npaediatric patients over one year of age with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. \n\n\n\n 70\n\n \nIn this multicenter, historically-controlled Phase II study of dasatinib added to standard chemotherapy, \n106 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, of whom 104 patients had confirmed \nPh+ ALL, received dasatinib at a daily dose of 60 mg/m2 on a continuous dosing regimen for up to \n24 months, in combination with chemotherapy. Eighty-two patients received dasatinib tablets \nexclusively and 24 patients received dasatinib powder for oral suspension at least once, 8 of whom \nreceived dasatinib powder for oral suspension exclusively. The backbone chemotherapy regimen was \nthe same as used in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 trial (chemotherapeutic standard multi-agent \nchemotherapy protocol). The primary efficacy endpoint was 3-year event-free survival (EFS), which \nwas 65.5% (55.5, 73.7).  \n \nThe minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate assessed by Ig/TCR rearrangement was 71.7% by \nthe end of consolidation in all treated patients. When this rate was based on the 85 patients with \nevaluable Ig/TCR assessments, the estimate was 89.4%. The MRD negativity rates at the end of \ninduction and consolidation as measured by flow cytometry were 66.0% and 84.0%, respectively. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were evaluated in 229 adult healthy subjects and in 84 patients. \n \nAbsorption \nDasatinib is rapidly absorbed in patients following oral administration, with peak concentrations \nbetween 0.5-3 hours. Following oral administration, the increase in the mean exposure (AUCτ) is \napproximately proportional to the dose increment across doses ranging from 25 mg to 120 mg twice \ndaily. The overall mean terminal half-life of dasatinib is approximately 5-6 hours in patients. \n \nData from healthy subjects administered a single 100 mg dose of dasatinib 30 minutes following a \nhigh-fat meal indicated a 14% increase in the mean AUC of dasatinib. A low-fat meal 30 minutes prior \nto dasatinib resulted in a 21% increase in the mean AUC of dasatinib. The observed food effects do \nnot represent clinically relevant changes in exposure. Dasatinib exposure variability is higher under \nfasted conditions (47% CV) compared to light-fat meal (39% CV) and high-fat meal (32% CV) \nconditions. \n \nBased on the patient population PK analysis, variability in dasatinib exposure was estimated to be \nmainly due to inter-occasion variability in bioavailability (44% CV) and, to a lesser extent, due to \ninter-individual variability in bioavailability and inter-individual variability in clearance (30% and \n32% CV, respectively). The random inter-occasion variability in exposure is not expected to affect the \ncumulative exposure and efficacy or safety. \n \nDistribution \nIn patients, dasatinib has a large apparent volume of distribution (2,505 L), coefficient of variation \n(CV% 93%), suggesting that the medicinal product is extensively distributed in the extravascular \nspace. At clinically relevant concentrations of dasatinib, binding to plasma proteins was approximately \n96% on the basis of in vitro experiments. \n \nBiotransformation \nDasatinib is extensively metabolised in humans with multiple enzymes involved in the generation of \nthe metabolites. In healthy subjects administered 100 mg of [14C]-labelled dasatinib, unchanged \ndasatinib represented 29% of circulating radioactivity in plasma. Plasma concentration and measured \nin vitro activity indicate that metabolites of dasatinib are unlikely to play a major role in the observed \npharmacology of the product. CYP3A4 is a major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dasatinib. \n \nElimination \nThe mean terminal half-life of dasatinib is 3 hours to 5 hours. The mean apparent oral clearance is \n363.8 L/hr (CV% 81.3%). \n \n\n\n\n 71\n\nElimination is predominantly in the faeces, mostly as metabolites. Following a single oral dose of \n[14C]-labelled dasatinib, approximately 89% of the dose was eliminated within 10 days, with 4% and \n85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine and faeces, respectively. Unchanged dasatinib \naccounted for 0.1% and 19% of the dose in urine and faeces, respectively, with the remainder of the \ndose as metabolites. \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of dasatinib was assessed in 8 \nmoderately hepatic-impaired subjects who received a 50 mg dose and 5 severely hepatic-impaired \nsubjects who received a 20 mg dose compared to matched healthy subjects who received a 70 mg dose \nof dasatinib. The mean Cmax and AUC of dasatinib adjusted for the 70 mg dose were decreased by 47% \nand 8%, respectively, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal \nhepatic function. In severely hepatic-impaired subjects, the mean Cmax and AUC adjusted for the \n70 mg dose were decreased by 43% and 28%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nDasatinib and its metabolites are minimally excreted via the kidney. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe pharmacokinetics of dasatinib have been evaluated in 104 paediatric patients with leukaemia or \nsolid tumours (72 who received the tablet formulation and 32 who received the powder for oral \nsuspension). \n \nIn a paediatric pharmacokinetics study, dose-normalized dasatinib exposure (Cavg, Cmin and Cmax) \nappears similar between 21 patients with CP-CML and 16 patients with Ph+ ALL. \n \nA bioequivalence study evaluating the powder for oral suspension to the reference tablet formulation \nin 77 adult patients showed that the exposure for the powder for oral suspension was 19% less than \nthat of reference tablets. Concentration data in 32 paediatric patients treated with the powder for oral \nsuspension dose of 72 mg/m2 was pooled with data from the tablet for a population pharmacokinetic \n(PPK) analysis, which showed that the exposure of the powder for oral suspension (as measured by \ntime-averaged concentration at steady state [Cavgss]) at 72 mg/m2 was approximately 30% lower than \nthat of the tablet at 60 mg/m2. A PPK model-based simulation predicted that the body weight tiered \ndosing recommendation described for the powder for oral suspension, in section 4.2 of the Summary \nof Product Characteristics for the powder for oral suspension, is expected to provide similar exposure \nto a tablet dose of 60 mg/m2. These data should be considered if patients are to switch from powder for \noral suspension to tablets or vice versa. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe non-clinical safety profile of dasatinib was assessed in a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies in \nmice, rats, monkeys, and rabbits. \n \nThe primary toxicities occurred in the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic, and lymphoid systems. \nGastrointestinal toxicity was dose-limiting in rats and monkeys, as the intestine was a consistent target \norgan. In rats, minimal to mild decreases in erythrocyte parameters were accompanied by bone \nmarrow changes; similar changes occurred in monkeys at a lower incidence. Lymphoid toxicity in rats \nconsisted of lymphoid depletion of the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, and decreased lymphoid \norgan weights. Changes in the gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were reversible \nfollowing cessation of treatment. \n \nRenal changes in monkeys treated for up to 9 months were limited to an increase in background \nkidney mineralisation. Cutaneous haemorrhage was observed in an acute, single-dose oral study in \nmonkeys but was not observed in repeat-dose studies in either monkeys or rats. In rats, dasatinib \ninhibited platelet aggregation in vitro and prolonged cuticle bleeding time in vivo, but did not invoke \nspontaneous haemorrhage. \n \n\n\n\n 72\n\nDasatinib activity in vitro in hERG and Purkinje fiber assays suggested a potential for prolongation of \ncardiac ventricular repolarisation (QT interval). However, in an in vivo single-dose study in conscious \ntelemetered monkeys, there were no changes in QT interval or ECG wave form. \n \nDasatinib was not mutagenic in in vitro bacterial cell assays (Ames test) and was not genotoxic in an \nin vivo rat micronucleus study. Dasatinib was clastogenic in vitro to dividing Chinese Hamster Ovary \n(CHO) cells. \n \nDasatinib did not affect male or female fertility in a conventional rat fertility and early embryonic \ndevelopment study, but induced embryolethality at dose levels approximating human clinical \nexposures. In embryofoetal development studies, dasatinib likewise induced embryolethality with \nassociated decreases in litter size in rats, as well as foetal skeletal alterations in both rats and rabbits. \nThese effects occurred at doses that did not produce maternal toxicity, indicating that dasatinib is a \nselective reproductive toxicant from implantation through the completion of organogenesis. \n \nIn mice, dasatinib induced immunosuppression, which was dose-related and effectively managed by \ndose reduction and/or changes in dosing schedule. Dasatinib had phototoxic potential in an in vitro \nneutral red uptake phototoxicity assay in mouse fibroblasts. Dasatinib was considered to be \nnon-phototoxic in vivo after a single oral administration to female hairless mice at exposures up to \n3-fold the human exposure following administration of the recommended therapeutic dose (based on \nAUC). \n \nIn a two-year carcinogenicity study, rats were administered oral doses of dasatinib at 0.3, 1, and \n3 mg/kg/day. The highest dose resulted in a plasma exposure (AUC) level generally equivalent to the \nhuman exposure at the recommended range of starting doses from 100 mg to 140 mg daily. A \nstatistically significant increase in the combined incidence of squamous cell carcinomas and \npapillomas in the uterus and cervix of high-dose females and of prostate adenoma in low-dose males \nwas noted. The relevance of the findings from the rat carcinogenicity study for humans is not known. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients  \n \nSucrose \nCarmellose sodium \nSimethicone emulsion  \nconsisting of:  \n\nsimeticone,  \npolyethylene glycol sorbitan tristearate,  \npolyethoxylate stearate,  \nglycerides,  \nmethylcellulose,  \nxanthan gum,  \nbenzoic acid,  \nsorbic acid,  \nsulfuric acid. \n\nTartaric acid \nTrisodium citrate anhydrous \nSodium benzoate (E211) \nSilica hydrophobic colloidal \nMixed berry flavour [containing benzyl alcohol, sulphur dioxide (E220)] \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNot applicable. \n \n\n\n\n 73\n\n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened bottle \n2 years. \n \nAfter constitution \nThe oral suspension is stable for 60 days. Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze.  \n \nConstituted oral suspension mixed with milk, yogurt, apple juice, or applesauce may be stored at or \nbelow 25°C for up to 1 hour. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore below 25°C. \n \nFor storage conditions after constitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n120-mL high-density polyethylene bottle with polypropylene child-resistant closure containing 33 g of \npowder for oral suspension. \n \nPack size: 1 bottle \n \nEach pack also contains a low-density polyethylene press-in-bottle adapter (PIBA) and a 12-mL oral \ndosing syringe (polypropylene syringe barrel with high-density polyethylene syringe plunger rod) in a \nsealed plastic bag. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nSPRYCEL powder for oral suspension must be constituted by a pharmacist or qualified healthcare \nprofessional prior to being dispensed to the patient. The powder for oral suspension consists of powder \nblend with the active substance plus excipients, contained within a bottle for constitution. Once \nconstituted, the bottle contains 99 mL of oral suspension, of which 90 mL is intended for dosing and \nadministration.  \n \nThe use of latex or nitrile gloves is recommended when handling any powder that is inadvertently \nspilled from the bottle, for appropriate disposal in order to minimise the risk of dermal exposure. \n \nInstructions for constitution of powder for oral suspension  \n \nSPRYCEL powder for oral suspension is to be constituted as follows: \nNote: If you have to constitute more than one bottle, complete one bottle at a time.  \nWash your hands before initiating the constitution. This procedure should be performed on a clean \nsurface. \n \nStep 1: Tap bottom of each bottle (containing 33 g SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension) gently to \nloosen the powder. Remove child-resistant closure and foil seal. Add 77.0 mL of purified water all at \nonce to the bottle and close tightly with closure. \nStep 2: Immediately invert the bottle and shake vigorously for no less than 60 seconds to obtain a \nuniform suspension. If there are still visible clumps, continue shaking until no clumps are visible. \n\n\n\n 74\n\nConstitution in this way produces 90 mL (deliverable volume) of 10 mg/mL SPRYCEL oral \nsuspension. \nStep 3: Remove the closure, insert the press-in bottle adapter (PIBA) into the bottle neck, and close the \nbottle tightly with the child-resistant closure. \nStep 4: Write the date of expiry of the constituted oral suspension on the bottle label (the date of \nexpiry of the constituted oral suspension is 60 days from the date of constitution).  \nStep 5: Dispense the bottle with inserted PIBA, package leaflet, and oral dosing syringe in the original \ncarton to the patient or caregiver. Remind the patient or caregiver to shake the bottle vigorously prior \nto each use. \n \nInstructions for administration to the patient \n Take SPRYCEL oral suspension on an empty or full stomach.  \n Wash your hands before and after each use. \n Store the constituted oral suspension in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. \n Review total prescribed dose and determine number of milliliters (mL) you will need.  \n If the amount needed is greater than 11 mL, it must be split into 2 doses as indicated in Table 16. \n \nTable 16:  How to split a dose of oral suspension that is greater than 11 mL \n \n\nTotal prescribed dose (mL) First dose (mL) Second dose (mL) \n12 6 6 \n13 7 6 \n14 7 7 \n15 8 7 \n16 8 8 \n\n \nBefore you prepare a dose of SPRYCEL oral suspension for administration to the patient, get the \nfollowing supplies ready: \n \n\n Paper towel \n 1 SPRYCEL oral \n\nsuspension bottle \ncontaining a white \nto yellow opaque \nsuspension. \n\n 12-mL oral syringe \nprovided with the \nbottle. \n\n A small container \nfilled with water to \nuse to rinse the \nsyringe. \n\n \n\n \n \n\noral syringe bottle \n\n\n\n 75\n\nCarefully prepare the SPRYCEL oral suspension for administration, measure the dose, and fill the \nsyringe, like this: \n \n\n1. Mix the SPRYCEL oral \nsuspension in the closed bottle \nby shaking for 30 seconds. \n\n \n Shake well before each \n\nuse. \n\n \n \n\n2. Remove the closure from \nthe bottle. Make sure the \nadapter provided on the bottle \nfor syringe placement is firmly \npressed into the bottle. \n\n \n \n\n3. Look at the measurements \non the side of the syringe so \nyou can see how much to fill it \nbefore you begin. Note that the \nmarkings on the syringe are in \nmL. Find the marking that \nmatches the dose that was \nprescribed by your doctor. \nBefore each use, make sure the \nsyringe plunger is pushed to \nthe bottom of the syringe \nbarrel. \n\n \n \n\nShake  \nbottle \nrepeatedly \nfor 30 \nseconds. \n\nMake \nsure \nbottle \nadapter \nis firmly \npressed. \n\n\n\n 76\n\n4. With the bottle in an upright \nposition, insert the tip of the \nsyringe firmly into the bottle \nadapter. \n\n \n \n\n5. Holding the syringe tip \nfirmly into the bottle, turn the \nbottle with the syringe upside \ndown. \n\n \n \n\n6. Slowly withdraw the \namount of SPRYCEL oral \nsuspension prescribed by \npulling the syringe plunger \nuntil it reaches the marking of \nthe dose prescribed. \n Hold plunger to prevent it \n\nfrom moving. There may \nbe a vacuum pulling the \nplunger back into barrel. \n\n If unable to fill with one \nbottle, use the second \nbottle to complete the full \nprescribed dose. Make \nsure the second bottle is \nshaken before use. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n 77\n\n7. Holding the syringe tip \nfirmly in the bottle, turn the \nbottle with the syringe upright \nagain. \n\n \n \n\n8. Remove the syringe from \nthe bottle being careful not to \ndepress the plunger. \n\n \n \n\n9. With the patient in an \nupright position, place the tip \nof the syringe into the mouth \nbetween the side of the mouth \nand the tongue. Slowly push \nthe plunger down until all of \nthe dose has been given. \n Check to make sure the \n\npatient has swallowed all \nof the dose. \n\n If a second dose is needed \nto complete the total \nprescribed dose, repeat \nsteps 3 through 10.  \n\n Put closure back on the \nbottle and close tightly. \nStore upright. \n\n \n\n\n\n 78\n\n10. Wash the outside \nand the inside of the \nsyringe with water \nand allow to air dry \nafter each use to re-\nuse for the next day.  \n\n \n\n Do not wash in a \ndishwasher. \n \n\n Do not take the \nsyringe apart in \norder to avoid \ndamaging it. \n\n \n \n11. Refer to the \npackage leaflet (see \nsection 5 ‘How to \nstore SPRYCEL’) for \ninstructions on \ndiscarding any \nunused medicine, \nsyringe and bottle. \n\n \n \n\nOnce constituted, the oral suspension should only be administered using the oral dosing syringe \nsupplied with each pack. Refer to the package leaflet for more detailed instructions for use. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects , talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take SPRYCEL \n3. How to take SPRYCEL \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store SPRYCEL \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What SPRYCEL is and what it is used for \n \nSPRYCEL contains the active substance dasatinib. This medicine is used to treat chronic myeloid \nleukaemia (CML) in adults, adolescents and children at least 1 year of age. Leukaemia is a cancer of \nwhite blood cells. These white cells usually help the body to fight infection. In people with CML, \nwhite cells called granulocytes start growing out of control. SPRYCEL inhibits the growth of these \nleukaemic cells. \n \nSPRYCEL is also used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic \nleukaemia (ALL) in adults, adolescents and children at least 1 year of age, and lymphoid blast CML in \nadults who are not benefiting from prior therapies. In people with ALL, white cells called lymphocytes \nmultiply too quickly and live too long. SPRYCEL inhibits the growth of these leukaemic cells. \n \nIf you have any questions about how SPRYCEL works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \nyou, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take SPRYCEL \n \nDo not take SPRYCEL \n if you are allergic to dasatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nIf you could be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using SPRYCEL  \n if you are taking medicines to thin the blood or prevent clots (see \"Other medicines and \n\nSPRYCEL\") \n\n\n\n 107\n\n if you have a liver or heart problem, or used to have one \n if you start having difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a cough when taking SPRYCEL: this \n\nmay be a sign of fluid retention in the lungs or chest (which can be more common in patients \naged 65 years and older), or due to changes in the blood vessels supplying the lungs \n\n if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because SPRYCEL \ncould cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will \nbe carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking SPRYCEL, \ncontact your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy (TMA). \n\n \nYour doctor will regularly monitor your condition to check whether SPRYCEL is having the desired \neffect. You will also have blood tests regularly while you are taking SPRYCEL. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children younger than one year of age. There is limited experience with \nthe use of SPRYCEL in this age group. Bone growth and development will be closely monitored in \nchildren taking SPRYCEL. \n \nOther medicines and SPRYCEL \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nSPRYCEL is mainly handled by the liver. Certain medicines may interfere with the effect of \nSPRYCEL when taken together. \n \nThese medicines are not to be used with SPRYCEL: \n ketoconazole, itraconazole - these are antifungal medicines \n erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin - these are antibiotics \n ritonavir - this is an antiviral medicine \n phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital - these are treaments for epilepsy \n rifampicin - this is a treatment for tuberculosis \n famotidine, omeprazole - these are medicines that block stomach acids \n St. John’s wort - a herbal preparation obtained without a prescription, used to treat depression \n\nand other conditions (also known as Hypericum perforatum) \n \nDo not take medicines that neutralise stomach acids (antacids such as aluminium hydroxide or \nmagnesium hydroxide) in the 2 hours before or 2 hours after taking SPRYCEL. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines to thin the blood or prevent clots. \n \nSPRYCEL with food and drink \nDo not take SPRYCEL with grapefruit or grapefruit juice. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor immediately. SPRYCEL is not \nto be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Your doctor will discuss with you the \npotential risk of taking SPRYCEL during pregnancy. \nBoth men and women taking SPRYCEL will be advised to use effective contraception during \ntreatment. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. You should stop breast-feeding while you are taking \nSPRYCEL. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTake special care when driving or using machines in case you experience side effects such as dizziness \nand blurred vision. \n \n\n\n\n 108\n\nSPRYCEL contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take SPRYCEL \n \nSPRYCEL will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in treating leukaemia. Always \ntake this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. SPRYCEL is prescribed for adults and children at least 1 year of age. \n \nThe starting dose recommended for adult patients with chronic phase CML is 100 mg once a \nday. \n \nThe starting dose recommended for adult patients with accelerated or blast crisis CML or Ph+ \nALL is 140 mg once a day. \n \nDosing for children with chronic phase CML or Ph+ ALL is on the basis of body weight. \nSPRYCEL is administered orally once daily in the form of either SPRYCEL tablets or SPRYCEL \npowder for oral suspension. SPRYCEL tablets are not recommended for patients weighing less than \n10 kg. The powder for oral suspension should be used for patients weighing less than 10 kg and \npatients who cannot swallow tablets. A change in dose may occur when switching between \nformulations (i.e., tablets and powder for oral suspension), so you should not switch from one to the \nother. \n \nYour doctor will decide the right formulation and dose based on your weight, any side effects and \nresponse to treatment. The starting dose of SPRYCEL for children is calculated by body weight as \nshown below: \n \nBody Weight (kg)a Daily Dose (mg)\n10 to less than 20 kg 40 mg \n20 to less than 30 kg 60 mg \n30 to less than 45 kg 70 mg \nat least 45 kg 100 mg \n\na The tablet is not recommended for patients weighing less than 10 kg; the powder for oral suspension should be used for these \npatients. \n\n \nThere is no dose recommendation for SPRYCEL with children under 1 year of age.  \n \nDepending on how you respond to the treatment, your doctor may suggest a higher or lower dose, or \neven stopping treatment briefly. For higher or lower doses, you may need to take combinations of the \ndifferent tablet strengths. \n \nThe tablets may come in packs with calendar blisters. These are blisters showing the days of the \nweek. There are arrows to show the next tablet to be taken according to your treatment schedule. \n \nHow to take SPRYCEL \nTake your tablets at the same time every day. Swallow the tablets whole. Do not crush, cut or \nchew them. Do not take dispersed tablets. You cannot be sure you will receive the correct dose if you \ncrush, cut, chew or disperse the tablets. SPRYCEL tablets can be taken with or without a meal. \n \nSpecial handling instructions for SPRYCEL \nIt is unlikely that the SPRYCEL tablets will get broken. But if they do, persons other than the patient \nshould use gloves when handling SPRYCEL. \n \nHow long to take SPRYCEL \nTake SPRYCEL daily until your doctor tells you to stop. Make sure you take SPRYCEL for as long as \nit is prescribed. \n\n\n\n 109\n\n \nIf you take more SPRYCEL than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets, talk to your doctor immediately. You may require \nmedical attention. \n \nIf you forget to take SPRYCEL \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. Take the next scheduled dose at the \nregular time. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take SPRYCEL \n3. How to take SPRYCEL \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store SPRYCEL \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What SPRYCEL is and what it is used for \n \nSPRYCEL contains the active substance dasatinib. This medicine is used to treat chronic myeloid \nleukaemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) \nin adolescents and children from at least one year of age. Leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells. \nThese white cells usually help the body to fight infection. In people with CML, white cells called \ngranulocytes start growing out of control. SPRYCEL inhibits the growth of these leukaemic cells. \n \nIf you have any questions about how SPRYCEL works or why this medicine has been prescribed for \nyou or your child, ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take SPRYCEL \n \nDo not take SPRYCEL \n if you are allergic to dasatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nIf you or your child could be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using SPRYCEL   \n if you are taking medicines to thin the blood or prevent clots (see \"Other medicines and \n\nSPRYCEL\") \n if you have a liver or heart problem, or used to have one \n if you start having difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a cough when taking SPRYCEL: this \n\nmay be a sign of fluid retention in the lungs or chest (which can be more common in patients \naged 65 years and older), or due to changes in the blood vessels supplying the lungs \n\n if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because SPRYCEL could \ncause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be \ncarefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n if you experience bruising, bleeding, fever, fatigue and confusion when taking SPRYCEL, \ncontact your doctor. This may be a sign of damage to blood vessels known as thrombotic \nmicroangiopathy (TMA). \n\n\n\n 115\n\n \nYour doctor will regularly monitor your condition to check whether SPRYCEL is having the desired \neffect. You or your child will also have blood tests regularly while taking SPRYCEL. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children younger than one year of age. \nBone growth and development will be closely monitored in children taking SPRYCEL. \n \nOther medicines and SPRYCEL \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nSPRYCEL is mainly handled by the liver. Certain medicines may interfere with the effect of \nSPRYCEL when taken together. \n \nThese medicines are not to be used with SPRYCEL: \n ketoconazole, itraconazole - these are antifungal medicines \n erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin - these are antibiotics \n ritonavir - this is an antiviral medicine \n phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital - these are treaments for epilepsy \n rifampicin - this is a treatment for tuberculosis \n famotidine, omeprazole - these are medicines that block stomach acids \n St. John’s wort - a herbal preparation obtained without a prescription, used to treat depression \n\nand other conditions (also known as Hypericum perforatum) \n \nDo not take medicines that neutralise stomach acids (antacids such as aluminium hydroxide or \nmagnesium hydroxide) in the 2 hours before or 2 hours after taking SPRYCEL. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines to thin the blood or prevent clots. \n \nSPRYCEL with food and drink \nDo not take SPRYCEL with grapefruit or grapefruit juice. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or may be pregnant, tell your doctor immediately. SPRYCEL is not to be used \nduring pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risk of \ntaking SPRYCEL during pregnancy. \nBoth men and women taking SPRYCEL will be advised to use effective contraception during \ntreatment. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. You should stop breast-feeding while you are taking \nSPRYCEL. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTake special care when driving or using machines in case you experience side effects such as dizziness \nand blurred vision. \n \nSPRYCEL contains sucrose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine.  \nContains 0.29 g of sucrose per mL of oral suspension. This should be taken into account in patients \nwith diabetes mellitus. May be harmful to the teeth. \n \nSPRYCEL contains sodium \nThis medicinal product contains 2.1 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per mL of \nSPRYCEL oral suspension. At the maximum daily dose of 16 mL oral suspension, this is equivalent to \n1.7% of the WHO recommended maximum daily dietary intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n\n\n\n 116\n\nSPRYCEL contains benzoic acid and sodium benzoate \nSPRYCEL contains 0.25 mg benzoic acid in each mL of oral suspension and 0.25 mg sodium \nbenzoate in each mL of oral suspension. \nBenzoic acid/Benzoate salt may increase jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies \n(up to 4 weeks old). \n \nSPRYCEL contains benzyl alcohol \nSPRYCEL contains 0.017 mg benzyl alcohol in each mL of oral suspension. \nBenzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nUse of SPRYCEL is not recommended during pregnancy. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if \nyou are pregnant or breast feeding. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in \nyour body and may cause side effects (called “metabolic acidosis”). \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large \namounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called “metabolic \nacidosis”). \n \nSPRYCEL contains sulphur dioxide (E220) \nMay rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. \n \n \n3. How to take SPRYCEL \n \nSPRYCEL will only be prescribed by a doctor with experience in treating leukaemia. Always take this \nmedicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not \nsure. \n \nSPRYCEL oral suspension is taken once daily. Your doctor will decide the right dose based on your \nweight. The starting dose of SPRYCEL is calculated by body weight as shown below: \n \nBody Weight (kg)  Daily Dose, mL (mg) \n5 to less than 10 kg 4 mL (40 mg) \n10 to less than 20 kg 6 mL (60 mg) \n20 to less than 30 kg 9 mL (90 mg) \n30 to less than 45 kg 10.5 mL (105 mg) \nat least 45 kg 12 mL (120 mg) \n\n \nSPRYCEL is also available as tablets for use in adults and children from one year of age and weighing \nmore than 10 kg. The powder for oral suspension should be used for patients weighing less than 10 kg \nand patients who cannot swallow tablets. A change in dose may occur when switching between \nformulations (i.e., tablets and powder for oral suspension), so you should not switch from one to the \nother. Your doctor will decide the right formulation and dose based on your weight, any side effects \nand response to treatment.  \n \nThere is no dose recommendation for SPRYCEL with children under 1 year of age.  \n \nDepending on how you respond to the treatment, your doctor may suggest a higher or lower dose, or \neven stopping treatment briefly. \n  \nHow to take SPRYCEL \nYour pharmacist or qualified healthcare professional will constitute (mix to form a liquid) \nSPRYCEL powder for oral suspension to form SPRYCEL oral suspension before dispensing to \nyou. \n \nSPRYCEL should be taken at the same time every day. SPRYCEL can be taken with or without a \nmeal. SPRYCEL oral suspension may be mixed with milk, yogurt, apple juice, or applesauce. \n\n\n\n 117\n\n \nSee the \"Instructions for administration to the patient\" at the end of the package leaflet for how to give \na dose of SPRYCEL oral suspension. \n \nSpecial handling instructions for SPRYCEL \nPersons other than the patient should use gloves when handling SPRYCEL. \nPregnant or breast-feeding women should avoid exposure to SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension. \n \nHow long to take SPRYCEL \nTake SPRYCEL daily until your doctor tells you to stop.

This procedure should be performed on a clean \nsurface. \n \nStep 1: Tap bottom of each bottle (containing 33 g SPRYCEL powder for oral suspension) gently to \nloosen the powder. Remove child-resistant closure and foil seal. Add 77.0 mL of purified water all at \nonce to the bottle and close tightly with closure. \nStep 2: Immediately invert the bottle and shake vigorously for no less than 60 seconds to obtain a \nuniform suspension. If there are still visible clumps, continue shaking until no clumps are visible. \n\nDO NOT USE A \nDISHWASHER \n\nALLOW TO AIR \nDRY AFTER EACH \n\nUSE \n\nDO NOT TAKE \nAPART THE \n\nSYRINGE \n\n\n\n 127\n\nConstitution in this way produces 90 mL (deliverable volume) of 10 mg/mL SPRYCEL oral \nsuspension. \nStep 3: Remove the closure, insert the press-in bottle adapter (PIBA) into the bottle neck, and close the \nbottle tightly with the child-resistant closure. \nStep 4: Write the date of expiry of the constituted oral suspension on the bottle label (the date of \nexpiry of the constituted oral suspension is 60 days from the date of constitution). \nStep 5: Dispense the bottle with inserted PIBA, package leaflet, and oral dosing syringe in the original \ncarton to the patient or caregiver.
