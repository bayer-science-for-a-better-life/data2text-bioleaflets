NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nNeoclarityn 5 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 5 mg desloratadine.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\nThis medicine contains lactose. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablets\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nNeoclarityn is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older for the relief of symptoms \nassociated with:\n- allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1)\n- urticaria (see section 5.1)\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and over)\nThe recommended dose of Neoclarityn is one tablet once a day.\n\nIntermittent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than \n4 weeks) should be managed in accordance with the evaluation of patient\u2019s disease history and the \ntreatment could be discontinued after symptoms are resolved and reinitiated upon their reappearance. \nIn persistent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than \n4 weeks), continued treatment may be proposed to the patients during the allergen exposure periods.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in adolescents \n12 through 17 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Neoclarityn 5 mg film-coated tablets in children below the age of 12 years \nhave not been established.\n\nMethod of administration\nOral use.\nThe dose can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to loratadine.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nIn the case of severe renal insufficiency, Neoclarityn should be used with caution (see section 5.2).\n\nDesloratadine should be administered with caution in patients with medical or familial history of \nseizures, and mainly young children (see section 4.8), being more susceptible to develop new seizures \nunder desloratadine treatment. Healthcare providers may consider discontinuing desloratadine in \npatients who experience a seizure while on treatment.\n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which \nerythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1).\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nIn a clinical pharmacology trial, Neoclarityn tablets taken concomitantly with alcohol did not \npotentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1). However, cases of alcohol \nintolerance and intoxication have been reported during post-marketing use. Therefore, caution is \nrecommended if alcohol is taken concomitantly.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no \nmalformative nor foeto/ neonatal toxicity of desloratadine. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Neoclarityn during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nDesloratadine has been identified in breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. The effect of \ndesloratadine on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Neoclarityn therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data available on male and female fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNeoclarityn has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines based on clinical \ntrials. Patients should be informed that most people do not experience drowsiness. Nevertheless, as \nthere is individual variation in response to all medicinal products, it is recommended that patients are \nadvised not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or using machines, \nuntil they have established their own response to the medicinal product.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn clinical trials in a range of indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at \nthe recommended dose of 5 mg daily, undesirable effects with Neoclarityn were reported in 3 % of \n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\npatients in excess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent of adverse reactions reported in \nexcess of placebo were fatigue (1.2 %), dry mouth (0.8 %) and headache (0.6 %). \n\nPaediatric population\nIn a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 17 years of age, the most common adverse \nevent was headache; this occurred in 5.9 % of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9 % of \npatients receiving placebo.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe frequency of the clinical trial adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo and other \nundesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period are listed in the following table. \nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data).\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions seen with \nNeoclarityn\n\nMetabolism and nutrition\ndisorders\n\nNot known Increased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders Very rare\nNot known\n\nHallucinations\nAbnormal behaviour, aggression\n\nNervous system disorders Common\nVery rare\n\nHeadache\nDizziness, somnolence, insomnia, \npsychomotor hyperactivity, seizures\n\nCardiac disorders Very rare\nNot known\n\nTachycardia, palpitations\nQT prolongation\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common\nVery rare\n\nDry mouth\nAbdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, \ndyspepsia, diarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Very rare\n\nNot known\n\nElevations of liver enzymes, \nincreased bilirubin, hepatitis\nJaundice\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nNot known Photosensitivity\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\n\nVery rare Myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nCommon\nVery rare\n\nNot known\n\nFatigue\nHypersensitivity reactions (such as \nanaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnoea, \npruritus, rash, and urticaria)\nAsthenia\n\nInvestigations Not known Weight increased\n\nPaediatric population\nOther undesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period in paediatric patients with an \nunknown frequency included QT prolongation, arrhythmia, bradycardia, abnormal behaviour, and \naggression.\n\nA retrospective observational safety study indicated an increased incidence of new-onset seizure in \npatients 0 to 19 years of age when receiving desloratadine compared with periods not receiving \ndesloratadine. Among children 0-4 years old, the adjusted absolute increase was 37.5 (95% \nConfidence Interval (CI) 10.5-64.5) per 100,000 person years (PY) with a background rate of new \nonset seizure of 80.3 per 100,000 PY. Among patients 5-19 years of age, the adjusted absolute \nincrease was 11.3 (95% CI 2.3-20.2) per 100,000 PY with a background rate of 36.4 per 100,000 PY. \n(See section 4.4.)\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to \nthat seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher.\n\nTreatment\nIn the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove unabsorbed active substance. \nSymptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended.\n\nDesloratadine is not eliminated by haemodialysis; it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal \ndialysis.\n\nSymptoms\nBased on a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine was administered \n(nine times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to \nthat seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihistamines \u2013 H1 antagonist, ATC code: R06A X27\n\nMechanism of action\nDesloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-\nreceptor antagonist activity. After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral \nhistamine H1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system.\n\nDesloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting \nthe release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast \ncells/basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on \nendothelial cells. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be confirmed.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nIn a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for \n14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed. In a clinical \npharmacology trial, in which desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the \nclinical dose) for ten days, no prolongation of QTc interval was seen.\n\nNo clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose \nketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials.\n\nDesloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In controlled clinical trials, at the \nrecommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to \nplacebo. Neoclarityn given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg did not affect psychomotor performance in \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6\n\nclinical trials. In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard \nmeasures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to \nflying.\n\nIn clinical pharmacology trials, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol-induced\nimpairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were found in the \npsychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or \nwith alcohol. \n\nIn patients with allergic rhinitis, Neoclarityn was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, \nnasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, and itching of palate. \nNeoclarityn effectively controlled symptoms for 24 hours.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe efficacy of Neoclarityn tablets has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent patients \n12 through 17 years of age.\n\nIn addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can \nalternatively be classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to \nthe duration of symptoms. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less \nthan 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of \nsymptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks.\n\nNeoclarityn was effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total \nscore of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was seen in \nthe domains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms. \n\nChronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the \nunderlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be \nmore easily recruited prospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, \ndesloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial \nconditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines.\n\nIn two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Neoclarityn was \neffective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first \ndosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval. As with \nother antihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified \nas non-responsive to antihistamines was excluded. An improvement in pruritus of more than 50 % \nwas observed in 55 % of patients treated with desloratadine compared with 19 % of patients treated \nwith placebo. Treatment with Neoclarityn also significantly reduced interference with sleep and \ndaytime function, as measured by a four-point scale used to assess these variables.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nDesloratadine plasma concentrations can be detected within 30 minutes of administration. \nDesloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration achieved after approximately 3 hours; \nthe terminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours. The degree of accumulation of desloratadine \nwas consistent with its half-life (approximately 27 hours) and a once daily dosing frequency. The \nbioavailability of desloratadine was dose proportional over the range of 5 mg to 20 mg. \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic trial in which patient demographics were comparable to those of the general \nseasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4 % of the subjects achieved a higher concentration of \ndesloratadine. This percentage may vary according to ethnic background. Maximum desloratadine \nconcentration was about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of \n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\napproximately 89 hours. The safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general \npopulation.\n\nDistribution\nDesloratadine is moderately bound (83 % - 87 %) to plasma proteins. There is no evidence of \nclinically relevant medicine accumulation following once daily dosing of desloratadine (5 mg to \n20 mg) for 14 days. \n\nBiotransformation\nThe enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and \ntherefore, some interactions with other medicinal products cannot be fully excluded. Desloratadine \ndoes not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not \ninhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.\n\nElimination\nIn a single dose trial using a 7.5 mg dose of desloratadine, there was no effect of food (high-fat, high \ncaloric breakfast) on the disposition of desloratadine. In another study, grapefruit juice had no effect \non the disposition of desloratadine.\n\nRenally impaired patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of desloratadine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was \ncompared with that of healthy subjects in one single-dose study and one multiple dose study. In the \nsingle-dose study, the exposure to desloratadine was approximately 2 and 2.5-fold greater in subjects \nwith mild to moderate and severe CRI, respectively, than in healthy subjects. In the multiple-dose \nstudy, steady state was reached after Day 11, and compared to healthy subjects the exposure to \ndesloratadine was ~1.5-fold greater in subjects with mild to moderate CRI and ~2.5-fold greater in \nsubjects with severe CRI. In both studies, changes in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine and \n3-hydroxydesloratadine were not clinically relevant.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nDesloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Non-clinical studies conducted with \ndesloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in \nthe toxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine.\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction\nand development. The lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with \ndesloratadine and loratadine.\n\n6.

Therefore, the efficacy of \nNeoclarityn orodispersible tablet is expected to be the same as with the Neoclarityn tablet \nformulation.\n\nIn a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for \n14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed. In a clinical \npharmacology trial, in which desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the \nclinical dose) for ten days, no prolongation of QTc interval was seen.\n\nNo clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose, \nketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials.\n\nDesloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In clinical trials, at the \nrecommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to \nplacebo. Neoclarityn tablets given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg did not affect psychomotor \nperformance in clinical trials. In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not \naffect standard measures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or \ntasks related to flying.\n\nIn clinical pharmacology trials, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol-induced \nimpairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were found in the \npsychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or \nwith alcohol. \n\nIn patients with allergic rhinitis, Neoclarityn tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as \nsneezing, nasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, and itching of\npalate. Neoclarityn tablets effectively controlled symptoms for 24 hours.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe efficacy of Neoclarityn tablets has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent patients \n12 through 17 years of age.\n\nIn addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can \nalternatively be classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to \nthe duration of symptoms. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less \nthan 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of \nsymptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks.\n\nNeoclarityn was effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total \nscore of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was seen in \nthe domains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms. \n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nChronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the \nunderlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be \nmore easily recruited prospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, \ndesloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial \nconditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines.\n\nIn two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Neoclarityn was \neffective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first \ndosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval. As with \nother antihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified \nas non-responsive to antihistamines was excluded. An improvement in pruritus of more than 50 % \nwas observed in 55 % of patients treated with desloratadine compared with 19 % of patients treated \nwith placebo. Treatment with Neoclarityn also significantly reduced interference with sleep and \ndaytime function, as measured by a four-point scale used to assess these variables.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption\nDesloratadine plasma concentrations can be detected within 30 minutes of administration. \nDesloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration achieved after approximately 3 hours; \nthe terminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours. The degree of accumulation of desloratadine \nwas consistent with its half-life (approximately 27 hours) and a once daily dosing frequency. The \nbioavailability of desloratadine was dose proportional over the range of 5 mg to 20 mg. \n\nIn a series of pharmacokinetic and clinical trials, 6 % of the subjects reached a higher concentration of \ndesloratadine. The prevalence of this poor metaboliser phenotype was comparable for adult (6 %) and \npaediatric subjects 2- to 11-year old (6 %), and greater among Blacks (18 % adult, 16 % paediatric) \nthan Caucasians (2 % adult, 3 % paediatric) in both populations however the safety profile of these \nsubjects was not different from that of the general population.\n\nIn a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study conducted with the tablet formulation in healthy adult \nsubjects, four subjects were found to be poor metabolisers of desloratadine. These subjects had a Cmax\nconcentration about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of \napproximately 89 hours.\n\nDistribution\nDesloratadine is moderately bound (83 % - 87 %) to plasma proteins. There is no evidence of \nclinically relevant medicine accumulation following once daily dosing of desloratadine (5 mg to \n20 mg) for 14 days. \n\nBiotransformation\nThe enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and \ntherefore, some interactions with other medicinal products cannot be fully excluded. Desloratadine \ndoes not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not \ninhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.\n\nIn single-dose crossover studies of Neoclarityn 5 mg orodispersible tablets with Neoclarityn 5 mg \nconventional tablets, the formulations were bioequivalent. Neoclarityn 2.5 mg tablets has not been \nevaluated in paediatric patients however in conjunction with the dose finding studies in paediatrics, \nthe pharmacokinetics data for Neoclarityn orodispersible tablets supports the use of the 2.5 mg dose in\npaediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age.\n\nElimination\nThe presence of food prolongs Tmax for desloratadine from 2.5 to 4 hours and Tmax for 3-OH-\ndesloratadine from 4 to 6 hours. In a separate study, grapefruit juice had no effect on the disposition \nof desloratadine. Water had no effect on the bioavailability of Neoclarityn orodispersible tablets.\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nRenally impaired patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of desloratadine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was \ncompared with that of healthy subjects in one single-dose study and one multiple dose study. In the \nsingle-dose study, the exposure to desloratadine was approximately 2 and 2.5-fold greater in subjects \nwith mild to moderate and severe CRI, respectively, than in healthy subjects. In the multiple-dose \nstudy, steady state was reached after Day 11, and compared to healthy subjects the exposure to \ndesloratadine was ~1.5-fold greater in subjects with mild to moderate CRI and ~2.5-fold greater in \nsubjects with severe CRI. In both studies, changes in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine and \n3-hydroxydesloratadine were not clinically relevant.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nDesloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Non-clinical studies conducted with \ndesloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in \nthe toxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine.\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction\nand development. The collective analysis of preclinical and clinical irritation studies for the \norodispersible tablet indicate that this formulation in unlikely to pose risk for local irritation with \nclinical use. The lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with \ndesloratadine and loratadine.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nNeoclarityn 5 mg orodispersible tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach orodispersible tablet contains 5 mg desloratadine.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\nThis medicine contains mannitol and aspartame (E951). \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOrodispersible tablet\n\nLight-red, flat-faced, round, speckled tablets, one side branded with \u201cA\u201d \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nNeoclarityn is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older for the relief of symptoms \nassociated with:\n- allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1)\n- urticaria (see section 5.1)\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and over)\nThe recommended dose of Neoclarityn is one 5 mg orodispersible tablet placed in the mouth once a \nday.\n\nIntermittent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than \n4 weeks) should be managed in accordance with the evaluation of patient\u2019s disease history and the \ntreatment could be discontinued after symptoms are resolved and reinitiated upon their reappearance. \nIn persistent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than \n4 weeks), continued treatment may be proposed to the patients during the allergen exposure periods.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in adolescents \n12 through 17 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Neoclarityn 5 mg orodispersible tablets in children below the age of \n12 years have not been established.\n\nMethod of administration\nOral use.\nThe dose can be taken with or without food.\nImmediately before use, the blister must be carefully peeled open and the dose of orodispersible tablet\nremoved without crushing it. The dose of orodispersible tablet is placed in the mouth where it will \n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\ndisperse immediately. Water or other liquid is not needed to swallow the dose. The dose must be \ntaken as soon as the blister has been opened.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to loratadine.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nIn the case of severe renal insufficiency, Neoclarityn should be used with caution (see section 5.2). \n\nDesloratadine should be administered with caution in patients with medical or familial history of \nseizures, and mainly young children (see section 4.8), being more susceptible to develop new seizures \nunder desloratadine treatment. Healthcare providers may consider discontinuing desloratadine in \npatients who experience a seizure while on treatment.\n\nThis product contains 2.9 mg of phenylalanine per 5 mg dose of Neoclarityn orodispersible tablet. \nPhenylalanine may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which \nerythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1). \n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nIn a clinical pharmacology trial, Neoclarityn tablets taken concomitantly with alcohol did not \npotentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1). However, cases of alcohol \nintolerance and intoxication have been reported during post-marketing use. Therefore, caution is \nrecommended if alcohol is taken concomitantly.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no \nmalformative nor foeto/ neonatal toxicity of desloratadine. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Neoclarityn during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nDesloratadine has been identified in breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. The effect of \ndesloratadine on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Neoclarityn therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data available on male and female fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNeoclarityn has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines based on clinical \ntrials. Patients should be informed that most people do not experience drowsiness. Nevertheless, as \nthere is individual variation in response to all medicinal products, it is recommended that patients are \nadvised not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or using machines, \nuntil they have established their own response to the medicinal product.\n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn clinical trials in a range of indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at \nthe recommended dose of 5 mg daily, undesirable effects with Neoclarityn tablets were reported in \n3 % of patients in excess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent of adverse reactions\nreported in excess of placebo were fatigue (1.2 %), dry mouth (0.8 %) and headache (0.6 %). \n\nPaediatric population\nIn a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 17 years of age, the most common adverse \nevent was headache; this occurred in 5.9 % of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9 % of \npatients receiving placebo.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe frequency of the clinical trial adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo and other \nundesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period are listed in the following table. \nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data).\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions seen with \nNeoclarityn\n\nMetabolism and nutrition\ndisorders\n\nNot known Increased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders Very rare\nNot known\n\nHallucinations\nAbnormal behaviour, aggression\n\nNervous system disorders Common\nVery rare\n\nHeadache\nDizziness, somnolence, insomnia, \npsychomotor hyperactivity, seizures\n\nCardiac disorders Very rare\nNot known\n\nTachycardia, palpitations\nQT prolongation\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common\nVery rare\n\nDry mouth\nAbdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, \ndyspepsia, diarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Very rare\n\nNot known\n\nElevations of liver enzymes, \nincreased bilirubin, hepatitis\nJaundice\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nNot known Photosensitivity\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\n\nVery rare Myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nCommon\nVery rare\n\nNot known\n\nFatigue\nHypersensitivity reactions (such as \nanaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnoea, \npruritus, rash, and urticaria)\nAsthenia\n\nInvestigations Not known Weight increased\n\nPaediatric population\nOther undesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period in paediatric patients with an \nunknown frequency included QT prolongation, arrhythmia, bradycardia, abnormal behaviour, and \naggression.\n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nA retrospective observational safety study indicated an increased incidence of new-onset seizure in \npatients 0 to 19 years of age when receiving desloratadine compared with periods not receiving \ndesloratadine. Among children 0-4 years old, the adjusted absolute increase was 37.5 (95% \nConfidence Interval (CI) 10.5-64.5) per 100,000 person years (PY) with a background rate of new \nonset seizure of 80.3 per 100,000 PY. Among patients 5-19 years of age, the adjusted absolute \nincrease was 11.3 (95% CI 2.3-20.2) per 100,000 PY with a background rate of 36.4 per 100,000 PY. \n(See section 4.4.)\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to \nthat seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher.\n\nTreatment\nIn the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove unabsorbed active substance. \nSymptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended.\n\nDesloratadine is not eliminated by haemodialysis; it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal \ndialysis.\n\nSymptoms\nBased on a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine was administered \n(nine times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to \nthat seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihistamines \u2013 H1 antagonist, ATC code: R06A X27\n\nMechanism of action\nDesloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-\nreceptor antagonist activity. After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral \nhistamine H1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system.\n\nDesloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting \nthe release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast \ncells/basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on \nendothelial cells. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be confirmed.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nIn a multiple dose trial, Neoclarityn orodispersible tablets were well tolerated.\n\nAt the recommended dose, Neoclarityn 5 mg orodispersible tablet was found to be bioequivalent to \nthe Neoclarityn 5 mg conventional tablet formulation of desloratadine. Therefore, the efficacy of \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21\n\nNeoclarityn orodispersible tablet is expected to be the same as with the Neoclarityn tablet \nformulation.\n\nIn a multiple-dose clinical trial, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for \n14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed. In a clinical \npharmacology trial, in which desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the \nclinical dose) for ten days, no prolongation of QTc interval was seen.\n\nNo clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose, \nketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials.\n\nDesloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In clinical trials, at the \nrecommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to \nplacebo. Neoclarityn tablets given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg did not affect psychomotor \nperformance in clinical trials. In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not \naffect standard measures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or \ntasks related to flying.\n\nIn clinical pharmacology trials, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol-induced \nimpairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were found in the \npsychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or \nwith alcohol. \n\nIn patients with allergic rhinitis, Neoclarityn tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as \nsneezing, nasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, and itching of \npalate. Neoclarityn tablets effectively controlled symptoms for 24 hours.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe efficacy of Neoclarityn tablets has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent patients \n12 through 17 years of age.\n\nIn addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can \nalternatively be classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to \nthe duration of symptoms. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less \nthan 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of \nsymptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks.\n\nNeoclarityn was effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total \nscore of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was seen in \nthe domains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms. \n\nChronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the \nunderlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be \nmore easily recruited prospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, \ndesloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial \nconditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines.\n\nIn two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Neoclarityn was \neffective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first \ndosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach ml of oral solution contains 0.5 mg desloratadine.\n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:\nThis medicinal product contains 150 mg/ml of sorbitol\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOral solution\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nNeoclarityn is indicated in adults, adolescents and children over the age of 1 year for the relief of \nsymptoms associated with:\n- allergic rhinitis (see section 5.1)\n- urticaria (see section 5.1)\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nPosology\nAdults and adolescents (12 years of age and over)\nThe recommended dose of Neoclarityn is 10 ml (5 mg) oral solution once a day.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe prescriber should be aware that most cases of rhinitis below 2 years of age are of infectious origin \n(see section 4.4) and there are no data supporting the treatment of infectious rhinitis with Neoclarityn.\n\nChildren 1 through 5 years of age: 2.5 ml (1.25 mg) Neoclarityn oral solution once a day.\n\nChildren 6 through 11 years of age: 5 ml (2.5 mg) Neoclarityn oral solution once a day.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Neoclarityn 0.5 mg/ml oral solution in children below the age of 1 year \nhave not been established.\n\nThere is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in children 1 through \n11 years of age and adolescents 12 through 17 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nIntermittent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than \n4 weeks) should be managed in accordance with the evaluation of patient\u2019s disease history and the \ntreatment could be discontinued after symptoms are resolved and reinitiated upon their reappearance. \nIn persistent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than \n4 weeks), continued treatment may be proposed to the patients during the allergen exposure periods. \n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\nMethod of administration\nOral use.\nThe dose can be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to loratadine. \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nDesloratadine should be administered with caution in patients with medical or familial history of \nseizures, and mainly young children (see section 4.8), being more susceptible to develop new seizures \nunder desloratadine treatment. Healthcare providers may consider discontinuing desloratadine in \npatients who experience a seizure while on treatment.\n\nPaediatric population\nIn children below 2 years of age, the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is particularly difficult to distinguish\nfrom other forms of rhinitis. The absence of upper respiratory tract infection or structural \nabnormalities, as well as patient history, physical examinations, and appropriate laboratory and skin \ntests should be considered.\n\nApproximately 6 % of adults and children 2- to 11-year old are phenotypic poor metabolisers of \ndesloratadine and exhibit a higher exposure (see section 5.2). The safety of desloratadine in children \n2- to 11-years of age who are poor metabolisers is the same as in children who are normal \nmetabolisers. The effects of desloratadine in poor metabolisers < 2 years of age have not been studied.\n\nIn the case of severe renal insufficiency, Neoclarityn should be used with caution (see section 5.2).\n\nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol; thus, patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this \nmedicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which \nerythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1). \n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nIn a clinical pharmacology trial, Neoclarityn tablets taken concomitantly with alcohol did not \npotentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1). However, cases of alcohol \nintolerance and intoxication have been reported during post-marketing use. Therefore, caution is \nrecommended if alcohol is taken concomitantly.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no \nmalformative nor foeto/ neonatal toxicity of desloratadine. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Neoclarityn during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nDesloratadine has been identified in breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. The effect of \ndesloratadine on newborns/infants is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Neoclarityn therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data available on male and female fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNeoclarityn has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines based on clinical \ntrials. Patients should be informed that most people do not experience drowsiness. Nevertheless, as \nthere is individual variation in response to all medicinal products, it is recommended that patients are \nadvised not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or using machines, \nuntil they have established their own response to the medicinal product.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nPaediatric population\nIn clinical trials in a paediatric population, the desloratadine syrup formulation was administered to a \ntotal of 246 children aged 6 months through 11 years. The overall incidence of adverse events in \nchildren 2 through 11 years of age was similar for the desloratadine and the placebo groups. In infants \nand toddlers aged 6 to 23 months, the most frequent adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo \nwere diarrhoea (3.7 %), fever (2.3 %) and insomnia (2.3 %). In an additional study, no adverse events \nwere seen in subjects between 6 and 11 years of age following a single 2.5 mg dose of desloratadine \noral solution.\n\nIn a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 17 years of age, the most common adverse \nevent was headache; this occurred in 5.9 % of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9 % of \npatients receiving placebo.\n\nAdults and adolescents\nAt the recommended dose, in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in a range of indications \nincluding allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, undesirable effects with Neoclarityn were \nreported in 3 % of patients in excess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent of adverse \nevents reported in excess of placebo were fatigue (1.2 %), dry mouth (0.8 %) and headache (0.6 %). \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe frequency of the clinical trial adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo and other \nundesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period are listed in the following table. \nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data).\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions seen with \nNeoclarityn\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nNot known Increased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders Very rare\nNot known\n\nHallucinations\nAbnormal behaviour, aggression\n\nNervous system disorders Common\nCommon (children less \n\nthan 2 years)\nVery rare\n\nHeadache\nInsomnia\n\nDizziness, somnolence, insomnia, \npsychomotor hyperactivity, seizures\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions seen with \nNeoclarityn\n\nCardiac disorders Very rare\nNot known\n\nTachycardia, palpitations\nQT prolongation\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common\nCommon (children less \n\nthan 2 years)\nVery rare\n\nDry mouth\nDiarrhoea\n\nAbdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, \ndyspepsia, diarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Very rare\n\nNot known\n\nElevations of liver enzymes, increased \nbilirubin, hepatitis\nJaundice\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nNot known Photosensitivity\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\n\nVery rare Myalgia\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nCommon\nCommon (children less \n\nthan 2 years)\nVery rare\n\nNot known\n\nFatigue\nFever\n\nHypersensitivity reactions (such as \nanaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnoea, \npruritus, rash, and urticaria)\nAsthenia\n\nInvestigations Not known Weight increased\n\nPaediatric population\nOther undesirable effects reported during the post-marketing period in paediatric patients with an \nunknown frequency included QT prolongation, arrhythmia, bradycardia, abnormal behaviour, and \naggression.\n\nA retrospective observational safety study indicated an increased incidence of new-onset seizure in \npatients 0 to 19 years of age when receiving desloratadine compared with periods not receiving \ndesloratadine. Among children 0-4 years old, the adjusted absolute increase was 37.5 (95% \nConfidence Interval (CI) 10.5-64.5) per 100,000 person years (PY) with a background rate of new \nonset seizure of 80.3 per 100,000 PY. Among patients 5-19 years of age, the adjusted absolute \nincrease was 11.3 (95% CI 2.3-20.2) per 100,000 PY with a background rate of 36.4 per 100,000 PY. \n(See section 4.4.)\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to \nthat seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher.\n\nTreatment\nIn the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove unabsorbed active substance. \nSymptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended.\n\nDesloratadine is not eliminated by haemodialysis; it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal \ndialysis.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n29\n\nSymptoms\nBased on a multiple dose clinical trial in adults and adolescents, in which up to 45 mg of \ndesloratadine was administered (nine times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were \nobserved.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as seen during post-marketing use, is similar to \nthat seen with therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be higher.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihistamines \u2013 H1 antagonist, ATC code: R06A X27\n\nMechanism of action\nDesloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-\nreceptor antagonist activity. After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral \nhistamine H1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system.\n\nDesloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting \nthe release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast \ncells/basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on \nendothelial cells. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be confirmed.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nPaediatric population\nEfficacy of Neoclarityn oral solution has not been investigated in separate paediatric trials. However, \nthe safety of desloratadine syrup formulation, which contains the same concentration of desloratadine\nas Neoclarityn oral solution, was demonstrated in three paediatric trials. Children, 1-11 years of age, \nwho were candidates for antihistamine therapy received a daily desloratadine dose of 1.25 mg \n(1 through 5 years of age) or 2.5 mg (6 through 11 years of age). Treatment was well tolerated as \ndocumented by clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG interval data, including QTc. When \ngiven at the recommended doses, the plasma concentrations of desloratadine (see section 5.2) were \ncomparable in the paediatric and adult populations. Thus, since the course of allergic rhinitis/chronic \nidiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadine are similar in adults and paediatric patients, \ndesloratadine efficacy data in adults can be extrapolated to the paediatric population.\nEfficacy of Neoclarityn syrup has not been investigated in paediatric trials in children less than \n12 years of age.\n\nAdults and adolescents\nIn a multiple dose clinical trial, in adults and adolescents, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was \nadministered daily for 14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was \nobserved. In a clinical pharmacology trial, in adults and adolescents, in which desloratadine was \nadministered to adults at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) for ten days, no \nprolongation of QTc interval was seen.\n\nDesloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. In controlled clinical trials, at the \nrecommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, there was no excess incidence of \nsomnolence as compared to placebo. Neoclarityn tablets given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg to \nadults and adolescents did not affect psychomotor performance in clinical trials. In a single dose study \nperformed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard measures of flight performance \nincluding exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying.\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nIn clinical pharmacology trials in adults, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol-\ninduced impairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were found in\nthe psychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone \nor with alcohol. \n\nNo clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose \nketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials.\n\nIn adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Neoclarityn tablets were effective in relieving \nsymptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, \nand itching of palate. Neoclarityn effectively controlled symptoms for 24 hours. The efficacy of \nNeoclarityn tablets has not been clearly demonstrated in trials with adolescent patients 12 through \n17 years of age.\n\nIn addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can \nalternatively be classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to \nthe duration of symptoms. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less \nthan 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of \nsymptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks.\n\nNeoclarityn tablets were effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by \nthe total score of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was \nseen in the domains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms.\n\nChronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the \nunderlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be \nmore easily recruited prospectively. Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, \ndesloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial \nconditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines.\n\nIn two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Neoclarityn was \neffective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first \ndosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval. As with \nother antihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified \nas non-responsive to antihistamines was excluded. An improvement in pruritus of more than 50 % \nwas observed in 55 % of patients treated with desloratadine compared with 19 % of patients treated \nwith placebo. Treatment with Neoclarityn also significantly reduced interference with sleep and \ndaytime function, as measured by a four-point scale used to assess these variables.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nDesloratadine plasma concentrations can be detected within 30 minutes of desloratadine \nadministration in adults and adolescents. Desloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration \nachieved after approximately 3 hours; the terminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours. The \ndegree of accumulation of desloratadine was consistent with its half-life (approximately 27 hours) and \na once daily dosing frequency. The bioavailability of desloratadine was dose proportional over the \nrange of 5 mg to 20 mg. \n\nIn a series of pharmacokinetic and clinical trials, 6 % of the subjects reached a higher concentration of \ndesloratadine. The prevalence of this poor metaboliser phenotype was comparable for adult (6 %) and \npaediatric subjects 2- to 11-year old (6 %), and greater among Blacks (18 % adult, 16 % paediatric) \nthan Caucasians (2 % adult, 3 % paediatric) in both populations.\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\nIn a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study conducted with the tablet formulation in healthy adult \nsubjects, four subjects were found to be poor metabolisers of desloratadine. These subjects had a Cmax\nconcentration about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of \napproximately 89 hours.\n\nSimilar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study \nconducted with the syrup formulation in paediatric poor metaboliser subjects 2- to 11-year old \ndiagnosed with allergic rhinitis. The exposure (AUC) to desloratadine was about 6-fold higher and the \nCmax was about 3 to 4 fold higher at 3-6 hours with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours. \nExposure was the same in adult and paediatric poor metabolisers when treated with age-appropriate \ndoses. The overall safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general \npopulation. The effects of desloratadine in poor metabolizers < 2 years of age have not been studied.\n\nIn separate single dose studies, at the recommended doses, paediatric patients had comparable AUC \nand Cmax values of desloratadine to those in adults who received a 5 mg dose of desloratadine syrup.\n\nDistribution\nDesloratadine is moderately bound (83 % - 87 %) to plasma proteins. There is no evidence of \nclinically relevant active substance accumulation following once daily adult and adolescent dosing of \ndesloratadine (5 mg to 20 mg) for 14 days. \n\nIn a single dose, crossover study of desloratadine, the tablet and the syrup formulations were found to \nbe bioequivalent. As Neoclarityn oral solution contains the same concentration of desloratadine, no \nbioequivalence study was required and it is expected to be equivalent to the syrup and tablet.\n\nBiotransformation\nThe enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and \ntherefore, some interactions with other medicinal products cannot be fully excluded. Desloratadine \ndoes not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not \ninhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.\n\nElimination\nIn a single dose trial using a 7.5 mg dose of desloratadine, there was no effect of food (high-fat, high \ncaloric breakfast) on the disposition of desloratadine. In another study, grapefruit juice had no effect \non the disposition of desloratadine.\n\nRenally impaired patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of desloratadine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was \ncompared with that of healthy subjects in one single-dose study and one multiple dose study. In the\nsingle-dose study, the exposure to desloratadine was approximately 2 and 2.5-fold greater in subjects \nwith mild to moderate and severe CRI, respectively, than in healthy subjects. In the multiple-dose \nstudy, steady state was reached after Day 11, and compared to healthy subjects the exposure to \ndesloratadine was ~1.5-fold greater in subjects with mild to moderate CRI and ~2.5-fold greater in \nsubjects with severe CRI. In both studies, changes in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine and \n3-hydroxydesloratadine were not clinically relevant.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nDesloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Non-clinical studies conducted with \ndesloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in \nthe toxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine. \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction\nand development. The lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with \ndesloratadine and loratadine.\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\n6.

What Neoclarityn is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Neoclarityn is\nNeoclarityn contains desloratadine which is an antihistamine.\n\nHow Neoclarityn works\nNeoclarityn is an antiallergy medicine that does not make you drowsy. It helps control your allergic \nreaction and its symptoms.\n\nWhen Neoclarityn should be used\nNeoclarityn relieves symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages \ncaused by an allergy, for example, hay fever or allergy to dust mites) in adults and adolescents \n12 years of age and older. These symptoms include sneezing, runny or itchy nose, itchy palate, and \nitchy, red or watery eyes. \n\nNeoclarityn is also used to relieve the symptoms associated with urticaria (a skin condition caused by \nan allergy). These symptoms include itching and hives.\n\nRelief of these symptoms lasts a full day and helps you to resume your normal daily activities and \nsleep.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Neoclarityn\n\nDo not take Neoclarityn\n- if you are allergic to desloratadine, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) or to loratadine.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Neoclarityn:\n- if you have poor kidney function.\n- if you have medical or familial history of seizures.\n\n \n\n\n\n57\n\nUse in children and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to children less than 12 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Neoclarityn\nThere are no known interactions of Neoclarityn with other medicines.\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nNeoclarityn with food, drink and alcohol\nNeoclarityn may be taken with or without a meal. \nUse caution when taking Neoclarityn with alcohol.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor, or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\nTaking Neoclarityn is not recommended if you are pregnant or nursing a baby.\nFertility\nThere is no data available on male/female fertility.\n\nDriving and using machines\nAt the recommended dose, this medicine is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use \nmachines. Although most people do not experience drowsiness, it is recommended not to engage in \nactivities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating machinery until you have \nestablished your own response to the medicinal product. \n\nNeoclarityn contains lactose\nNeoclarityn tablets contain lactose.

No serious problems are expected with accidental \noverdose. However, if you take more Neoclarityn than you were told to, tell your doctor, pharmacist \nor nurse immediately.\n\nIf you forget to take Neoclarityn\nIf you forget to take your dose on time, take it as soon as possible and then go back to your regular \ndosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Neoclarityn\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4.
