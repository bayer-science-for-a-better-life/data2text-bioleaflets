CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nAnagrelide is indicated for the reduction of elevated platelet counts in at risk essential \n\nthrombocythaemia (ET) patients who are intolerant to their current therapy or whose elevated platelet \n\ncounts are not reduced to an acceptable level by their current therapy. \n\n \n\nAn at-risk patient \n\nAn at-risk essential thrombocythaemia patient is defined by one or more of the following features: \n\n\u2022 > 60 years of age or \n\n\u2022 a platelet count >1,000 x 109/l or \n\n\u2022 a history of thrombo-haemorrhagic events.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment with anagrelide should be initiated by a clinician with experience in the management of \n\nessential thrombocythaemia. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose of anagrelide is 1 mg/day, which should be administered orally in two \n\ndivided doses (0.5 mg/dose). \n\n \n\nThe starting dose should be maintained for at least one week. After one week the dose may be titrated, \n\non an individual basis, to achieve the lowest effective dose required to reduce and/or maintain a \n\nplatelet count below 600 x 109/l and ideally at levels between 150 x 109/l and 400 x 109/l. The dose \n\nincrement must not exceed more than 0.5 mg/day in any one week and the recommended maximum \n\nsingle dose should not exceed 2.5 mg (see section 4.9). During clinical development doses of \n\n10 mg/day have been used. \n\n \n\nThe effects of treatment with anagrelide must be monitored on a regular basis (see section 4.4). If the \n\nstarting dose is > 1 mg/day, platelet counts should be performed every two days during the first week \n\nof treatment and at least weekly thereafter until a stable maintenance dose is reached. Typically, a fall \n\nin the platelet count will be observed within 14 to 21 days of starting treatment and in most patients an \n\nadequate therapeutic response will be observed and maintained at a dose of 1 to 3 mg/day (for further \n\ninformation on the clinical effects refer, to section 5.1). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThe observed pharmacokinetic differences between elderly and young patients with ET (see section \n\n5.2) do not warrant using a different starting regimen or different dose titration step to achieve an \n\nindividual patient-optimised anagrelide regimen. \n\n \n\nDuring clinical development, approximately 50% of the patients treated with anagrelide were over \n\n60 years of age and no age specific alterations in dose were required in these patients. However, as \n\nexpected, patients in this age group had twice the incidence of serious adverse events (mainly cardiac). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data for this patient population. The potential risks and benefits of \n\nanagrelide therapy in a patient with impairment of renal function should be assessed before treatment \n\nis commenced (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data for this patient population. However, hepatic metabolism \n\nrepresents the major route of anagrelide clearance and liver function may therefore be expected to \n\ninfluence this process. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with moderate or severe hepatic \n\nimpairment are not treated with anagrelide. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a \n\npatient with mild impairment of hepatic function should be assessed before treatment is commenced \n\n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of anagrelide in children have not been established. The experience in children \n\nand adolescents is very limited; anagrelide should be used in this patient group with caution. In the \n\nabsence of specific paediatric guidelines, WHO diagnostic criteria for adult diagnosis of ET are \n\nconsidered to be of relevance to the paediatric population. Diagnostic guidelines for essential \n\nthrombocythaemia should be followed carefully and diagnosis reassessed periodically in cases of \n\nuncertainty, with effort made to distinguish from hereditary or secondary thrombocytosis, which may \n\ninclude genetic analysis and bone marrow biopsy. \n\n \n\nTypically, cytoreductive therapy is considered in high-risk paediatric patients. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nAnagrelide treatment should only be initiated when the patient shows signs of disease progression or \n\nsuffers from thrombosis. If treatment is initiated, the benefits and risks of treatment with anagrelide \n\nmust be monitored regularly and the need for ongoing treatment evaluated periodically. \n\n \n\nPlatelet targets are assigned on an individual patient basis by the treating physician. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment should be considered in paediatric patients who do not have a satisfactory \n\ntreatment response after approximately 3 months. \n\n \n\nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a \n\nposology can be made. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor oral use. The capsules must be swallowed whole. The contents of the capsules should not be \n\ncrushed or diluted in a liquid. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nPatients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. \n\nPatients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nThe potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild impairment of hepatic \n\nfunction should be assessed before treatment is commenced. It is not recommended in patients with \n\nelevated transaminases (>5 times the upper limit of normal) (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nThe potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with impairment of renal function \n\nshould be assessed before treatment is commenced (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\nMonitoring \n\n \n\nTherapy requires close clinical supervision of the patient which will include a full blood count \n\n(haemoglobin and white blood cell and platelet counts), assessment of liver function (ALT and AST), \n\nrenal function (serum creatinine and urea) and electrolytes (potassium, magnesium and calcium). \n\n \n\nPlatelets \n\n \n\nThe platelet count will increase within 4 days of stopping treatment with anagrelide and will return to \n\npre-treatment levels within 10 to 14 days, possibly rebounding above baseline values. Therefore, \n\nplatelets should be monitored frequently. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\n \n\nSerious cardiovascular adverse reactions including cases of torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, \n\ncardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure have been reported (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nCaution should be taken when using anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for prolongation of \n\nthe QT interval, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, \n\nmedicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalaemia. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nCare should also be taken in populations that may have a higher maximum plasma concentration \n\n(Cmax) of anagrelide or its active metabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, e.g., hepatic impairment or use \n\nwith CYP1A2 inhibitors (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nClose monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. \n\n \n\nA pre-treatment cardiovascular examination, including a baseline ECG and echocardiography is \n\nrecommended for all patients prior to initiating therapy with anagrelide. All patients should be \n\nmonitored regularly during treatment (e.g., ECG or echocardiography) for evidence of cardiovascular \n\neffects that may require further cardiovascular examination and investigation. Hypokalaemia or \n\nhypomagnesaemia must be corrected prior to anagrelide administration and should be monitored \n\nperiodically during therapy. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III and because of its positive inotropic \n\nand chronotropic effects, anagrelide should be used with caution in patients of any age with known or \n\nsuspected heart disease. Moreover, serious cardiovascular adverse events have also occurred in \n\npatients without suspected heart disease and with normal pre-treatment cardiovascular examination. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide should only be used if the potential benefits of therapy outweigh the potential risks. \n\n \n\nPulmonary hypertension  \n\n \n\nCases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in patients treated with anagrelide. Patients \n\nshould be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating \n\nand during anagrelide therapy.    \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nVery limited data are available on the use of anagrelide in the paediatric population and anagrelide \n\nshould be used in this patient group with caution (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAs with the adult population, a full blood count and assessment of cardiac, hepatic and renal function \n\nshould be undertaken before treatment and regularly during treatment. The disease may progress to \n\nmyelofibrosis or AML. Although the rate of such progression is not known, children have a longer \n\ndisease course and may, therefore, be at increased risk for malignant transformation, relative to adults. \n\nChildren should be monitored regularly for disease progression according to standard clinical \n\npractices, such as physical examination, assessment of relevant disease markers and bone marrow \n\nbiopsy. \n\n \n\nAny abnormalities should be evaluated promptly and appropriate measures taken, which may also \n\ninclude dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation. \n\n \n\nClinically relevant interactions \n\n \n\nAnagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III (PDE III). Concomitant use of \n\nanagrelide with other PDE III inhibitors such as milrinone, amrinone, enoximone, olprinone and \n\ncilostazol is not recommended. \n\n \n\nUse of concomitant anagrelide and acetylsalicylic acid has been associated with major haemorrhagic \n\nevents (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nAnagrelide Mylan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \n\ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide Mylan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nLimited pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic studies investigating possible interactions between \n\nanagrelide and other medicinal products have been conducted. \n\n \n\nEffects of other active substances on anagrelide \n\n \n\n\u2022 In vivo interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that digoxin and warfarin do not affect \nthe pharmacokinetic properties of anagrelide. \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 inhibitors \n\n\u2022 Anagrelide is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2. It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by \nseveral medicinal products, including fluvoxamine and enoxacin, and such medicinal products \n\ncould theoretically adversely influence the clearance of anagrelide. \n\n \n\nCYP1A2 inducers \n\n\u2022 CYP1A2 inducers (such as omeprazole) could decrease the exposure of anagrelide increasing its \nmain active metabolite. The consequences on the safety and efficacy profile of anagrelide are \n\nnot established. Therefore, clinical and biological monitoring is recommended in patients taking \n\nconcomitant CYP1A2 inducers. If needed, anagrelide dose adjustment could be made.    \n\n \n\nEffects of anagrelide on other active substances \n\n \n\n\u2022 Anagrelide demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present \na theoretical potential for interaction with other co-administered medicinal products sharing that \n\nclearance mechanism e.g., theophylline. \n\n\u2022 Anagrelide is an inhibitor of PDE III. The effects of medicinal products with similar properties \nsuch as the inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be \n\nexacerbated by anagrelide. \n\n\u2022 In vivo interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that anagrelide does not affect the \npharmacokinetic properties of digoxin or warfarin. \n\n\u2022 At the doses recommended for use in the treatment of essential thrombocythaemia, anagrelide \nmay potentiate the effects of other medicinal products that inhibit or modify platelet function \n\ne.g., acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n\u2022 A clinical interaction study performed in healthy subjects showed that co-administration of \nrepeat-dose anagrelide 1 mg once daily and acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg once daily may enhance \n\nthe anti-platelet aggregation effects of each active substance compared with administration of \n\nacetylsalicylic acid alone. In some patients with ET concomitantly treated by acetylsalicylic \n\nacid and anagrelide, major haemorrhages occurred. Therefore, the potential risks of the \n\nconcomitant use of anagrelide with acetylsalicylic acid should be assessed, particularly in \n\npatients with a high-risk profile for haemorrhage before treatment is initiated. \n\n\u2022 Anagrelide may cause intestinal disturbance in some patients and compromise the absorption of \nhormonal oral contraceptives. \n\n \n\nFood interactions \n\n \n\n\u2022 Food delays the absorption of anagrelide, but does not significantly alter systemic exposure. \n\n\u2022 The effects of food on bioavailability are not considered clinically relevant to the use of \nanagrelide. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential should use adequate birth-control measures during treatment with \n\nanagrelide. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of anagrelide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore, \n\nanagrelide is not recommended during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nIf anagrelide is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using the medicinal \n\nproduct, she should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether anagrelide/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in animals \n\nhave shown excretion of anagrelide/metabolites in milk. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be \n\nexcluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with anagrelide. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo human data on the effect of anagrelide on fertility are available. In male rats, there was no effect \n\non fertility or reproductive performance with anagrelide. In female rats, using doses in excess of the \n\ntherapeutic range, anagrelide disrupted implantation (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nIn clinical development, dizziness was commonly reported. Patients are advised not to drive or operate \n\nmachinery while taking anagrelide if dizziness is experienced. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety of anagrelide has been examined in 4 open label clinical studies. In 3 of the studies \n\n942 patients who received anagrelide at a mean dose of approximately 2 mg/day were assessed for \n\nsafety.  \n\nIn these studies, 22 patients received anagrelide for up to 4 years. \n\n \n\nIn the later study 3,660 patients who received anagrelide at a mean dose of approximately 2 mg/day \n\nwere assessed for safety. In this study 34 patients received anagrelide for up to 5 years. \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with anagrelide were headache occurring at \n\napproximately 14%, palpitations occurring at approximately 9%, fluid retention and nausea both \n\noccurring at approximately 6% and diarrhoea occurring at 5%. These adverse drug reactions are \n\nexpected based on the pharmacology of anagrelide (inhibition of PDE III). Gradual dose titration may \n\nhelp diminish these effects (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions arising from clinical studies, post-authorisation safety studies and spontaneous \n\nreports are presented in the table below. Within the system organ classes they are listed under the \n\nfollowing headings: Very common (\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n\n<1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \n\nthe available data).

However, safety data \n\nare limited and do not allow a meaningful comparison between adult and paediatric patients to be \n\nmade (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nPost-marketing case reports of intentional overdose with anagrelide have been received. Reported \n\nsymptoms include sinus tachycardia and vomiting. Symptoms resolved with conservative \n\nmanagement. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide, at higher than recommended doses, has been shown to produce reductions in blood \n\npressure with occasional instances of hypotension. A single 5-mg dose of anagrelide can lead to a fall \n\nin blood pressure usually accompanied by dizziness. \n\n \n\nA specific antidote for anagrelide has not been identified. In case of overdose, close clinical \n\nsupervision of the patient is required; this includes monitoring of the platelet count for \n\nthrombocytopenia. Dose should be decreased or stopped, as appropriate, until the platelet count returns \n\nto within the normal range. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX35. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nThe precise mechanism by which anagrelide reduces blood platelet count is unknown. In cell culture \n\nstudies, anagrelide suppressed expression of transcription factors including GATA-1 and FOG-1 \n\nrequired for megakaryocytopoiesis, ultimately leading to reduced platelet production. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies of human megakaryocytopoiesis established that anagrelide\u2019s inhibitory actions on \n\nplatelet formation in man are mediated via retardation of maturation of megakaryocytes, and reducing \n\ntheir size and ploidy. Evidence of similar in vivo actions was observed in bone marrow biopsy samples \n\nfrom treated patients. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of anagrelide as a platelet lowering agent have been evaluated in four open-\n\nlabel, non-controlled clinical trials (study numbers 700-012, 700-014, 700-999 and 13970-301) \n\nincluding more than 4,000 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In patients with \n\nessential thrombocythaemia complete response was defined as a decrease in platelet count to \n\n\u2264600 x 109/l or a \u226550% reduction from baseline and maintenance of the reduction for at least 4 weeks. \n\nIn studies 700-012, 700-014, 700-999 and study 13970-301 the time to complete response ranged from \n\n4 to 12 weeks. Clinical benefit in terms of thrombohaemorrhagic events has not been convincingly \n\ndemonstrated. \n\n \n\nEffects on heart rate and QTc interval \n\n \n\nThe effect of two dose levels of anagrelide (0.5 mg and 2.5 mg single doses) on the heart rate and QTc \n\ninterval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo- and active-controlled, cross-over study \n\nin healthy adult men and women. \n\n \n\nA dose-related increase in heart rate was observed during the first 12 hours, with the maximum \n\nincrease occurring around the time of maximal concentrations. The maximum change in mean heart \n\nrate occurred at 2 hours after administration and was +7.8 beats per minute (bpm) for 0.5 mg and \n\n+29.1 bpm for 2.5 mg. \n\n \n\nA transient increase in mean QTc was observed for both doses during periods of increasing heart rate \n\nand the maximum change in mean QTcF (Fridericia correction) was +5.0 msec occurring at 2 hours \n\nfor 0.5 mg and +10.0 msec occurring at 1 hour for 2.5 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIn an open-label clinical study in 8 children and 10 adolescents (including patients who were \n\nanagrelide treatment na\u00efve or who had been receiving anagrelide for up to 5 years pre-study), median \n\nplatelet counts were decreased to controlled levels after 12 weeks of treatment. The average daily dose \n\ntended to be higher in adolescents. \n\n \n\nIn a paediatric registry study, median platelet counts were reduced from diagnosis and maintained for \n\nup to 18 months in 14 paediatric patients with ET (4 children, 10 adolescents) with anagrelide \n\ntreatment. In earlier, open-label studies, median platelet count reductions were observed in 7 children \n\nand 9 adolescents treated for between 3 months and 6.5 years. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nThe average total daily dose of anagrelide across all studies in paediatric patients with ET was highly \n\nvariable, but overall the data suggest that adolescents could follow similar starting and maintenance \n\ndoses to adults and that a lower starting dose of 0.5 mg/day would be more appropriate for children \n\nover 6 years (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.2). In all paediatric patients, careful titration to a patient-\n\nspecific daily dose is needed. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration of anagrelide in man, at least 70% is absorbed from the gastrointestinal \n\ntract. In fasted subjects, peak plasma levels occur about 1 hour after administration. Pharmacokinetic \n\ndata from healthy subjects established that food decreases the Cmax of anagrelide by 14%, but increases \n\nthe AUC by 20%. Food also decreased the Cmax of the active metabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, by \n\n29%, although it had no effect on the AUC. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nAnagrelide is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 to form, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, which is further \n\nmetabolised via CYP1A2 to the inactive metabolite, 2-amino-5, 6-dichloro-3, 4-dihydroquinazoline. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe plasma half-life of anagrelide is short, approximately 1.3 hours and as expected from its half-life, \n\nthere is no evidence for anagrelide accumulation in the plasma. Less than 1% is recovered in the urine \n\nas anagrelide. The mean recovery of 2-amino-5, 6-dichloro-3, 4-dihydroquinazoline in urine is \n\napproximately 18-35% of the administered dose. \n\n \n\nAdditionally these results show no evidence of auto-induction of the anagrelide clearance. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\n \n\nDose proportionality has been found in the dose range 0.5 mg to 2 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic data from exposed fasting children and adolescents (age range 7 through 16 years) \n\nwith essential thrombocythaemia indicate that dose normalised exposure, Cmax and AUC, of anagrelide \n\ntended to be higher in children/adolescents compared with adults. There was also a trend to higher \n\ndose-normalised exposure to the active metabolite. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic data from fasting elderly patients with ET (age range 65 through 75 years) compared \n\nto fasting adult patients (age range 22 through 50 years) indicate that the Cmax and AUC of anagrelide \n\nwere 36% and 61% higher respectively in elderly patients, but that the Cmax and AUC of the active \n\nmetabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, were 42% and 37% lower respectively in the elderly patients. These \n\ndifferences were likely to be caused by lower presystemic metabolism of anagrelide to 3-hydroxy \n\nanagrelide in the elderly patients. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRepeated dose toxicity \n\n \n\nFollowing repeated oral administration of anagrelide in dogs, subendocardial haemorrhage and focal \n\nmyocardial necrosis was observed at 1 mg/kg/day or higher in males and females with males being \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nmore sensitive. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for male dogs (0.3 mg/kg/day) corresponds to \n\n0.1-, 0.1-, and 1.6-fold the AUC in humans for anagrelide at 2 mg/day, and the metabolites BCH24426 \n\nand RL603, respectively. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nIn male rats, anagrelide at oral doses up to 240 mg/kg/day (>1,000 times a 2-mg/day dose, based on \n\nbody surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance. In female \n\nrats increases in pre- and post-implantation losses and a decrease in the mean number of live embryos \n\nwas observed at 30 mg/kg/day. The NOEL (10 mg/kg/day) to this effect was 143-, 12- and 11-fold \n\nhigher than the AUC in humans administered a dose of anagrelide 2 mg/day, and the metabolites \n\nBCH24426 and RL603, respectively. \n\n \n\nEmbryofoetal development studies \n\nMaternally toxic doses of anagrelide in rats and rabbits were associated with increased embryo \n\nresorption and foetal mortality. \n\n \n\nIn a pre- and post-natal development study in female rats, anagrelide at oral doses of \u226510 mg/kg \n\nproduced a non-adverse increase in gestational duration. At the NOEL dose (3 mg/kg/day), the AUCs \n\nfor anagrelide and the metabolites BCH24426 and RL603 were 14-, 2- and 2-fold higher than the \n\nAUC in humans administered an oral dose of anagrelide 2 mg/day. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide at \u2265 60 mg/kg increased parturition time and mortality in the dam and foetus, respectively. \n\nAt the NOEL dose (30 mg/kg/day), the AUCs for anagrelide and the metabolites BCH24426 and \n\nRL603 were 425-, 31- and 13-fold higher than the AUC in humans administered an oral dose of \n\nanagrelide 2 mg/day, respectively. \n\n \n\nMutagenic and carcinogenic potential \n\n \n\nStudies on the genotoxic potential of anagrelide did not identify any mutagenic or clastogenic effects. \n\n \n\nIn a two-year rat carcinogenicity study, non-neoplastic and neoplastic findings were observed and \n\nrelated or attributed to an exaggerated pharmacological effect. Among them, the incidence of adrenal \n\nphaeochromocytomas was increased relative to control in males at all dose levels (\u22653 mg/kg/day) and \n\nin females receiving 10 mg/kg/day and above. The lowest dose in males (3 mg/kg/day) corresponds to \n\n37 times the human AUC exposure after a 1 mg twice daily dose. Uterine adenocarcinomas, of \n\nepigenetic origin, could be related to an enzyme induction of CYP1 family. They were observed in \n\nfemales receiving 30 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 572 times the human AUC exposure after a 1-mg \n\ntwice daily dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Anagrelide Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Anagrelide Mylan \n\n3. How to take Anagrelide Mylan \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Anagrelide Mylan \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Anagrelide Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nAnagrelide Mylan contains the active substance, anagrelide. Anagrelide is a medicine which interferes \n\nwith the development of platelets. It reduces the number of platelets produced by the bone marrow, \n\nwhich results in a decrease in the platelet count in the blood towards a more normal level. For this \n\nreason, it is used to treat patients with essential thrombocythaemia. \n\n \n\nEssential thrombocythaemia is a condition which occurs when the bone marrow produces too many of \n\nthe blood cells known as platelets. Large numbers of platelets in the blood can cause serious problems \n\nwith blood circulation and clotting. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Anagrelide Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Anagrelide Mylan \n\n\u2022 If you are allergic to anagrelide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash, itching, swollen face or lips, or \n\nshortness of breath; \n\n\u2022 If you have moderate or severe liver problems; \n\n\u2022 If you have moderate or severe kidney problems. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Anagrelide Mylan: \n\n\u2022 If you have or think you might have a problem with your heart; \n\n\u2022 If you were born with or have family history of prolonged QT interval (seen on ECG, electrical \nrecording of the heart), or you are taking other medicines that result in abnormal ECG changes \n\nor if you have low levels of electrolytes e.g., potassium, magnesium or calcium (see section \n\n\u201cOther medicines and Anagrelide Mylan\u201d); \n\n\u2022 If you have any problems with your liver or kidneys. \n \n\nIn combination with acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain \n\nand lower fever, as well as to prevent blood clotting, also known as aspirin), there is an increased risk \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nof major haemorrhages (bleeding) (see section \u201cOther medicines and Anagrelide Mylan\u201d). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is limited information on the use of anagrelide in children and adolescents and therefore this \n\nmedicine should be used with caution. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Anagrelide Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n\u2022 Medicines that can alter your heart rhythm e.g., sotalol, amiodarone; \n\n\u2022 Fluvoxamine, used to treat depression; \n\n\u2022 Certain types of antibiotic, such as enoxacin, used to treat infections; \n\n\u2022 Theophylline, used to treat severe asthma and breathing problems; \n\n\u2022 Medicines used to treat heart disorders, for example, milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, \nolprinone and cilostazol; \n\n\u2022 Acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower \nfever, as well as to prevent blood clotting, also known as aspirin); \n\n\u2022 Other medicines used to treat conditions affecting the platelets in your blood, e.g., clopidogrel; \n\n\u2022 Omeprazole, used to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach; \n\n\u2022 Oral contraceptives: If you experience bad diarrhoea whilst taking this medicine, it may reduce \nhow well the oral contraceptive works and use of an extra method of contraception is \n\nrecommended (e.g., condom). See the instructions in the patient leaflet of the contraceptive pill \n\nyou are taking. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide or these medicines may not work properly if taken together. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure, speak to your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Anagrelide Mylan should not \n\nbe taken by pregnant women. Women who are at risk of becoming pregnant should make sure that \n\nthey are using effective contraception when taking anagrelide. Speak to your doctor if you need advice \n\nwith contraception. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or if you are planning to breast-feed your baby. Anagrelide \n\nMylan should not be taken while breast-feeding. You must stop breast-feeding if you are taking \n\nAnagrelide Mylan. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDizziness has been reported by some patients taking anagrelide. Do not drive or use machines if you \n\nfeel dizzy. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide Mylan contains lactose and sodium \n\nThis medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to \n\nsome sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Anagrelide Mylan \n \n\nAlways take Anagrelide Mylan exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe amount of anagrelide that people take can be different, and this depends on your condition. Your \n\ndoctor will prescribe the best dose for you. \n\n \n\nThe usual starting dose of this medicine is 1 mg. You take this dose as one capsule of 0.5 mg twice a \n\nday, for at least a week. After this time, your doctor may either increase or decrease the number of \n\ncapsules that you take to find the dose best suited to you and which treats your condition most \n\neffectively. \n\n \n\nYour capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not crush the capsules or dilute \n\nthe contents in a liquid. You can take the capsules with food or after a meal or on an empty stomach. It \n\nis best to take the capsule(s) at the same time every day. \n\n \n\nDo not take more capsules than your doctor has recommended. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will ask you to have blood tests at regular intervals to check that your medicine is \n\nworking effectively and that your liver and kidneys are working well. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Anagrelide Mylan than you should \n\nIf you take more Anagrelide Mylan than you should or if someone else has taken your medicine, tell a \n\ndoctor or pharmacist immediately. Show them the pack of Anagrelide Mylan. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Anagrelide Mylan \n\nTake your capsules as soon as you remember. Take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take a \n\ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Anagrelide Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nAnagrelide Mylan contains the active substance, anagrelide. Anagrelide is a medicine which interferes \n\nwith the development of platelets. It reduces the number of platelets produced by the bone marrow, \n\nwhich results in a decrease in the platelet count in the blood towards a more normal level. For this \n\nreason, it is used to treat patients with essential thrombocythaemia. \n\n \n\nEssential thrombocythaemia is a condition which occurs when the bone marrow produces too many of \n\nthe blood cells known as platelets. Large numbers of platelets in the blood can cause serious problems \n\nwith blood circulation and clotting. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Anagrelide Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Anagrelide Mylan \n\n\u2022 If you are allergic to anagrelide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). An allergic reaction may be recognised as a rash, itching, swollen face or lips, or \n\nshortness of breath; \n\n\u2022 If you have moderate or severe liver problems; \n\n\u2022 If you have moderate or severe kidney problems. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Anagrelide Mylan: \n\n\u2022 If you have or think you might have a problem with your heart; \n\n\u2022 If you were born with or have family history of prolonged QT interval (seen on ECG, electrical \nrecording of the heart), or you are taking other medicines that result in abnormal ECG changes \n\nor if you have low levels of electrolytes e.g., potassium, magnesium or calcium (see section \n\n\u201cOther medicines and Anagrelide Mylan\u201d); \n\n\u2022 If you have any problems with your liver or kidneys. \n \n\nIn combination with acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain \n\nand lower fever, as well as to prevent blood clotting, also known as aspirin), there is an increased risk \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nof major haemorrhages (bleeding) (see section \u201cOther medicines and Anagrelide Mylan\u201d). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is limited information on the use of anagrelide in children and adolescents and therefore this \n\nmedicine should be used with caution. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Anagrelide Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\n\u2022 Medicines that can alter your heart rhythm e.g., sotalol, amiodarone; \n\n\u2022 Fluvoxamine, used to treat depression; \n\n\u2022 Certain types of antibiotic, such as enoxacin, used to treat infections; \n\n\u2022 Theophylline, used to treat severe asthma and breathing problems; \n\n\u2022 Medicines used to treat heart disorders, for example, milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, \nolprinone and cilostazol; \n\n\u2022 Acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower \nfever, as well as to prevent blood clotting, also known as aspirin); \n\n\u2022 Other medicines used to treat conditions affecting the platelets in your blood, e.g., clopidogrel; \n\n\u2022 Omeprazole, used to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach; \n\n\u2022 Oral contraceptives: If you experience bad diarrhoea whilst taking this medicine, it may reduce \nhow well the oral contraceptive works and use of an extra method of contraception is \n\nrecommended (e.g., condom). See the instructions in the patient leaflet of the contraceptive pill \n\nyou are taking. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide or these medicines may not work properly if taken together. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure, speak to your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Anagrelide Mylan should not \n\nbe taken by pregnant women. Women who are at risk of becoming pregnant should make sure that \n\nthey are using effective contraception when taking anagrelide. Speak to your doctor if you need advice \n\nwith contraception. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or if you are planning to breast-feed your baby. Anagrelide \n\nMylan should not be taken while breast-feeding. You must stop breast-feeding if you are taking \n\nAnagrelide Mylan. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDizziness has been reported by some patients taking anagrelide. Do not drive or use machines if you \n\nfeel dizzy. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide Mylan contains lactose and sodium \n\nThis medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to \n\nsome sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Anagrelide Mylan \n \n\nAlways take Anagrelide Mylan exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe amount of anagrelide that people take can be different, and this depends on your condition. Your \n\ndoctor will prescribe the best dose for you. \n\n \n\nThe usual starting dose of anagrelide is 1 mg. You take this dose as one capsule of 0.5 mg twice a day, \n\nfor at least a week. After this time, your doctor may either increase or decrease the number of capsules \n\nthat you take to find the dose best suited to you and which treats your condition most effectively. \n\n \n\nYour capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not crush the capsules or dilute \n\nthe contents in a liquid. You can take the capsules with food or after a meal or on an empty stomach. It \n\nis best to take the capsule(s) at the same time every day. \n\n \n\nDo not take more capsules than your doctor has recommended. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will ask you to have blood tests at regular intervals to check that your medicine is \n\nworking effectively and that your liver and kidneys are working well. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Anagrelide Mylan than you should \n\nIf you take more Anagrelide Mylan than you should or if someone else has taken your medicine, tell a \n\ndoctor or pharmacist immediately.
