NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nZalmoxis 5-20 x 106 cells/mL dispersion for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\n2.1 General description \n\n \n\nAllogeneic T cells genetically modified with a retroviral vector encoding for a truncated form of the \n\nhuman low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (\u0394LNGFR) and the herpes simplex I virus thymidine \n\nkinase (HSV-TK Mut2). \n\n \n\n2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition \n\n \n\nEach bag of Zalmoxis contains a volume of 10-100 mL of frozen dispersion at the concentration of \n\n5-20 x 106 cells/mL. The cells are of human origin and genetically modified with a replication-\n\ndefective \u03b3-retroviral vector coding for the HSV-TK and \u0394LNGFR genes so that these sequences are \n\nintegrated in the genome of the host cells. \n\n \n\nThe cellular composition and the final cell number will vary according to the weight of the patient. In \n\naddition to T cells, NK cells and residual levels of monocytes and of B cells may be present. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\n \n\nEach bag contains approximately 13.3 mmol (305.63 mg) of sodium per dose. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nDispersion for infusion. \n\nOpaque, off-white frozen dispersion. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nZalmoxis is indicated as adjunctive treatment in haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell \n\ntransplantation (HSCT) of adult patients with high-risk haematological malignancies (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nZalmoxis must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in HSCT for \n\nhaematological malignancies.  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose and schedule is 1 \u00b1 0.2 x 107 cells/kg given as an intravenous infusion at a \n\ntime interval of 21-49 days from transplantation, in the absence of spontaneous immune reconstitution \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nand/or development of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Additional infusions are administered at \n\napproximately one month intervals for a maximum of four times, until a circulating T lymphocyte \n\ncount is equal to or more than 100 per \u00b5L. \n\n \n\nZalmoxis should not be administered if the circulating T lymphocytes are \u2265100 per \u03bcL at the day of \n\nplanned infusion after haploidentical HSCT. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy in children and adolescents (less than 18 years) have not been established. No \n\ndata are available. Zalmoxis is therefore not recommended for use in children and adolescent below 18 \n\nyears. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nZalmoxis is solely for use as patient specific medicinal product to be administered after HSCT and it is \n\nadministered by intravenous infusion. \n\n \n\nZalmoxis should be infused intravenously over a period of 20-60 minutes. The entire volume of the \n\nbag should be infused. \n\n \n\nIf the infusion must be interrupted, it should not be resumed if the infusion bag has been held at room \n\ntemperature (15 \u00b0C-30 \u00b0C) for more than 2 hours. \n\n \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n\nBefore infusion it must be confirmed that the patient identity matches the essential unique information \n\nreported on the Zalmoxis bag label and on the related Certificate of Analysis (CoA). \n\n \n\nThe bag should be removed from the liquid nitrogen, put in a double bag container and thawed in a \n\npre-warmed water bath at 37 \u00b0C. Upon full cell dispersion thawing, the bag is dried, disinfected and \n\nready to be infused at a rate prescribed by the physician. Once the bag is infused, it is flushed 2 to 3 \n\ntimes with sodium chloride solution in order to completely administer Zalmoxis. The entire volume of \n\nthe bag has to be infused. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nImmune reconstitution defined as circulating T lymphocytes \u2265100 per \u03bcL at the day of planned \n\ninfusion after haploidentical HSCT. \n\n \n\nGvHD requiring systemic immunosupressive therapy. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nZalmoxis is a patient specific product and should under no circumstances be administered to other \n\npatients. It must not be administered if the following conditions occur: \n\na) infections requiring administration of ganciclovir (GCV) or valganciclovir (VCV) at the time \n\nof infusion; \n\nb) GvHD requiring systemic immunosupressive therapy; \n\nc) ongoing systemic immunosupressive therapy or administration of granulocyte colony \n\nstimulating factor (G-CSF) after haploidentical HSCT. \n\n \n\nPatients characterized by condition a) could be administered Zalmoxis 24 hours following the antiviral \n\ntherapy discontinuation; patients characterized by conditions b) and c) could be administered Zalmoxis \n\nafter an adequate wash out period.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nZalmoxis 5-20 x 106 cells/mL cell dispersion for infusion contains 13.3 mmol (305.63 mg) of sodium \n\nper dose. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that, at the end of Zalmoxis infusion, the product label is removed from \n\nthe bag and placed in the patient record sheet. \n\n \n\nTreatment should be discontinued in case of occurrence of any 3-4 grade event related to Zalmoxis \n\nadministration or grade 2 adverse event not resolving in a grade 1 or less in the next 30 days. \n\n \n\nZalmoxis is obtained by donor blood cells. Even if donors are preliminary tested and found negative \n\nfor transmissible infectious disease, precautions should be employed when handling Zalmoxis. \n\nHealthcare professionals handling Zalmoxis should therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing \n\ngloves and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases. \n\n \n\nCases in which Zalmoxis cannot be supplied / infused \n\nIn some cases, the patient may be unable to receive Zalmoxis because of manufacturing issues.  \n\n \n\nThere may be cases in which the treating physician may still consider preferable to give the treatment \n\nor select an alternative treatment.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\nThe risk on virus shedding vertical viral transmission is theoretically negligible however not excluded.  \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 \n\ndays prior to start the treatment. Both male and female patients (to be) treated with Zalmoxis and their \n\npartners need to use effective contraception during and up to 6 months after treatment with Zalmoxis. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data from the use of Zalmoxis in pregnant women. \n\nStudies in animals have not been performed. Given the intended clinical use in the context of a \n\nhaploidentical bone marrow transplantation, a need for treatment during pregnancy is not expected. \n\nAs a precautionary measure, Zalmoxis must not be administered during pregnancy and in women of \n\nchildbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nIt has been shown that Zalmoxis cells may circulate for years after the last administration. In the event \n\nof pregnancy following Zalmoxis treatment adverse effect on pregnancy and the developing foetus are \n\nnot expected as lymphocytes do not pass the placenta. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nThere are no data on the use of Zalmoxis during breast-feeding. Immune cells are excreted in human \n\nmilk in low amounts. \n\nIt is recommended not to breast-feed during or after treatment with Zalmoxis therapy. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data on the effect of Zalmoxis treatment on fertility. However myeloablative \n\nconditioning regimens performed in the context of a haploidentical bone marrow transplantation is \n\nassociated with sterility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nZalmoxis has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNo detrimental effects on such activities are predicted from the pharmacology of the medicinal \n\nproduct. The clinical status of the patient and the ADR profile of Zalmoxis should be born in mind \n\nwhen considering the patient\u2019s ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive \n\nskills. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nIn the clinical study TK007, 30 patients with high-risk haematological malignancies undergoing \n\nHSCT received Zalmoxis monthly up to a maximum of four infusions. \n\nThe most common adverse reaction reported by patients treated with Zalmoxis in clinical trial TK007 \n\nwas acute GvHD.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nUndesirable effects recorded in the clinical study TK007 are listed in Table 1 by system organ class \n\nand by frequency of occurrence. \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Severity of acute GvHD was grade \n\n1 in one case (3%), grade 2 in seven (23%), grade 3 in one (3%) and grade 4 in one (3%). All acute \n\nGvHD events fully resolved after a median duration of 12 days. Only one patient (3%) developed an \n\nextensive chronic GvHD that occurred 159 days and 129 days from HSCT and last infusion, \n\nrespectively, and fully resolved after 107 days. There were no GvHD-related deaths or long-term \n\ncomplications. Both acute and chronic GvHD events developed only in patients who had achieved \n\nimmune reconstitution. \nFor treating Zalmoxis-related GvHD through activation of the suicide gene, patients received GCV \n\nintravenously or VCV orally, for better patient convenience. All signs and symptoms of grade 2 to 4 \n\nacute and extensive chronic GvHD fully resolved after a median treatment duration of GCV or VCV \n\nof 15 days. One patient with grade 1 acute GvHD did not receive any treatment. Seven patients needed \n\nto add an immunosuppressive treatment consisting of steroids, mycophenolate and/or cyclosporine. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nNo specific paediatric group has been studied at present. Only one 17-year-old male, affected by T \n\nlymphoblastic lymphoma, was treated in the TK007 trial with two infusions of Zalmoxis. No adverse \n\nreactions were reported for this patient. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\nIn the TK007 clinical study only one 66-year-old female was treated with one infusion of Zalmoxis. \n\nThe patient did not experience any adverse reactions. No implications on the use of Zalmoxis in \n\npatients of 65 and older have been established. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms of overdose are not known. In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for \n\nsigns or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: not yet assigned \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThe primary mechanism of action of Zalmoxis relies on its ability to engraft and stimulate immune-\n\nreconstitution.  \n\nZalmoxis is constituted of donor\u2019s T lymphocytes genetically modified to express the HSV-TK Mut2, \n\nas suicide gene. This allows the selective killing of dividing cells upon administration of the pro-drug \n\nGCV, which is enzymatically phosphorylated to an active triphosphate analogue by HSV-TK. \n\nTriphosphate GCV competitively, inhibits incorporation of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) into \n\nelongating DNA, thus killing the proliferating cells. \n\nIf GvHD occurs, GCV/VCV will be administered. The activated, transduced T lymphocytes that are \n\ncausing the GvHD should convert the GCV to its toxic form and thereby undergo apoptosis. This \n\nstrategy allows the direct targeting of those T lymphocytes that are initiating the GvHD response. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nOverall, in the clinical study TK007, the 30 treated patients received their first infusion of Zalmoxis \n\ncells at a median time of 43 days from the date of HSCT. The median interval time between the first and \n\nthe subsequent infusions of Zalmoxis cells was 30 days. \n\nImmune-reconstituted patients reached a CD3+ cell count \u2265 100/\u03bcL at a median of 77 days after HSCT.  \n\nIn particular, at immune reconstitution Zalmoxis represents a high proportion of the circulating \n\nlymphocytes, while at later time points the proportion of Zalmoxis progressively decreases and \n\nuntransduced lymphocytes expand from donor-derived precursors. One year post-Zalmoxis \n\nadministration the newly reconstituted T cell repertoire is dominated by untransduced cells of donor \n\norigin which displayed a polyclonal pattern comparable to healthy individuals.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nZalmoxis was evaluated in a phase I/II clinical study (TK007) in adult patients with haematological \n\nmalignancies at high risk of relapse who have received a stem-cell transplantation from a human \n\nleukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched (haploidentical) donor. High-risk haematological malignancies \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\ntreated with Zalmoxis included acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), secondary AML, acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. \n\nTreatment plan consisted of the administration of genetically modified donor\u2019s T lymphocytes \n\n(ranging from 1 x 106 to 1 x 107 cells/kg body weight). Primary aims of the TK007 study were to \n\nevaluate incidence and time to immune reconstitution, defined by the number of circulating CD3+ \u2265 \n\n100/\u03bcL for two consecutive observations, and incidence of GvHD and response to GCV. Criteria for \n\nreceiving Zalmoxis infusions included the lack of both immune reconstitution and GvHD. \n\n \n\nOf 30 patients receiving Zalmoxis, 23 patients (77%) obtained immune reconstitution, with a median \n\ntime of 31 days after the first infusion. For the patients who achieved immune reconstitution, a non-\n\nrelapse mortality (NRM) of 17% was reported, with 35% of these patients being disease free at 5 years \n\nand 34% alive at 10 years. \n\n \n\nResults from a matched-pair analyses that included 36 Zalmoxis patients (22 from TK007 trial and 14 \n\nfrom the ongoing phase III TK008 trial) and 127 control patients, showed that the Zalmoxis treated \n\npatients that had survived the first 3 weeks post-transplant without relapse benefited in terms of 1 year \n\noverall survival (OS) (40% vs 51% (p=0.03)) and 1-year NRM (42% vs 23% (p=0.04)). There was no \n\nsignificant difference regarding leukaemia free survival and the chance for relapse. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nZalmoxis in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the following condition: adjunctive \n\ntreatment in haematopoietic cell transplantation (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme. This \n\nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \n\nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe nature and the intended use of the product are such that conventional studies on pharmacokinetics \n\nincluding absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion are not applicable. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nConventional toxicology, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and reproductive toxicology studies have not \n\nbeen performed. \n\nNon clinical safety data obtained in two different immunedeficient animal models for GvHD did not \n\nindicate special hazards for humans, but allowed only a very limited safety assessment. In vitro \n\nevaluation of oncological potential indicate that the risk of malignant transformation is low.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Relevant information about the safety concerns of Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) \n\nDuring and after treatment with Zalmoxis the physician must be aware of acute and chronic sign and \n\nsymptoms of GvHD at any time and ensure that either ganciclovir or valganciclovir is available at \n\nward for early treatment of GvHD. \n\nIf at any time during or after treatment with Zalmoxis an acute GvHD of grade equal to or greater than \n\n2 or a chronic GvHD develop, the patient has to be treated with ganciclovir at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day \n\ndivided into 2 administrations intravenously, or valganciclovir 900 mg two times per day orally for 14 \n\ndays. \n\nIn case of GvHD progression after 3 days of treatment with ganciclovir or valganciclovir alone, a \n\nstandard immunosuppressive therapy has to be added. \n\nZalmoxis should be administered after a 24-hour discontinuation period of ganciclovir or \n\nvalganciclovir and immunosuppressive therapy. \n\n2.  Relevant information about the safety concern of Concomitant administration of \n\nGanciclovir and Valganciclovir \n\nThe treating physician must ensure that patients do not receive ganciclovir or valganciclovir within 24 \n\nhours prior to the administration of Zalmoxis. A longer interval might apply in case of renal failure.  \n\n3. Relevant information about the safety concern of Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy \n\nPatients should not be administered Zalmoxis in case of: \n\no Onset of GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy  \n\no Ongoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy or administration of granulocyte colony \n\nstimulating factor (G-CSF) after haploidentical hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation \n\nPatients could be treated with Zalmoxis 24 hours after the antiviral or immunosuppressive therapy \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nZalmoxis shall not be administered to patients with concurrent systemic immunosuppressive therapy \n\nas the efficacy of Zalmoxis treatment in early immune reconstitution may be reduced. \n\nImmunosuppressive therapy also affects immunocompetent cells as such infused with Zalmoxis.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT ZALMOXIS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nZalmoxis consists of white blood cells called T cells that are obtained from the donor. These cells will \n\nbe genetically modified by introducing a \u201csuicide\u201d gene (HSV-TK Mut2) in their genetic code which \n\ncan be activated later on in case of graft-versus-host disease. This will ensure that the cells can be \n\neliminated before they can cause damage to the patient\u2019s cells.  \n\n \n\nZalmoxis is intended for use in adults with certain tumours of the blood known as high-risk \n\nhaemotological malignancies. It is given after haploidentical bone marrow transplantation \n\n(haematopoietic cell transplantation). Haploidentical means that the cells have been obtained from a \n\ndonor whose tissues partially match the patient's tissue. Zalmoxis is given to prevent a complication of \n\ntransplantations that are not fully matched known as \u2018graft-versus-host disease\u2019 whereby the cells of \n\nthe donor attack the patient\u2019s own cells.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN ZALMOXIS \n\n \n\nDo not use Zalmoxis: \n\n \n\n- If you are allergic to the active substance or any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- If, before infusion, the value of CD3+ lymphocytes in your tests is equal to or more than 100 per \n\n\u03bcL. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n- If you suffer from graft-versus-host disease which requires the use of medicines to suppress \n\nyour immune system. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nZalmoxis is a patient specific product and should under no circumstances be administered to other \n\npatients. \n\nYour doctor will closely supervise the treatment therapy. You should tell your doctor before using \n\nZalmoxis if: \n\n \n\n- You suffer from infections requiring administration of ganciclovir (GCV) or valganciclovir \n\n(VCV) (antiviral) at the time of infusion. In this case treatment with Zalmoxis should be delayed \n\nuntil 24 hours after the end of the antiviral therapy. \n\n- You suffer from graft-versus-host disease which requires the use of medicines to suppress your \n\nimmune system. \n\n- If you are taking medicines to suppress your immune system or you are taking G-CSF (that \n\nstimulates the bone marrow to produce blood cells) after receiving stem-cell transplantation . In \n\nthis case, Zalmoxis may be administered after an adequate wash out period (the time necessary \n\nto remove a medicine from your body). \n\n- If you have previously experienced any adverse reaction following Zalmoxis administration and \n\nthis has not been resolved within 30 days after its occurrence. \n\n \n\nWhen Zalmoxis cannot be given \n\n \n\nIn some cases you may not be able to receive a scheduled infusion of Zalmoxis. This may be because \n\nof manufacturing issues. \n\n \n\nIn such cases your physician will be informed and may still consider preferable to give the treatment \n\nor may select an alternative treatment for you. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nCurrently, no data are available for these patients. The use of Zalmoxis is not recommended for \n\nchildren and adolescents under the age of 18. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Zalmoxis \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\nPlease inform your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nThe safe use of Zalmoxis has not been demonstrated during pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n\nZalmoxis must not be used in pregnant and breast-feeding women. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 6 months after \n\ntreatment with Zalmoxis. \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nZalmoxis should not have any effects on your ability to drive and use machines. However, you should \n\npay attention to your overall status when considering performing tasks that require judgment, motor or \n\ncognitive skills. \n\n \n\nZalmoxis contains sodium \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nZalmoxis 5-20 x 106 cells/mL cell dispersion for infusion contains 13.3 mmol (305.63 mg) of sodium \n\nper dose. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. HOW ZALMOXIS IS GIVEN TO YOU \n\n \n\nZalmoxis can only be prescribed and administered in a hospital by a doctor or a nurse who is trained in \n\nadministering this medicine. Practical information for handling and administration of Zalmoxis for the \n\ndoctor or nurse can be found at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nZalmoxis has been manufactured specifically for you and cannot be administered to any other patient. \n\nThe amount of cells to be administered depends on your body weight. The dose corresponds to 1 \u00b1 0.2 \n\nx 107 cells/kg.  \n\n \n\nZalmoxis is given intravenously (into a vein) as a drip infusion over approximately 20-60 minutes at a \n\ntime interval of 21-49 days from transplantation. Additional infusions are given once a month, for up \n\nto 4 months. The decision to proceed with the next treament is determined by your physician/doctor \n\nand is related to your immune status. \n\n \n\nIf you receive more Zalmoxis than you should \n\n \n\nAs this medicine is prescribed by a doctor, each dose is prepared for you only and each preparation \n\nconsists of a single dose. It is unlikely that you will be given too much.  \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Zalmoxis \n\n \n\nThis medicine is prescribed by a doctor and given in a hospital under strict survelliance and \n\npredetermined schedule so that you cannot forget your dose. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

The \n\ndecision to proceed with a new treatment depends on the immune reconstitution status of the patient \n\nachieved when a circulating T lymphocyte count is equal to or more than 100 per \u00b5L.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nHandling instructions \n\n \n\nBefore handling or administering Zalmoxis \n\n\u2022 Zalmoxis is shipped directly to the medical facility where the infusion will be administered. The \n\nshipping is performed in liquid nitrogen vapour. The bag is put in a second bag (intermediate \n\ncontainer) and this one is placed in an aluminium box (outer container). The whole package is \n\nsecured in a liquid nitrogen container designed to maintain the appropriate transportation and \n\nstorage temperature until the time of infusion. If the medicinal product is not immediately \n\nprepared for infusion, transfer the bag in liquid nitrogen vapour. Do not irradiate. \n\n\u2022 Zalmoxis is prepared from human blood of a specific donor and it consists of genetically \n\nmodified cells. Donors are tested for transmissible infectious agents in line with applicable local \n\nrequirements. However, the risk of transmitting infectious viruses to healthcare professionals \n\ncannot be totally excluded. Accordingly, healthcare professionals should take appropriate \n\nprecautions (e.g. wearing gloves and glasses) when handling Zalmoxis. \n\n\u2022 The outer and intermediate package should be checked to verify the product and patient-specific-\n\nlabel located on the top of the box and on the intermediate bag. \n\n \n\nWhat to check before infusion \n\n\u2022 Check that the Certificate of Analysis containing the patient identifiers, expiry date and approval \n\nfor infusion has been received from the Marketing Authorization Holder. \n\n\u2022 Check that the patient identity matches the essential and unique patient information reported on \n\nthe Zalmoxis bag and on the Certificate of Analysis. \n\n\u2022 Once the patient is prepared for infusion, inspect the Zalmoxis bag for integrity. The bag should \n\nappear as an opaque, off-white frozen cell dispersion. If the bag appears to have clear breaks or to \n\nbe non-intact, do not use the product. \n\n\u2022 Put the bag into two plastic envelopes (double envelopment) to avoid direct contact with water. \n\n\u2022 While holding the top of the envelope bag out of the water, put it in a 37\u00b11\u00b0C water bath being \n\ncareful not to allow water to penetrate the seal. If leakage occurs during thawing, do not use the \n\nproduct. \n\n \n\nAdministration \n\n\u2022 When completely thawed, remove the Zalmoxis bag out from the double envelopment, dry it off \n\nand disinfect the outside. \n\n\u2022 Proceed with the infusion as quickly as possible, avoiding keeping the bag in the water bath after \n\nthawing. \n\n\u2022 The entire volume of the bag must be infused. The recommended infusion time is around 20-60 \n\nminutes \n\n \n\nAfter the infusion \n\n\u2022 At the end of infusion, wash the bag 2 or 3 times with a physiological solution using a sterile \ntechnique, in order to completely administer Zalmoxis. \n\n\u2022 Upon completion of washing, the patient specific label on the bag should be removed and adhered \nto the patient specific file. \n\n\u2022 The cryobag and any unused product or waste material contains genetically modified organisms \nand should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\nDo not infuse Zalmoxis if \n\n\u2022 You have not received the Certificate of Analysis. \n\n\u2022 The Certificate of Analysis is marked as rejected. \n\n\u2022 The expiry date has passed. \n\n\u2022 The unique patient  information on the infusion bag does not match that of the scheduled patient. \n\n\u2022 The product integrity has been breached in anyway. \n \n\nShelf life and special precautions for storage \n\n\u2022 Zalmoxis has a shelf life of 18 months when stored in liquid nitrogen vapour. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Zalmoxis must be used be immediately after removal from the shipping container.

gene (hsv-tk mut2) in their genetic code which can be activated later on in case of graft-versus-host disease. this will ensure that the cells can be eliminated before they can cause damage to the patient's cells. zalmoxis is intended for use in adults with certain tumours of the blood known as high-risk haemotological malignancies. it is given after haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (haematopoietic cell transplantation). haploidentical means that the cells have been obtained from a donor whose tissues partially match the patient's tissue. zalmoxis is given to prevent a complication of transplantations that are not fully matched known as 'graft-versus-host disease' whereby the cells of the donor attack the patient's own cells.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

months. the decision to proceed with the next treament is determined by your physician/doctor and is related to your immune status. if you receive more zalmoxis than you should as this medicine is prescribed by a doctor, each dose is prepared for you only and each preparation consists of a single dose. it is unlikely that you will be given too much. if you forget to use zalmoxis this medicine
