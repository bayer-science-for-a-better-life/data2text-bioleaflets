NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nAclasta 5 mg solution for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach bottle with 100 ml of solution contains 5 mg zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). \n\n \n\nEach ml of the solution contains 0.05 mg zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for infusion \n\n \n\nClear and colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTreatment of osteoporosis \n\n in post-menopausal women \n\n in adult men \nat increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture. \n\n \n\nTreatment of osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy \n\n in post-menopausal women \n\n in adult men \nat increased risk of fracture. \n\n \n\nTreatment of Paget’s disease of the bone in adults. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nPatients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Aclasta. This is especially important \n\nfor the elderly (≥65 years)and for patients receiving diuretic therapy. \n\n \n\nAdequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration. \n\n \n\nOsteoporosis \n\nFor the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis, osteoporosis in men and the treatment of \n\nosteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy, the recommended dose is a \n\nsingle intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta administered once a year. \n\n \n\nThe optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis has not been established. The need \n\nfor continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically based on the benefits and potential risks of \n\nAclasta on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIn patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture, it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion at \n\nleast two weeks after hip fracture repair (see section 5.1). In patients with a recent low-trauma hip \n\nfracture, a loading dose of 50 000 to 125 000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular \n\nroute is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion. \n\n \n\nPaget’s disease \n\nFor the treatment of Paget’s disease, Aclasta should be prescribed only by physicians with experience \n\nin the treatment of Paget’s disease of the bone. The recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion \n\nof 5 mg Aclasta. In patients with Paget’s disease, it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental \n\ncalcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days \n\nfollowing Aclasta administration (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRe-treatment of Paget’s disease: After initial treatment with Aclasta in Paget’s disease, an extended \n\nremission period is observed in responding patients. Re-treatment consists of an additional intravenous \n\ninfusion of 5 mg Aclasta after an interval of one year or longer from initial treatment in patients who \n\nhave relapsed. Limited data on re-treatment of Paget’s disease are available (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nAclasta is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 35 ml/min. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly (≥ 65 years) \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability, distribution and elimination were similar in \n\nelderly patients and younger subjects. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAclasta should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. There are no data \n\navailable for children under 5 years of age. Currently available data for children aged 5 to 17 years are \n\ndescribed in section 5.1. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nIntravenous use. \n\nAclasta is administered via a vented infusion line and given slowly at a constant infusion rate. The \n\ninfusion time must not be less than 15 minutes. For information on the infusion of Aclasta, see \n\nsection 6.6. \n\n \n\nPatients treated with Aclasta should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients \nlisted in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n- Patients with hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). \n \n\n- Severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min (see section 4.4). \n \n\n- Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nRenal function \n\n \n\nThe use of Aclasta in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min) is \n\ncontraindicated due to an increased risk of renal failure in this population. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment has been observed following the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.8), \n\nespecially in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or other risks including advanced age, \n\nconcomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy (see section 4.5), or \n\ndehydration occurring after Aclasta administration. Renal impairment has been observed in patients \n\nafter a single administration. Renal failure requiring dialysis or with a fatal outcome has rarely \n\noccurred in patients with underlying renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described above. \n\n \n\nThe following precautions should be taken into account to minimise the risk of renal adverse \n\nreactions: \n\n Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using the \nCockcroft-Gault formula before each Aclasta dose. \n\n Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with underlying impaired renal \nfunction. \n\n Monitoring of serum creatinine should be considered in at-risk patients. \n\n Aclasta should be used with caution when concomitantly used with other medicinal products \nthat could impact renal function (see section 4.5). \n\n Patients, especially elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy, should be appropriately \nhydrated prior to administration of Aclasta. \n\n A single dose of Aclasta should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be at least \n15 minutes (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nHypocalcaemia \n\n \n\nPre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before \n\ninitiating therapy with Aclasta (see section 4.3). Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also \n\nbe effectively treated (e.g. diminished parathyroid reserve, intestinal calcium malabsorption). \n\nPhysicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients. \n\n \n\nElevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget’s disease of the bone. Due to the rapid onset of \n\neffect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover, transient hypocalcaemia, sometimes symptomatic, may \n\ndevelop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAdequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration. \n\nIn addition, in patients with Paget's disease, it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium \n\ncorresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days \n\nfollowing Aclasta administration (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nPatients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical \n\nmonitoring during the period of risk. Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Aclasta is \n\nrecommended for patients with Paget´s disease. \n\n \n\nSevere and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported \n\nin patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) \n\n \n\nONJ has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving Aclasta (zoledronic acid) for \n\nosteoporosis (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \n\nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth. A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual \n\nbenefit-risk assessment is recommended prior to treatment with Aclasta in patients with concomitant \n\nrisk factors. \n\n \n\nThe following should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ: \n\n- Potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent \n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative \n\ndose of bone resorption therapy. \n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n\n- Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck. \n\n- Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, \n\ninvasive dental procedures, e.g. tooth extractions. \n\n \n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \n\nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, non-healing of \n\nsores or discharge during treatment with zoledronic acid. While on treatment, invasive dental \n\nprocedures should be performed with caution and avoided in close proximity to zoledronic acid \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nThe management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between \n\nthe treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of \n\nzoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \n\nfactors are mitigated where possible. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \n\nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \n\ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \n\npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \n\nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n\n \n\nAtypical fractures of the femur \n\n \n\nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \n\ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \n\noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \n\nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \n\nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \n\nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \n\ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \n\nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \n\nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \n\npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n\n \n\nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \n\nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n\n \n\nAcute phase reactions \n\n \n\nAcute phase reactions (APRs) or post-dose symptoms such as fever, myalgia, flu-like symptoms, \n\narthralgia and headache have been observed, the majority of which occurred within three days \n\nfollowing Aclasta administration. \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nAPRs may sometimes be serious or prolonged in duration. The incidence of post-dose symptoms can \n\nbe reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta \n\nadministration. It is also advisable to postpone treatment if the patient is clinically unstable due to an \n\nacute medical condition and an APR could be problematic (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nOther products containing zoledronic acid as an active substance are available for oncology \n\nindications. Patients being treated with Aclasta should not be treated with such products or any other \n\nbisphosphonate concomitantly, since the combined effects of these agents are unknown. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 ml vial of Aclasta, i.e. \n\nessentially “sodium free”. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed. Zoledronic acid is not \n\nsystemically metabolised and does not affect human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro (see \n\nsection 5.2). Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 43-55% bound) \n\nand interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound medicinal products are therefore \n\nunlikely. \n\n \n\nZoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion. Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid is \n\nadministered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e.g. \n\naminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, the systemic exposure to concomitant medicinal products that are \n\nprimarily excreted via the kidney may increase. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nAclasta is not recommended in women of childbearing potential. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nAclasta is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). There are no adequate data on the use of \n\nzoledronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in animals with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive \n\ntoxicological effects including malformations (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nAclasta is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). It is unknown whether zoledronic \n\nacid is excreted into human milk. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nZoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 \n\ngeneration. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered related to the compound’s \n\ninhibition of skeletal calcium mobilisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a \n\nbisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded \n\ndetermining a definitive effect of Aclasta on fertility in humans. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nAdverse reactions, such as dizziness, may affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe overall percentage of patients who experienced adverse reactions were 44.7%, 16.7% and 10.2% \n\nafter the first, second and third infusion, respectively. Incidence of individual adverse reactions \n\nfollowing the first infusion was: pyrexia (17.1%), myalgia (7.8%), influenza-like illness (6.7%), \n\narthralgia (4.8%) and headache (5.1%), see “acute phase reactions” below. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \n\ncategory.

Frequency cannot be estimated from available data. \n\n† Identified in post-marketing experience. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAtrial fibrillation \n\nIn the HORIZON – Pivotal Fracture Trial [PFT] (see section 5.1), the overall incidence of atrial \n\nfibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in patients receiving Aclasta and \n\nplacebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in patients \n\nreceiving Aclasta (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared with patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 out of \n\n3,852). The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is unknown. In the \n\nosteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the pooled atrial fibrillation \n\nincidences were comparable between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%). For atrial fibrillation serious \n\nadverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3% for Aclasta and 0.8% for placebo. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nClass effects \n\nRenal impairment \n\nZoledronic acid has been associated with renal impairment manifested as deterioration in renal \n\nfunction (i.e. increased serum creatinine) and in rare cases acute renal failure. Renal impairment has \n\nbeen observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing \n\nrenal dysfunction or additional risk factors (e.g advanced age, oncology patients with chemotherapy, \n\nconcomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy, severe dehydration), with \n\nthe majority of them receiving a 4 mg dose every 3–4 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after \n\na single administration. \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, the change in creatinine clearance (measured annually prior to dosing) \n\nand the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the Aclasta and placebo \n\ntreatment groups over three years. There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed within \n\n10 days in 1.8% of Aclasta-treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients. \n\n \n\nHypocalcaemia \n\nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, approximately 0.2% of patients had notable declines of serum calcium \n\nlevels (less than 1.87 mmol/l) following Aclasta administration. No symptomatic cases of \n\nhypocalcaemia were observed. \n\n \n\nIn the Paget’s disease trials, symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1% of \n\npatients, in all of whom it resolved. \n\n \n\nBased on laboratory assessment, transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference \n\nrange (less than 2.10 mmol/l) occurred in 2.3% of Aclasta-treated patients in a large clinical trial \n\ncompared to 21% of Aclasta-treated patients in the Paget’s disease trials. The frequency of \n\nhypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions. \n\n \n\nAll patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal \n\nosteoporosis trial, the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial, and the Paget’s disease \n\ntrials (see also section 4.2). In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip \n\nfracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading \n\ndose of vitamin D prior to Aclasta administration (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nLocal reactions \n\nIn a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and/or pain, were \n\nreported (0.7%) following the administration of zoledronic acid. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \n\nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \n\nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). In a large \n\nclinical trial in 7,736 patients, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with \n\nAclasta and one patient treated with placebo. Cases of ONJ have been reported in the post-marketing \n\nsetting for Aclasta. \n\n \n\nAcute phase reactions \n\nThe overall percentage of patients who reported acute phase reactions or post-dose symptoms \n\n(including serious cases) after Aclasta administration is as follows (frequencies derived from the study \n\nin treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis): fever (18.1%), myalgia (9.4%), flu-like symptoms \n\n(7.8%), arthralgia (6.8%) and headache (6.5%), the majority of which occurred within the first 3 days \n\nfollowing Aclasta administration. The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate in nature \n\nand resolved within 3 days of the event onset. The incidence of these symptoms decreased with \n\nsubsequent annual doses of Aclasta. The percentage of patients who experienced adverse reactions \n\nwas lower in a smaller study (19.5%, 10.4%, 10.7% after the first, second and third infusion, \n\nrespectively), where prophylaxis against adverse reactions was used (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nClinical experience with acute overdose is limited. Patients who have received doses higher than those \n\nrecommended should be carefully monitored. In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant \n\nhypocalcaemia, reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/or an intravenous \n\ninfusion of calcium gluconate. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC code: \n\nM05BA08 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nZoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on \n\nbone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone. \n\n \n\nThe main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate \n\nsynthase. The long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity for \n\nthe active site of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase and its strong binding affinity to bone \n\nmineral. \n\n \n\nAclasta treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone turnover from elevated post-menopausal levels with \n\nthe nadir for resorption markers observed at 7 days, and for formation markers at 12 weeks. Thereafter \n\nbone markers stabilised within the pre-menopausal range. There was no progressive reduction of bone \n\nturnover markers with repeated annual dosing. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis (PFT) \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated in \n\npost-menopausal women (7,736 women aged 65–89 years) with either: a femoral neck bone mineral \n\ndensity (BMD) with a T-score ≤ –1.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing vertebral \n\nfracture(s); or a femoral neck BMD T-score ≤ –2.5 with or without evidence of existing vertebral \n\nfracture(s). 85% of patients were bisphosphonate-naïve. Women who were evaluated for the incidence \n\nof vertebral fractures did not receive concomitant osteoporosis therapy, which was allowed for women \n\ncontributing to the hip and all clinical fracture evaluations. Concomitant osteoporosis therapy \n\nincluded: calcitonin, raloxifene, tamoxifen, hormone replacement therapy, tibolone; but excluded other \n\nbisphosphonates. All women received 1,000 to 1,500 mg elemental calcium and 400 to 1,200 IU of \n\nvitamin D supplements daily. \n\n \n\nEffect on morphometric vertebral fractures \n\nAclasta significantly decreased the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures over three years \n\nand as early as the one year timepoint (see Table 2). \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nTable 2 Summary of vertebral fracture efficacy at 12, 24 and 36 months \n\n \n\nOutcome Aclasta \n\n(%) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(%) \n\nAbsolute reduction in \n\nfracture incidence % \n\n(CI) \n\nRelative reduction in \n\nfracture incidence % \n\n(CI) \n\nAt least one new vertebral \n\nfracture (0–1 year) \n\n1.5 3.7 2.2 (1.4, 3.1) 60 (43, 72)** \n\nAt least one new vertebral \n\nfracture (0–2 year) \n\n2.2 7.7 5.5 (4.4, 6.6) 71 (62, 78)** \n\nAt least one new vertebral \n\nfracture (0–3 year) \n\n3.3 10.9 7.6 (6.3, 9.0) 70 (62, 76)** \n\n** p <0.0001 \n\n \n\nAclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older exhibited a 60% reduction in the risk of vertebral \n\nfractures compared to placebo patients (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\nEffect on hip fractures \n\nAclasta demonstrated a consistent effect over 3 years, resulting in a 41% reduction in the risk of hip \n\nfractures (95% CI, 17% to 58%). The hip fracture event rate was 1.44% for Aclasta-treated patients \n\ncompared to 2.49% for placebo-treated patients. The risk reduction was 51% in bisphosphonate-naïve \n\npatients and 42% in patients allowed to take concomitant osteoporosis therapy. \n\n \n\nEffect on all clinical fractures \n\nAll clinical fractures were verified based on the radiographic and/or clinical evidence. A summary of \n\nresults is presented in Table 3. \n\n \n\nTable 3 Between treatment comparisons of the incidence of key clinical fracture variables \n\nover 3 years \n\n \n\nOutcome Aclasta \n\n(N=3,875) \n\nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N=3,861) \n\nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\nAbsolute \n\nreduction in \n\nfracture event rate \n\n% \n\n(CI) \n\nRelative risk \n\nreduction in \n\nfracture \n\nincidence % \n\n(CI) \n\nAny clinical fracture (1) 8.4 12.8 4.4 (3.0, 5.8) 33 (23, 42)** \n\nClinical vertebral fracture (2) 0.5 2.6 2.1 (1.5, 2.7) 77 (63, 86)** \n\n Non-vertebral fracture (1) 8.0 10.7 2.7 (1.4, 4.0) 25 (13, 36)* \n\n*p-value <0.001, **p-value <0.0001 \n\n(1) Excluding finger, toe and facial fractures \n\n(2) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures \n\n \n\nEffect on bone mineral density (BMD) \n\nAclasta significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, hip, and distal radius relative to treatment \n\nwith placebo at all timepoints (6, 12, 24 and 36 months). Treatment with Aclasta resulted in a 6.7% \n\nincrease in BMD at the lumbar spine, 6.0% at the total hip, 5.1% at the femoral neck, and 3.2% at the \n\ndistal radius over 3 years as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nBone histology \n\nBone biopsies were obtained from the iliac crest 1 year after the third annual dose in \n\n152 post-menopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with Aclasta (N=82) or placebo (N=70). \n\nHistomorphometric analysis showed a 63% reduction in bone turnover. In patients treated with \n\nAclasta, no osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis or woven bone formation was detected. Tetracycline label \n\nwas detectable in all but one of 82 biopsies obtained from patients on Aclasta. Microcomputed \n\ntomography (μCT) analysis demonstrated increased trabecular bone volume and preservation of \n\ntrabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta compared to placebo. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nBone turnover markers \n\nBone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) \n\nand serum beta-C-telopeptides (b-CTx) were evaluated in subsets ranging from 517 to 1,246 patients \n\nat periodic intervals throughout the study. Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of Aclasta significantly \n\nreduced BSAP by 30% relative to baseline at 12 months which was sustained at 28% below baseline \n\nlevels at 36 months. P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline levels at 12 months and \n\nwas sustained at 52% below baseline levels at 36 months. B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% \n\nbelow baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 55% below baseline levels at 36 months. \n\nDuring this entire time period bone turnover markers were within the pre-menopausal range at the end \n\nof each year. Repeat dosing did not lead to further reduction of bone turnover markers. \n\n \n\nEffect on height \n\nIn the three-year osteoporosis study standing height was measured annually using a stadiometer. The \n\nAclasta group revealed approximately 2.5 mm less height loss compared to placebo (95% CI: 1.6 mm, \n\n3.5 mm) [p<0.0001]. \n\n \n\nDays of disability \n\nAclasta significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to back \n\npain by 17.9 days and 11.3 days respectively compared to placebo and significantly reduced the mean \n\ndays of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to fractures by 2.9 days and 0.5 days respectively \n\ncompared to placebo (all p<0.01). \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at increased risk of fracture after a recent \n\nhip fracture (RFT) \n\n \n\nThe incidence of clinical fractures, including vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fractures, was evaluated \n\nin 2,127 men and women aged 50-95 years (mean age 74.5 years) with a recent (within 90 days) \n\nlow-trauma hip fracture who were followed for an average of 2 years on study treatment (Aclasta). \n\nApproximately 42% of patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score below -2.5 and approximately 45% \n\nof the patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score above -2.5. Aclasta was administered once a year, \n\nuntil at least 211 patients in the study population had confirmed clinical fractures. Vitamin D levels \n\nwere not routinely measured but a loading dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 IU orally or by \n\nintramuscular route) was given to the majority of patients 2 weeks prior to infusion. All participants \n\nreceived 1,000 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium plus 800 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplementation \n\nper day. Ninety-five percent of the patients received their infusion two or more weeks after the hip \n\nfracture repair and the median timing of infusion was approximately six weeks after the hip fracture \n\nrepair. The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of clinical fractures over the duration of the \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\nEffect on all clinical fractures \n\nThe incidence rates of key clinical fracture variables are presented in Table 4. \n\n \n\nTable 4 Between treatment comparisons of the incidence of key clinical fracture variables \n\n \n\nOutcome Aclasta \n\n(N=1,065) \n\nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N=1,062) \n\nevent rate \n\n(%) \n\nAbsolute \n\nreduction in \n\nfracture event \n\nrate % \n\n(CI) \n\nRelative risk \n\nreduction in \n\nfracture incidence \n\n% (CI) \n\nAny clinical fracture (1) 8.6 13.9 5.3 (2.3, 8.3) 35 (16, 50)** \n\nClinical vertebral fracture (2) 1.7 3.8 2.1 (0.5, 3.7) 46 (8, 68)* \n\nNon-vertebral fracture (1) 7.6 10.7 3.1 (0.3, 5.9) 27 (2, 45)* \n\n*p-value <0.05, **p-value <0.01 \n\n(1) Excluding finger, toe and facial fractures \n\n(2) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\nThe study was not designed to measure significant differences in hip fracture, but a trend was seen \n\ntowards reduction in new hip fractures. \n\n \n\nAll cause mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the Aclasta-treated group compared to 13% \n\n(141 patients) in the placebo group. This corresponds to a 28% reduction in the risk of all cause \n\nmortality (p=0.01). \n\n \n\nThe incidence of delayed hip fracture healing was comparable between Aclasta (34 [3.2%]) and \n\nplacebo (29 [2.7%]). \n\n \n\nEffect on bone mineral density (BMD) \n\nIn the HORIZON-RFT study Aclasta treatment significantly increased BMD at the total hip and \n\nfemoral neck relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints. Treatment with Aclasta resulted in an \n\nincrease in BMD of 5.4% at the total hip and 4.3% at the femoral neck over 24 months as compared to \n\nplacebo. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy in men \n\n \n\nIn the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised into the study and 185 patients had BMD \n\nassessed at 24 months. At 24 months a similar significant increase of 3.6% in total hip BMD was \n\nobserved for patients treated with Aclasta as compared to the effects observed in post-menopausal \n\nwomen in the HORIZON-PFT study. The study was not powered to show a reduction in clinical \n\nfractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated with Aclasta versus 8.7% \n\nfor placebo. \n\n \n\nIn another study in men (study CZOL446M2308) an annual infusion of Aclasta was non-inferior to \n\nweekly alendronate for the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 24 relative to baseline. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy in osteoporosis associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Aclasta in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis associated with \n\nlong-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy were assessed in a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, \n\nstratified, active-controlled study of 833 men and women aged 18-85 years (mean age for men \n\n56.4 years; for women 53.5 years) treated with > 7.5 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent). Patients \n\nwere stratified with respect to duration of glucocorticoid use prior to randomisation (≤ 3 months \n\nversus > 3 months). The duration of the trial was one year. Patients were randomised to either Aclasta \n\n5 mg single infusion or to oral risedronate 5 mg daily for one year. All participants received 1,000 mg \n\nelemental calcium plus 400 to 1,000 IU vitamin D supplementation per day. Efficacy was \n\ndemonstrated if non-inferiority to risedronate was shown sequentially with respect to the percentage \n\nchange in lumbar spine BMD at 12 months relative to baseline in the treatment and prevention \n\nsubpopulations, respectively. The majority of patients continued to receive glucocorticoids for the one \n\nyear duration of the trial. \n\n \n\nEffect on bone mineral density (BMD) \n\nThe increases in BMD were significantly greater in the Aclasta-treated group at the lumbar spine and \n\nfemoral neck at 12 months compared to risedronate (all p<0.03). In the subpopulation of patients \n\nreceiving glucocorticoids for more than 3 months prior to randomisation, Aclasta increased lumbar \n\nspine BMD by 4.06% versus 2.71% for risedronate (mean difference: 1.36% ; p<0.001). In the \n\nsubpopulation of patients that had received glucocorticoids for 3 months or less prior to \n\nrandomisation, Aclasta increased lumbar spine BMD by 2.60% versus 0.64% for risedronate (mean \n\ndifference: 1.96% ; p<0.001). The study was not powered to show a reduction in clinical fractures \n\ncompared to risedronate. The incidence of fractures was 8 for Aclasta-treated patients versus 7 for \n\nrisedronate-treated patients (p=0.8055). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n14 \n\nClinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget’s disease of the bone \n\n \n\nAclasta was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to moderate \n\nPaget’s disease of the bone (median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6–3.0 times the upper limit of \n\nthe age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry) confirmed by radiographic \n\nevidence. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for \n\n2 months was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials. After 6 months, Aclasta showed 96% \n\n(169/176) and 89% (156/176) response and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) normalisation rates \n\ncompared to 74% (127/171) and 58% (99/171) for risedronate (all p<0.001). \n\n \n\nIn the pooled results, a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to \n\nbaseline were observed over 6 months for Aclasta and risedronate. \n\n \n\nPatients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter \n\nan extended follow-up period. Of the 153 Aclasta-treated patients and 115 risedronate-treated patients \n\nwho entered an extended observation study, after a mean duration of follow-up of 3.8 years from time \n\nof dosing, the proportion of patients ending the Extended Observation Period due to the need for \n\nre-treatment (clinical judgment) was higher for risedronate (48 patients, or 41.7%) compared with \n\nzoledronic acid (11 patients, or 7.2%). The mean time of ending the Extended Observation Period due \n\nto the need for Paget’s re-treatment from the initial dose was longer for zoledronic acid (7.7 years) \n\nthan for risedronate (5.1 years). \n\n \n\nSix patients who achieved therapeutic response 6 months after treatment with Aclasta and later \n\nexperienced disease relapse during the extended follow-up period were re-treated with Aclasta after a \n\nmean time of 6.5 years from initial treatment to re-treatment. Five of the 6 patients had SAP within the \n\nnormal range at month 6 (Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF). \n\n \n\nBone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget’s disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg \n\nzoledronic acid. Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired \n\nbone remodelling and no evidence of mineralisation defects. These results were consistent with \n\nbiochemical marker evidence of normalisation of bone turnover. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in paediatric patients aged 5 to \n\n17 years treated with glucocorticoids who had decreased bone mineral density (lumbar spine BMD Z-\n\nscore of -0.5 or less) and a low impact/fragility fracture. The patient population randomised in this \n\nstudy (ITT population) included patients with several sub-types of rheumatic conditions, inflammatory \n\nbowel disease, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The study was planned to include 92 patients, \n\nhowever only 34 patients were enrolled and randomised to receive either a twice-yearly 0.05 mg/kg \n\n(max. 5 mg) intravenous zoledronic acid infusion or placebo for one year. All patients were required to \n\nreceive background therapy of vitamin D and calcium. \n\n \n\nZoledronic acid infusion resulted in an increase in the lumbar spine BMD Z-score least square (LS) \n\nmean difference of 0.41 at month 12 relative to baseline compared to placebo (95% CI: 0.02, 0.81; \n\n18 and 16 patients, respectively). No effect on lumbar spine BMD Z-score was evident after 6 months \n\nof treatment. At month 12, a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in three bone turnover markers \n\n(P1NP, BSAP, NTX) was observed in the zoledronic acid group as compared to the placebo group. No \n\nstatistically significant differences in total body bone mineral content were observed between patients \n\ntreated with zoledronic acid versus placebo at 6 or 12 months. There is no clear evidence establishing \n\na link between BMD changes and fracture prevention in children with growing skeletons. \n\n \n\nNo new vertebral fractures were observed in the zoledronic acid group as compared to two new \n\nfractures in the placebo group. \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions after infusion of zoledronic acid were arthralgia \n\n(28%), pyrexia (22%), vomiting (22%), headache (22%), nausea (17%), myalgia (17%), pain (17%), \n\ndiarrhoea (11%) and hypocalcaemia (11%). \n\n \n\nMore patients reported serious adverse events in the zoledronic acid group than in the placebo group \n\n(5 [27.8%] patients versus 1 [6.3%] patient). \n\n \n\nIn the 12-month open-label extension of the above-mentioned core study, no new clinical fractures \n\nwere observed. However 2 patients, one in each of the core study treatment groups (zoledronic acid \n\ngroup: 1/9, 11.1% and placebo group: 1/14, 7.1%), had new morphometric vertebral fractures. There \n\nwere no new safety findings. \n\n \n\nLong-term safety data in this population cannot be established from these studies. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nAclasta in all subsets of the paediatric population in Paget’s disease of the bone, osteoporosis in \n\npost-menopausal women at an increased risk of fracture, osteoporosis in men at increased risk of \n\nfracture and prevention of clinical fractures after a hip fracture in men and women (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nSingle and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients \n\nyielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose independent. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nAfter initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased \n\nrapidly, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% of \n\npeak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low \n\nconcentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak levels. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nIntravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic \n\ndisappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½ 0.24 and t½ 1.87 hours, followed by \n\na long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½ 146 hours. There was no \n\naccumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. The early \n\ndisposition phases (α and β, with t½ values above) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and \n\nexcretion via the kidneys. \n\n \n\nZoledronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, \n\n39 ± 16% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound \n\nto bone tissue. This uptake into bone is common for all bisphosphonates and is presumably a \n\nconsequence of the structural analogy to pyrophosphate. As with other bisphosphonates, the retention \n\ntime of zoledronic acid in bones is very long. From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into \n\nthe systemic circulation and eliminated via the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/h, \n\nindependent of dose, and unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight. The inter- and intra-subject \n\nvariation for plasma clearance of zoledronic acid was shown to be 36% and 34%, respectively. \n\nIncreasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease in zoledronic acid \n\nconcentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration \n\nversus time curve. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed with zoledronic acid. Since \n\nzoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity \n\nas a direct-acting and/or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes, zoledronic \n\nacid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the \n\ncytochrome P450 enzyme systems. Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins \n\n(approximately 43-55% bound) and binding is concentration independent. Therefore, interactions \n\nresulting from displacement of highly protein-bound medicinal products are unlikely. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations (see section 4.2) \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance \n\nrepresenting 75  33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84  29 ml/min (range 22 \n\nto 143 ml/min) in the 64 patients studied. Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr), by about 30% to \n\n40% in mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to a patient with normal renal function, and lack \n\nof accumulation of drug with multiple doses irrespective of renal function, suggest that dose \n\nadjustments of zoledronic acid in mild (Clcr = 50–80 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment down to \n\na creatinine clearance of 35 ml/min are not necessary. The use of Aclasta in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min) is contraindicated due to an increased risk of renal \n\nfailure in this population. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nAcute toxicity \n\n \n\nThe highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in \n\nrats. In the single-dose dog infusion studies, 1.0 mg/kg (6 fold the recommended human therapeutic \n\nexposure based on AUC) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects. \n\n \n\nSubchronic and chronic toxicity \n\n \n\nIn the intravenous infusion studies, renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when \n\ngiven 0.6 mg/kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals, six times in total (for a cumulative dose that \n\ncorresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure) while five 15-minute \n\ninfusions of 0.25 mg/kg administered at 2–3-week intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponded to \n\n7 times the human therapeutic exposure) were well tolerated in dogs. In the intravenous bolus studies, \n\nthe doses that were well-tolerated decreased with increasing study duration: 0.2 and 0.02 mg/kg daily \n\nwas well tolerated for 4 weeks in rats and dogs, respectively but only 0.01 mg/kg and 0.005 mg/kg in \n\nrats and dogs, respectively, when given for 52 weeks. \n\n \n\nLonger-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum \n\nintended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal \n\ntract and liver, and at the site of intravenous administration. The clinical relevance of these findings is \n\nunknown. The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary \n\nspongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that \n\nreflected the compound’s pharmacological antiresorptive activity. \n\n \n\nReproduction toxicity \n\n \n\nTeratology studies were performed in two species, both via subcutaneous administration. \n\nTeratogenicity was observed in rats at doses ≥ 0.2 mg/kg and was manifested by external, visceral and \n\nskeletal malformations. Dystocia was observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg body weight) tested in \n\nrats. No teratological or embryo/foetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was \n\nmarked at 0.1 mg/kg due to decreased serum calcium levels. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenic potential \n\n \n\nZoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did \n\nnot provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Aclasta is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nAclasta contains the active substance zoledronic acid. It belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nbisphosphonates and is used to treat post-menopausal women and adult men with osteoporosis or \n\nosteoporosis caused by treatment with corticosteroids used to treat inflammation, and Paget’s disease \n\nof the bone in adults. \n\n \n\nOsteoporosis \n\nOsteoporosis is a disease that involves the thinning and weakening of the bones and is common in \n\nwomen after the menopause, but can also occur in men. At the menopause, a woman’s ovaries stop \n\nproducing the female hormone oestrogen, which helps keep bones healthy. Following the menopause \n\nbone loss occurs, bones become weaker and break more easily. Osteoporosis could also occur in men \n\nand women because of the long term use of steroids, which can affect the strength of bones. Many \n\npatients with osteoporosis have no symptoms but they are still at risk of breaking bones because \n\nosteoporosis has made their bones weaker. Decreased circulating levels of sex hormones, mainly \n\noestrogens converted from androgens, also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men. \n\nIn both women and men, Aclasta strengthens the bone and therefore makes it less likely to break. \n\nAclasta is also used in patients who have recently broken their hip in a minor trauma such as a fall and \n\ntherefore are at risk of subsequent bone breaks. \n\n \n\nPaget’s disease of the bone \n\nIt is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material. This process is called \n\nremodelling. In Paget’s disease, bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered \n\nfashion, which makes it weaker than normal. If the disease is not treated, bones may become deformed \n\nand painful, and may break. Aclasta works by returning the bone remodelling process to normal, \n\nsecuring formation of normal bone, thus restoring strength to the bone. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Aclasta \n\n \n\nFollow all instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse carefully before you are given \n\nAclasta. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n34 \n\nYou must not be given Aclasta: \n\n- if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients of \nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- if you have hypocalcaemia (this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low). \n- if you have severe kidney problems. \n- if you are pregnant. \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before you are given Aclasta: \n\n- if you are being treated with any medicine containing zoledronic acid, which is also the active \n\nsubstance of Aclasta (zoledronic acid is used in adult patients with certain types of cancer to \n\nprevent bone complications or to reduce the amount of calcium). \n\n- if you have a kidney problem, or used to have one. \n- if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements. \n- if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed. \n- if you have had sections of your intestine removed. \n \n\nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported in the \n\npost-marketing setting in patients receiving Aclasta (zoledronic acid) for osteoporosis. ONJ can also \n\noccur after stopping treatment. \n\n \n\nIt is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to \n\ntreat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions \n\nyou should take. \n\n \n\nBefore receiving Aclasta treatment, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if \n\n- you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \nplanned tooth extraction; \n\n- you do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; \n- you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); \n- you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \n\ndisorders); \n\n- you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) \n- you have cancer. \n \n\nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with Aclasta. \n\n \n\nWhile being treated with Aclasta, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth \n\nbrushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit \n\nproperly. If you are under dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth \n\nextractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being \n\ntreated with Aclasta. Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems \n\nwith your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as \n\nthese could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n\n \n\nMonitoring test \n\nYour doctor should do a blood test to check your kidney function (levels of creatinine) before each \n\ndose of Aclasta. It is important for you to drink at least 2 glasses of fluid (such as water), within a few \n\nhours before receiving Aclasta, as directed by your healthcare provider. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nAclasta is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n\nOther medicines and Aclasta \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nIt is important for your doctor to know all the medicines you are taking, especially if you are taking \n\nany medicines known to be harmful to your kidneys (e.g. aminoglycosides) or diuretics (“waterpills”) \n\nthat may cause dehydration. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou must not be given Aclasta if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are \n\nplanning to have a baby. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nIf you feel dizzy while taking Aclasta, do not drive or use machines until you feel better. \n\n \n\nAclasta contains sodium \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 ml vial of Aclasta, i.e., \n\nessentially “sodium free”. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Aclasta is given \n \n\nFollow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse. Check with your doctor or nurse \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nOsteoporosis \nThe usual dose is 5 mg given as one infusion per year into a vein by your doctor or nurse. The infusion \n\nwill take at least 15 minutes. \n\n \n\nIn case you recently broke your hip, it is recommended that Aclasta is administered two or more \n\nweeks after your hip repair surgery. \n\n \n\nIt is important to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (for example tablets) as directed by your \n\ndoctor. \n\n \n\nFor osteoporosis, Aclasta works for one year. Your doctor will let you know when to return for your \n\nnext dose. \n\n \n\nPaget’s disease \n\nFor the treatment of Paget’s disease, Aclasta should be prescribed only by physicians with experience \n\nin the treatment of Paget’s disease of the bone. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose is 5 mg, given to you as one initial infusion into a vein by your doctor or nurse. The \n\ninfusion will take at least 15 minutes. Aclasta may work for longer than one year, and your doctor will \n\nlet you know if you need to be treated again. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (e.g. tablets) for at least the \n\nfirst ten days after being given Aclasta. It is important that you follow this advice carefully so that the \n\nlevel of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after the infusion. Your doctor \n\nwill inform you regarding the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n36 \n\nAclasta with food and drink \n\nMake sure you drink enough fluids (at least one or two glasses) before and after the treatment with \n\nAclasta, as directed by your doctor. This will help to prevent dehydration. You may eat normally on \n\nthe day you are treated with Aclasta. This is especially important in patients who take diuretics (“water \n\npills”) and in elderly patients (age 65 years or over). \n\n \n\nIf you missed a dose of Aclasta \n\nContact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment. \n\n \n\nBefore stopping Aclasta therapy \n\nIf you are considering stopping Aclasta treatment, please go to your next appointment and discuss this \n\nwith your doctor. Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with \n\nAclasta. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSide effects related to the first infusion are very common (occurring in more than 30% of patients) but \n\nare less common following subsequent infusions. The majority of the side effects, such as fever and \n\nchills, pain in the muscles or joints, and headache, occur within the first three days following the dose \n\nof Aclasta. The symptoms are usually mild to moderate and go away within three days. Your doctor \n\ncan recommend a mild pain reliever such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to reduce these side effects. The \n\nchance of experiencing these side effects decreases with subsequent doses of Aclasta. \n\n \n\nSome side effects could be serious \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\nIrregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving Aclasta for the treatment \n\nof postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heart \n\nrhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have \n\nreceived Aclasta. \n\n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\nSwelling, redness, pain and itching to the eyes or eye sensitivity to light. \n\n \n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n\nTalk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These could \n\nbe signs of bone damage in the ear. \n\n \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\nPain in the mouth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores in the mouth or jaw, discharge, numbness \n\nor a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth; these could be signs of bone damage in the \n\njaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience such symptoms while \n\nbeing treated with Aclasta or after stopping treatment. \n\n \n\nKidney disorders (e.g. decreased urine output) may occur. Your doctor should do a blood test to check \n\nyour kidney function before each dose of Aclasta. It is important for you to drink at least 2 glasses of \n\nfluid (such as water), within a few hours before receiving Aclasta, as directed by your healthcare \n\nprovider. \n\n \n\nIf you experience any of the above side effects, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nAclasta may also cause other side effects \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\nFever \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\nHeadache, dizziness, sickness, vomiting, diarrhoea, pain in the muscles, pain in the bones and/or \n\njoints, pain in the back, arms or legs, flu-like symptoms (e.g. tiredness, chills, joint and muscle pain), \n\nchills, feeling of tiredness and lack of interest, weakness, pain, feeling unwell, swelling and/or pain at \n\nthe infusion site. \n\n \n\nIn patients with Paget’s disease, symptoms due to low blood calcium, such as muscle spasms, or \n\nnumbness, or a tingling sensation especially in the area around the mouth have been reported. \n\n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\nFlu, upper respiratory tract infections, decreased red cell count, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, \n\nsleepiness which may include reduced alertness and awareness, tingling sensation or numbness, \n\nextreme tiredness, trembling, temporary loss of consciousness, eye infection or irritation or \n\ninflammation with pain and redness, spinning sensation, increased blood pressure, flushing, cough, \n\nshortness of breath, upset stomach, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, heartburn, skin rash, \n\nexcessive sweating, itching, skin reddening, neck pain, stiffness in muscles, bones and/or joints, joint \n\nswelling, muscle spasms, shoulder pain, pain in your chest muscles and rib cage, joint inflammation, \n\nmuscular weakness, abnormal kidney test results, abnormal frequent urination, swelling of hands, \n\nankles or feet, thirst, toothache, taste disturbances. \n\n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\nUnusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for osteoporosis may \n\noccur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or discomfort in your thigh, hip or \n\ngroin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of the thigh bone. Low levels of \n\nphosphate in the blood. \n\n \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\nSevere allergic reactions including dizziness and difficulty breathing, swelling mainly of the face and \n\nthroat, decreased blood pressure, dehydration secondary to acute phase reactions (post-dose symptoms \n\nsuch as fever, vomiting and diarrhoea). \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
