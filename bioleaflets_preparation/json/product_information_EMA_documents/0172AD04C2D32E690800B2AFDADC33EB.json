PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection).  \nThe solution is clear and colourless to slightly yellowish. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult patients \n(see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration. \n \nTreatment with MIRCERA has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of patients with renal impairment. \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult chronic kidney disease patients \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician’s evaluation of the individual patient’s clinical course and condition is necessary. \nMIRCERA should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase \nhaemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who \nare not receiving haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.21 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.45 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l) are observed are described below. \n \nA rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dl (1.24 mmol/l) over a four-week period should be avoided. \nIf it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided. \n\nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved effective dose of MIRCERA \nis used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia whilst maintaining a haemoglobin \nconcentration below or at 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l).  \n\nCaution should be exercised with escalation of MIRCERA doses in patients with chronic renal failure. \nIn patients with a poor haemoglobin response to MIRCERA, alternative explanations for the poor \nresponse should be considered (see section 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nIt is recommended that haemoglobin is monitored every two weeks until stabilized and periodically \nthereafter. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPatients not currently treated with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA): \nIn order to increase haemoglobin levels to greater than 10 g/dl (6.21 mmol/l), the recommended \nstarting dose in patients not on dialysis is 1.2 microgram/kg body weight, administered once every \nmonth as a single subcutaneous injection. \n \nAlternatively, a starting dose of 0.6 microgram/kg bodyweight may be administered once every two \nweeks as a single intravenous or subcutaneous injection in patients on dialysis or not on dialysis. \n \nThe dose may be increased by approximately 25% of the previous dose if the rate of rise in \nhaemoglobin is less than 1.0 g/dl (0.621 mmol/l) over a month. Further increases of approximately \n25% may be made at monthly intervals until the individual target haemoglobin level is obtained. \n \nIf the rate of rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.24 mmol/l) in one month or if the \nhaemoglobin level is increasing and approaching 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l), the dose is to be reduced by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin level continues to increase, therapy should be interrupted until \nthe haemoglobin level begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be restarted at a dose \napproximately 25% below the previously administered dose. After dose interruption a haemoglobin \ndecrease of approximately 0.35 g/dl (0.22 mmol/l) per week is expected. Dose adjustments should not \nbe made more frequently than once a month. \n \nPatients treated once every two weeks whose haemoglobin concentration is above 10 g/dl \n(6.21 mmol/l) may receive MIRCERA administered once-monthly using the dose equal to twice the \nprevious once-every-two-week dose. \n \nPatients currently treated with an ESA: \nPatients currently treated with an ESA can be switched to MIRCERA administered once a month as a \nsingle intravenous or subcutaneous injection. The starting dose of MIRCERA is based on the \ncalculated previous weekly dose of darbepoetin alfa or epoetin at the time of substitution as described \nin Table 1. The first injection should start at the next scheduled dose of the previously administered \ndarbepoetin alfa or epoetin. \n \nTable 1: MIRCERA starting doses \n\nPrevious weekly \ndarbepoetin alfa \nintravenous or \n\nsubcutaneous dose \n(microgram/week) \n\nPrevious weekly \nepoetin \n\nintravenous or \nsubcutaneous \n\ndose (IU/week) \n\nMonthly MIRCERA \nintravenous or \n\nsubcutaneous dose \n(microgram/once \n\nmonthly)  \n<40 <8000 120 \n\n40-80 8000-16000 200 \n>80 >16000 360 \n\n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain the target haemoglobin concentration above 10 g/dl \n(6.21 mmol/l), the monthly dose may be increased by approximately 25%. \n \nIf the rate of rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.24 mmol/l) over a month or if the \nhaemoglobin level is increasing and approaching 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l), the dose is to be reduced by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin level continues to increase, therapy should be interrupted until \nthe haemoglobin level begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be restarted at a dose \napproximately 25% below the previously administered dose. After dose interruption a haemoglobin \ndecrease of approximately 0.35 g/dl (0.22 mmol/l) per week is expected. Dose adjustments should not \nbe made more frequently than once a month. \n \nSince the treatment experience is limited in patients on peritoneal dialysis, regular haemoglobin \nmonitoring and strict adherence to dose adjustment guidance are recommended in these patients. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nTreatment interruption  \nTreatment with MIRCERA is normally long-term. However, it can be interrupted at any time, if \nnecessary. \n \nMissed dose \nIf one dose of MIRCERA is missed, the missed dose is to be administered as soon as possible and \nadministration of MIRCERA is to be restarted at the prescribed dosing frequency. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo adjustments of the starting dose nor of the dose modification rules are required in patients with \nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly population \nIn clinical studies 24% of patients treated with MIRCERA were aged 65 to 74 years, while 20% were \naged 75 years and over. No dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years or older. \n \nPaediatric population \nMIRCERA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of \nsafety and efficacy data. \n \nMethod of administration \nMIRCERA should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously. It can be injected \nsubcutaneously in the abdomen, arm or thigh. All three injection sites are equally suitable. For \ninstructions on the administration of the medicinal product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nUncontrolled hypertension. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe safety and efficacy of MIRCERA therapy in other indications, including anaemia in patients with \ncancer, has not been established. \n\nCaution should be exercised with escalation of MIRCERA doses in patients with chronic renal failure \nsince high cumulative epoetin doses may be associated with an increased risk of mortality, serious \ncardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. In patients with a poor haemoglobin response to epoetins, \nalternative explanations for the poor response should be considered (see section 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below \n100 microgram/l or with transferrin saturation below 20%. To ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron \nstatus has to be evaluated for all patients prior to and during treatment.  \n \nFailure to respond to MIRCERA therapy should prompt for a search for causative factors. Deficiencies \nof iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of ESAs and should therefore be corrected. \nIntercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, haemolysis, severe \naluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis may also compromise \nthe erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of the evaluation. If all \nthe conditions mentioned are excluded and the patient has a sudden drop of haemoglobin associated \nwith reticulocytopenia and anti-erythropoietin antibodies, examination of the bone marrow for the \ndiagnosis of Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) should be considered. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy \nwith MIRCERA must be discontinued and patients should not be switched to another ESA. \n \nPhysicians may request the Marketing Authorisation Holder to test or re-test serum samples in a \nreference laboratory for cases of suspected or confirmed AEAB-mediated PRCA or unexplained loss \n\n\n\n6 \n\nof effect under MIRCERA treatment (e.g. observed clinically by severe anaemia and low reticulocyte \ncount). \n \nPure Red Cell Aplasia caused by anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in association with \nall ESAs, including MIRCERA. These antibodies have been shown to cross-react with all ESAs, and \npatients suspected or confirmed to have antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to \nMIRCERA (see section 4.8). \n \nPRCA in patients with Hepatitis C: A paradoxical decrease in haemoglobin and development of severe \nanaemia associated with low reticulocyte counts should prompt to discontinue treatment with epoetin \nand perform anti-erythropoietin antibody testing. Cases have been reported in patients with hepatitis C \ntreated with interferon and ribavirin, when epoetins are used concomitantly. Epoetins are not approved \nin the management of anaemia associated with hepatitis C. \n \nBlood pressure monitoring: As with other ESAs, blood pressure may rise during treatment with \nMIRCERA. Blood pressure should be adequately controlled in all patients before, at initiation of, and \nduring treatment with MIRCERA. If high blood pressure is difficult to control by medical treatment or \ndietary measures, the dose must be reduced or administration discontinued (see section 4.2). \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in association \nwith epoetin treatment (see section 4.8). More severe cases have been observed with long-acting \nepoetins.At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and \nmonitored closely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, \nMircera should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatement considered.If the patient has \ndeveloped a severe cutaneous skin reaction such as SJS orTEN due to the use of Mircera, treatment \nwith ESA must not be restarted in this patient at any time. \n \nHaemoglobin concentration: In patients with chronic kidney disease, maintenance haemoglobin \nconcentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended \nin section 4.2. In clinical trials, an increased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events including \nthrombosis or cerebrovascular events including stroke was observed when ESAs were administered to \ntarget a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) (see section 4.8). \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of MIRCERA therapy has not been established in patients with \nhaemoglobinopathies, seizures, bleeding or a recent history of bleeding requiring transfusions or with \nplatelet levels greater than 500 x 109/l. Therefore, caution should be used in these patients. \n \nEffect on tumour growth: MIRCERA, like other ESAs, is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red \nblood cell production. Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour \ncells. As with all growth factors, there is a concern that ESAs could stimulate the growth of any type \nof malignancy. Two controlled clinical studies in which epoetins were administered to patients with \nvarious cancers including head and neck cancers, and breast cancer, have shown an unexplained \nexcess mortality. \n \nMisuse of MIRCERA by healthy people may lead to an excessive increase in haemoglobin. This may \nbe associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications. \n \nTraceability of MIRCERA: In order to improve the traceability of ESAs, the trade name of the \nadministered ESA should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentialy sodium free. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. There is no evidence that MIRCERA alters the \nmetabolism of other medicinal products. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of MIRCERA in pregnant women.  \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryofoetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development but indicate a class-related reversible reduction in \nfoetal weight (see section 5.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether MIRCERA is excreted in human breast milk. One animal study has shown \nexcretion of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in maternal milk. A decision on whether to \ncontinue or discontinue breast-feeding or to continue or discontinue therapy with MIRCERA should \nbe made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of MIRCERA \ntherapy to the woman.  \n \nFertility \nStudies in animals have shown no evidence of impaired fertility (see section 5.3). The potential risk \nfor humans is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMIRCERA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n(a) Summary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety data base from clinical trials comprised 3,042 CKD patients, including 1,939 patients \ntreated with MIRCERA and 1,103 with another ESA. Approximately 6% of patients treated with \nMIRCERA are expected to experience adverse reactions. The most frequent reported adverse reaction \nwas hypertension (common). \n \n(b) Tabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions in Table 2 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 2:  Adverse reactions attributed to the treatment with MIRCERA in CKD patients . \nAdverse reactions observed only during post-marketing are marked (*). \n \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Thrombocytopenia* \nNot known Pure red cell aplasia* \n\nImmune system disorders Rare Hypersensitivity Not known Anaphylactic reaction* \n\nNervous system disorders Uncommon Headache Rare Hypertensive encephalopathy \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon Hypertension \nRare Hot flush \nUncommon Thrombosis*  \nRare Pulmonary embolism* \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ndisorders \n\nRare Rash, maculopapular \n\nNot known Stevens-Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis* \nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications Uncommon Vascular access thrombosis \n\n \n(c) Description of selected adverse reactions \nCases of thrombocytopenia have been reported from post-marketing setting. A slight decrease in \nplatelet counts remaining within the normal range was observed in clinical studies. \nPlatelet counts below 100 x 109/l were observed in 7% of patients treated with MIRCERA and 4% of \npatients treated with other ESAs during clinical development. In a post-authorisation safety study with \nlong treatment exposure of up to 8.4 years, baseline platelet counts below 100 x 109/l was present in \n2.1% of patients in the MIRCERA group and 2.4% of patients in other ESAs group. During the study, \nplatelet counts below 100 x 109/l were observed yearly in 1.5% to 3.0% of patients treated with \nMIRCERA and 1.6% to 2.5% of patients treated with other ESAs.’ \n \nData from a controlled clinical trial with epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa reported an incidence of \nstroke as common. A post-authorisation safety study showed similar incidence rate of stroke between \nMIRCERA (6.3%) and reference ESAs groups (epoetin alfa, darbepoetin alfa and epoetin beta) (7%). \n \nAs with other ESAs, cases of thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, have been reported in the \npost-marketing setting (see section 4.4). \n \nNeutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) has been reported, \nfrequency unknown. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with MIRCERA must be discontinued, and \npatients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic protein (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic range of MIRCERA is wide. Individual responsiveness must be considered when \ntreatment is initiated. Overdose can result in manifestations of an exaggerated pharmacodynamic \neffect, e.g. excessive erythropoiesis. In case of excessive haemoglobin levels, treatment with \nMIRCERA should be temporarily discontinued (see section 4.2). If clinically indicated, phlebotomy \nmay be performed. \n \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antianemic preparations, ATC code: B03XA03 \n \nMechanism of action \nMIRCERA stimulates erythropoiesis by interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on progenitor cells \nin the bone marrow. Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, the active substance of MIRCERA, is \na continuous erythropoietin receptor activator that shows a different activity at the receptor level \ncharacterized by a slower association to and faster dissociation from the receptor, a reduced specific \nactivity in vitro with an increased activity in vivo, as well as an increased half-life, in contrast to \nerythropoietin. The average molecular mass is approximately 60 kDa of which the protein moiety plus \nthe carbohydrate part constitutes approximately 30 kDa. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nAs primary growth factor for erythroid development, the natural hormone erythropoietin is produced \nin the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, the \nnatural hormone erythropoietin interacts with erythroid progenitor cells to increase red cell production. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nData from correction studies with patients treated once every two weeks and once every four weeks \nshow that the haemoglobin response rates in the MIRCERA group at the end of the correction period \nwere high and comparable to comparators. The median time to response was 43 days in the MIRCERA \narm and 29 days in the comparator arm, with increases of haemoglobin within the first 6 weeks of \n0.2 g/dl/week and 0.3 g/dl/week, respectively. \n \nFour randomized controlled studies were performed in dialysis patients currently treated with \ndarbepoetin alfa or epoetin at the time of enrollment. Patients were randomized to stay on their \ntreatment at the time of enrollment or to be switched to MIRCERA in order to maintain stable \nhaemoglobin levels. At the evaluation period (week 29-36), the mean and median level of \nhaemoglobin in patients treated with MIRCERA was virtually identical to their baseline haemoglobin \nlevel. \n \nIn a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 4,038 CRF patients not on dialysis with \ntype 2 diabetes and haemoglobin levels ≤ 11 g/dL, patients received either treatment with darbepoetin \nalfa to target haemoglobin levels of 13 g/dL or placebo (see section 4.4). The study did not meet either \nprimary objective of demonstrating a reduction in risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular \nmorbidity, or end stage renal disease (ESRD). Analysis of the individual components of the composite \nendpoints showed the following HR (95% CI): death 1.05 (0.92, 1.21), stroke 1.92 (1.38, 2.68), \ncongestive heart failure (CHF) 0.89 (0.74, 1.08), myocardial infarction (MI) 0.96 (0.75, 1.23), \nhospitalisation for myocardial ischaemia 0.84 (0.55, 1.27), ESRD 1.02 (0.87, 1.18). \n \nPooled post-hoc analyses of clinical studies of ESAs have been performed in chronic renal failure \npatients (on dialysis, not on dialysis, in diabetic and non-diabetic patients). A tendency towards \nincreased risk estimates for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events associated \nwith higher cumulative ESA doses independent of the diabetes or dialysis status was observed (see \nsection 4.2 and section 4.4). \n \nErythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production. Erythropoietin receptors \nmay be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2,833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study. Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy. The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was >13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12-\n14 g/dl. In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \n\n\n\n10 \n\nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls. In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls. These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls. Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA patient-level data analysis has also been performed on more than 13,900 cancer patients (chemo-, \nradia-, chemoradia-, or no therapy) participating in 53 controlled clinical trials involving several \nepoetins. Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.06 in \nfavour of controls (95% CI: 1.00, 1.12; 53 trials and 13,933 patients) and for the cancer patients \nreceiving chemotherapy, the overall survival hazard ratio was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.11; 38 trials and \n10,441 patients). Meta-analyses also indicate consistently a significantly increased relative risk of \nthromboembolic events in cancer patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (see section \n4.4). No patients treated with MIRCERA were included in this data analysis. \nMIRCERA is not approved for treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia (see section \n4.1 and 4.4.).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta were studied in healthy volunteers \nand in anaemic patients with CKD including patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration to CKD patients not on dialysis, the maximum serum \nconcentrations of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta were observed 95 hours (median value) \nafter administration. The absolute bioavailability of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta after \nsubcutaneous administration was 54%. The observed terminal elimination half-life was 142 hours in \nCKD patients not on dialysis. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration to CKD patients on dialysis, the maximum serum \nconcentrations of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta were observed 72 hours (median value) \nafter administration. The absolute bioavailability of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta after \nsubcutaneous administration was 62% and the observed terminal elimination half-life was 139 hours \nin CKD patients on dialysis.  \n \nFollowing intravenous administration to CKD patients on dialysis, the total systemic clearance was \n0.494 ml/h per kg. The elimination half-life after intravenous administration of methoxy polyethylene \nglycol-epoetin beta is 134 hours. \n \nA comparison of serum concentrations of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta measured before \nand after haemodialysis in 41 CKD patients showed that haemodialysis has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of this medicinal product. \n \nAn analysis in 126 CKD patients showed no pharmacokinetic difference between patients on dialysis \nand patients not on dialysis. \n \nIn a single dose study, after intravenous administration, the pharmacokinetics of methoxy polyethylene \nglycol-epoetin beta are similar in patients with severe hepatic impairment as compared to healthy \nsubjects (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data show no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of cardiovascular \nsafety pharmacology, repeat dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity. \nThe carcinogenic potential of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta has not been evaluated in \nlong-term animal studies. It did not induce a proliferative response in non-haematological tumor cell \n\n\n\n11 \n\nlines in vitro. In a six-month rat toxicity study no tumorigenic or unexpected mitogenic responses were \nobserved in non-haematological tissues. In addition, using a panel of human tissues, the in vitro \nbinding of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was only observed in target cells (bone marrow \nprogenitor cells). \n \nNo significant placental transfer of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was observed in the rat, \nand studies in animals have not shown any harmful effect on pregnancy, embryofoetal development, \nparturition or postnatal development. There was however a class-related reversible reduction in foetal \nweight and a decrease in postnatal body-weight gain of offspring at the doses causing exaggerated \npharmacodynamic effects in mothers. Physical, cognitive, or sexual developments in the offspring of \nmothers receiving methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta during gestation and lactation were not \naffected. When MIRCERA was administered subcutaneously to male and female rats prior to and \nduring mating, reproductive performance, fertility, and sperm assessment parameters were not affected.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What MIRCERA is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use MIRCERA \n3. How to use MIRCERA \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store MIRCERA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What MIRCERA is and what it is used for \n \nThis medicine is prescribed to you because you have anaemia caused by your chronic kidney disease \nand associated whith typical symptoms, such as tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath. This \nmeans that you have too few red blood cells and your haemoglobin level is too low (your body’s \ntissues might not receive enough oxygen). \n \nMIRCERA is indicated to treat only the symptomatic anaemia caused by chronic kidney disease. Its \nuse is limited to adult patients (aged 18 years or older). \n \nMIRCERA is a medicine produced by gene-technology. Like the natural hormone erythropoietin, \nMIRCERA increases the number of red blood cells and haemoglobin level in your blood. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use MIRCERA \n \nDo not use MIRCERA \n• if you are allergic to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or to any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nThe safety and efficacy of MIRCERA therapy in other indications, including anaemia in patients with \ncancer, has not been established. \n \nBefore treatment with MIRCERA \n• A condition called Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA, stopped or reduced production of red blood \n\ncells) due to anti-erythropoietin antibodies was observed in some patients treated with \nerythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), including MIRCERA. \n\n• If your doctor suspects or confirms that you have these antibodies in your blood, you must not \nbe treated with MIRCERA. \n\n• If you are a patient with hepatitis C and you receive interferon and ribavirin you should discuss  \nthis with your doctor because a combination of ESAs with interferon and ribavirin has lead to a \nloss of effect and development of PRCA, a severe form of anemia, in rare cases. ESAs are not \napproved in the management of anaemia associated with hepatitis C. \n\n• If you are a patient with chronic kidney disease and anemia treated with an ESA and are also \na cancer patient you should be aware that ESAs, might have a negative impact on your \ncondition. You should discuss options for anemia treatment with your doctor. \n\n• It is not known if MIRCERA has a different effect in patients with haemoglobinopathies \n(disorders associated with abnormal haemoglobin), past or present bleeding, seizures or with a \nhigh blood platelet count. If you have any of these conditions, your doctor will discuss it with \nyou and must treat you with caution. \n\n• Healthy people should not use MIRCERA. Using it can lead to too high haemoglobin levels and \ncause problems with the heart or blood vessels that may be life-threatening. \n\n \nDuring treatment with MIRCERA \n• If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to \n\nMIRCERA, your doctor will check your dose of MIRCERA because repeatedly increasing your \ndose of MIRCERA if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a \nproblem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke \nand death.  \n\n• Your doctor may initiate treatment with MIRCERA if your haemoglobin level is 10 g/dl \n(6.21 mmol/l) or less. After initiation of therapy, your doctor will seek to maintain your \nhaemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l). \n\n• Your doctor will check the amount of iron in your blood before and during MIRCERA \ntreatment. If the amount is too low your doctor may give you an additional iron supplement. \n\n• Your doctor will check your blood pressure before and during your MIRCERA treatment. If \nyour blood pressure is high and cannot be controlled, either by appropriate medicines or a \nspecial diet, your doctor will interrupt your MIRCERA treatment or reduce the dose. \n\n• Your doctor will check that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high \nhaemoglobin could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and \ncould increase risk of thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke \nand death.  \n\n• Contact your doctor if you feel tired, weak or have shortness of breath, because this could mean \nthat your MIRCERA treatment is not effective. Your doctor will check that you do not have \nother causes of anaemia and may perform blood tests or examine your bone marrow. If you \nhave developed PRCA, your MIRCERA treatment will be discontinued. You will not receive \nanother ESA and your doctor will treat you for this condition. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nTreatment with MIRCERA is not recommended in children and adolescents, because it has not been \nstudied in these patients. \n \nTake special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: MIRCERA is one \nof a group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human protein \nerythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional will always record the exact product you are using. \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nSerious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. \nSJS/TEN can appear initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters \non the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. \nThese serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may \nprogress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications. \n \nIf you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms stop taking Mircera and contact your \ndoctor or seek medical attention immediately. \n \nOther medicines and MIRCERA \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nNo interaction studies have been performed. There is no evidence that MIRCERA interacts with other \nmedicines. \n \n MIRCERA with food and drink \nFood and drink do not affect MIRCERA. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \nMIRCERA has not been studied in pregnant or breast-feeding women. \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor \nwill consider what is the best treatment for you during pregnancy. \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed. Your doctor will advise if you \nshould stop or continue breast-feeding and stop or continue your treatment. \nMIRCERA has not shown evidence of impaired fertility in animals. The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. \n \nDriving and using machines \nMIRCERA does not affect your ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of MIRCERA \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use MIRCERA \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure.  \n \nYour doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of your anaemia. \n \nIf you do not respond adequately to MIRCERA, your doctor will check your dose and will inform you \nif you need to change doses of MIRCERA. \n \nTreatment with MIRCERA must be started under the supervision of a healthcare professional. \nFurther injections can be given by a healthcare professional or, after you have been trained, you can \ninject MIRCERA yourself (see instructions at the end of this leaflet.) \n \nMIRCERA can be injected under the skin in the abdomen, arm or thigh; or into a vein. Your doctor \nwill decide which is best for you. \n \nYour doctor will carry out regular blood tests to monitor how your anaemia is responding to treatment \nby measuring your haemoglobin level. \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\n• If you are not currently treated with an ESA \nIf you are not on dialysis, the recommended starting dose of MIRCERA is 1.2 micrograms for every \nkilogram of your body weight to be administered under the skin once every month as a single injection. \nAlternatively, your doctor may decide to administer a starting dose of MIRCERA of 0.6 micrograms \nfor every kilogram of your body weight. The dose is to be administered once every two weeks as a \nsingle injection under the skin or into a vein. Once your anaemia is corrected your doctor may change \nyour dosing to once a month administration. \nIf you are on dialysis, the recommended starting dose is 0.6 micrograms for every kilogram of your \nbody weight. The dose is to be administered once every two weeks as a single injection under the skin \norinto a vein. Once your anaemia iscorrected your doctor may change your dosing to once a month \nadministration. \n\n \nYour doctor may increase or decrease your dose or temporarily stop your treatment to adjust your \nhaemoglobin level, as appropriate for you. Dose changes will not be made more often than once a \nmonth. \n \n• If you are currently being treated with another ESA \nYour doctor may replace your current medicine with MIRCERA. Your doctor will decide to treat you \nwith MIRCERA administered as a single injection once a month. Your doctor will calculate your \nMIRCERA starting dose based on the last dose of your previous medicine. The first MIRCERA dose \nwill be given on the planned injection day of your previous medicine. \n \nYour doctor may increase or decrease your dose or temporarily stop your treatment to adjust your \nhaemoglobin to an appropriate level for you. Dose changes will not be made more often than once a \nmonth. \n \nIf you use more MIRCERA than you should \nPlease contact your doctor or pharmacist if you used too large a dose of MIRCERA as it may be \nnecessary to perform some blood tests and interrupt your treatment. \n \nIf you forget to use MIRCERA \nIf you miss a dose of MIRCERA administer the missed dose as soon as you remember and talk to your \ndoctor about when to use the next doses. \n \nIf you stop using MIRCERA \nTreatment with MIRCERA is normally long-term. It can, however, be stopped on the advice of your \ndoctor at any time. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below:  \n \nA common side effect (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) is hypertension (high blood pressure). \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 pleople) are: \n• headache \n• vascular access thrombosis (blood clots in your dialysis access). \n thrombocytopenia \n thrombosis  \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people) are: \n• hypertensive encephalopathy (very high blood pressure that can result in headache, especially \n\nsudden, stabbing, migraine-like headache, confusion, speech disturbances, fits or convulsions).  \n• pulmonary embolism. \n• maculo-papular rash (red skin reaction that can include pimples or spots) \n• hot flush \n• hypersensitivity (allergic reaction that can cause unusual wheezing or difficulty in breathing; \n\nswollen tongue, face or throat, or swelling around the injection site, or make you feel light-\nheaded, faint or cause you to collapse).  \n\nIf you have these symptoms please contact your doctor immediately to receive treatment. \n \nDuring clinical studies patients had a slight decrease in their platelet blood counts. There have been  \nreports of platelet counts below the normal range (thrombocytopenia) in the post-marketing setting. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including cases of anaphylactic reaction and serious skin rashes including \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in association \nwith epoetin treatement. These can appear as reddish target-like macules or circular patches often with \ncentral blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes and can be \npreceded by fever and flu-like symptoms. Stop using Mircera if you develop these symptoms and \ncontact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately, see also section 2. \n \nAs with other ESAs, cases of thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, have been reported in the \npost-marketing setting. \n \nA condition called Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA, stopped or reduced production of red blood cells) \ndue to anti-erythropoietin antibodies was observed in some patients treated with ESAs, including \nMIRCERA. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V*. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5.

Keep the syringe in \nthe box to protect it from light and \nallow it to reach room temperature \nfor at least 30 minutes. \n \n• Not allowing the medicine to \n\ncome to room temperature could \nresult in an uncomfortable \ninjection, and it may be difficult \nto depress the plunger.  \n\n• Do not warm up the syringe in \nany other way. \n\n \n\nRemove the plastic tray of the \nMIRCERA pre-filled syringe from \nthe box without peeling back the \nprotective film. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nStep 2: Clean your hands \n\n \n \n\nDisinfect your hands well with soap \nand warm water or hands sanitizer. \n\nStep 3: Unpack and visually inspect the pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\nPeel back the protective film from \nthe plastic tray and remove the \nneedle and the syringe, holding the \nsyringe by the middle of the body \nwithout touching the release clips. \n \n• Only handle the syringe by the \n\nbody, because any contact with \nthe release clips could cause \npremature release of the safety \ndevice. \n\n \n\n \n\nExamine the syringe and check the \nexpiration date on the syringe and \nbox. This is important to ensure that \nthe syringe and medicine are safe to \nuse. \n \nDo NOT use the syringe if: \n• You have accidentally dropped \n\nthe syringe. \n\n\n\n68 \n\n  \n\n• Any part of the syringe appears to \nbe damaged. \n\n• The contents are cloudy, hazy or \ncontain particles. \n\n• The expiration date has passed. \n\n \n \n\nStep 4. Attach the needle to the syringe \n\n \n \n\nGrasp the packaged needle firmly in \nboth hands. Break the seal of the \nneedle, using a twisting motion, and \nremove the needle cap as pictured.  \nImmediately throw away the needle \ncap in the sharps/ puncture-resistant \ncontainer or sharps container. \n• Do not remove the needle shield \n\nthat protects the needle. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nGrasp the syringe and the rubber tip \ncap firmly and remove the rubber tip \ncap from the syringe (bend and pull). \n• Do not touch the release clips of \n\nthe safety device. \n\n• Do not push the plunger. \n\n• Do not pull on the plunger. \n\n \n\n \n\nAttach the needle to the syringe by \npushing it firmly onto the syringe. \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nStep5. Remove the needle shield and prepare for injection \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nHold the syringe firmly with one \nhand and pull off the needle shield \nwith the other hand. Throw away the \nneedle shield in the puncture-\nresistant container or sharps \ncontainer. \n• Do not touch the needle or let it \n\ntouch any surface, as the needle \nmay become contaminated and \nmay cause injury and pain if \ntouched. \n\n• You may see a drop of liquid at \nthe end of the needle. This is \nnormal. \n\n• Never reattach the needle shield \nafter removal. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTo remove air bubbles from the pre-\nfilled syringe, hold the syringe with \nthe needle pointing up.  \nTap the syringe gently to bring any \nbubbles to the top.  \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nPush the plunger up slowly to the \nremove all air,, as shown to you by a \nhealthcare professional. \n\n \nStep 6. Perform the injection  \n\nThere are two different ways (routes) to inject MIRCERA into your body.  Follow the \nrecommendations of your healthcare professional about how you should inject MIRCERA.  \n \n\n \n\nSubcutaneous route: \n\nIf you are advised to inject MIRCERA under your skin, please administer your dose as \ndescribed below. \n \n\n \n \n\nChoose one of the recommended \ninjection sites as shown. \nYou may inject MIRCERA into the \nupper arm, thigh or abdomen, except \naround the navel (belly button). \n \n• You should use a different \n\ninjection site each time you \nadminister an injection, at least \nthree centimeters from the area \nyou used for the previous \ninjection.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n71 \n\n• Do not inject areas that could be \nirritated by a belt or waistband. \nDo not inject into moles, scars, \nbruises, or areas where the skin is \ntender, red, hard or not intact.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nClean the chosen injection site area \nusing an alcohol pad to reduce the \nrisk of infection; carefully follow the \ninstructions of the alcohol pad. \n \n• Let the skin dry for \n\napproximately 10 seconds. \n\n• Be sure not to touch the cleaned \narea prior to the injection and do \nnot fan or blow on the clean area. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nTo be sure the needle can be inserted \ncorrectly under the skin, use your \nfree hand to pinch a fold of loose skin \nat the clean injection site. Pinching \nthe skin is important to ensure that \nyou inject under the skin (into fatty \ntissue) but not any deeper (into \nmuscle). Injection into muscle could \nresult in an uncomfortable injection. \n \n \nFully insert the needle into the skin \nin a quick, “dart-like” motion. Slowly \npush the plunger with the thumb \nwhile holding the syringe with the \nforefinger and the middle finger \nagainst the finger grips until all the \nmedicine is injected. \nDo not move the needle while it is \ninserted in the skin \n \n\n  \n \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nDo not release the plunger before the \nend of injection or before the plunger \nis completely depressed.  \nTake the needle out of the skin \nWITHOUT releasing the plunger. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nRelease the plunger, allowing the \nneedle guard to protect the needle. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nNow, the tear-off label can be \nremoved, if necessary. \n\n \nPlace a sterile cotton ball or gauze over the injection site and press for several seconds. \n• Do not rub the injection site with dirty hand or cloth. \n• If needed, you may cover the injection site with a small bandage. \nDispose of the syringe: \n• Throw away used syringes in a sharps/ puncture-resistant container. \n• Do not try to replace the needle shield on the needle. \n• Do not throw away used syringes or the sharps/ puncture-resistant container in \nhousehold trash and do not recycle them. \n• Dispose of the full container as instructed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist. \n \nIntravenous route: \n \nIf your healthcare professional has recommended injection of MIRCERA into a vein, you \nshould follow the procedure described below.  \nAfter preparation of the syringe as described in steps 1 to 5: \n \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nWipe off the venous port of the \nhemodialysis as instructed by your \nhealthcare provider  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nInsert the needle of the pre-filled \nsyringe into the cleaned venous \nport. \n \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\nPush the plunger with the thumb \nwhile holding the syringe with the \nforefinger and the middle finger \nagainst the finger grips until all the \nmedicine is injected. \nRemove the pre-filled syringe from \nthe venous port WITHOUT \nreleasing the plunger.  \n \nRelease the plunger, allowing the \nneedle guard to protect the needle. \nNow, the tear-off label can be \nremoved, if necessary. \n \n\n \nDispose of the syringe  \n\nThrow away used syringes in a puncture-resistant container. \n \n• Do not try to replace the shield on the needle. \n\n• Do not throw away used syringes or the puncture-resistant container in household trash \nand do not recycle them. \n\n• Dispose of the full container as instructed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
