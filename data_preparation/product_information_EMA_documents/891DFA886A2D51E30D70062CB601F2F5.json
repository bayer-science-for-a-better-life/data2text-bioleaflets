CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of adult patients with Parkinson’s disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nNumient is recommended to be dosed orally, approximately every 6 hours. Dosing this medicinal product \nmore than 5 times per day is not recommended. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nEach capsule strength may be used alone, or in combination with other capsule strengths as required. Use of \nthis medicinal product with other levodopa containing medicinal products has not been studied. \n \nDose recommendations should be followed at initiation of treatment and adapted according to clinical \nresponse. \n \nInitial dose and titration in levodopa-naïve patients  \n \nThe starting dose is one capsule containing 95 mg of levodopa and 23.75 mg carbidopa three times daily \n(TID) for the first three days; this may be increased to a dose of one modified-release hard capsule \ncontaining 145 mg of levodopa and 36.25 mg carbidopa three times daily from Day 4 of treatment.  \n \nFurther increases should be individualized based on clinical response.  The daily dose must be determined by \ncareful titration. Patients should be maintained on the lowest dose required to achieve symptomatic control \nand to minimize adverse reactions such as dyskinesia and nausea.   \n \nThere is limited experience with a total daily dose of more than 1,170 mg of levodopa when administered in \nlevodopa-naïve patients.  \n \nConverting patients from other levodopa/ dopa-decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor (carbidopa or benserazide) \nimmediate release medicinal products to Numient  \n \nAs a result of Numient’s pharmacokinetic characteristics, the doses and dosing frequency of Numient are not \ndirectly interchangeable with those of other levodopa/DDC inhibitor immediate release medicinal products \n(see section 5.2). \n \nWhen patients are initially converted from immediate release levodopa/DDC inhibitor medicinal products to \nNumient, the dosing conversion guidelines provided in Table 1 are recommended for initial dosing. \n \nTable 1: Guidelines for initial conversion from immediate release (IR) levodopa/DDC inhibitor medicinal \nproducts to Numient in Parkinson’s disease patients. \n \nTotal daily dose of levodopa \n\nin immediate release \nlevodopa/DDC inhibitor (mg) \n\nInitial total daily dose of \nNumient  \n\n(levodopa in mg) \n\nSuggested initial dose of  \nNumient \n\n400 to 549 855 3 hard capsules 95 mg/23.75 mg TID \n550 to 749 1140 4 hard capsules 95 mg/23.75 mg TID \n750 to 949 1305 3 hard capsules 145 mg/36.25 mg TID \n\n950 to 1249 1755 3 hard capsules 195 mg/48.75 mg TID \n≥1250 2340 \n\n \n2205 \n\n4 hard capsules 195 mg/48.75 mg TID \nor \n\n3 hard capsules x 245 mg/61.25 mg TID \n \nWhen patients are initially converted from immediate release levodopa/DDC inhibitor plus catechol-O-\nmethyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors (such as entacapone) to Numient the dosing conversion guidelines \nprovided in Table 2 are recommended for initial dosing. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2: Guidelines for initial conversion from immediate release levodopa/DDC inhibitor plus catechol-O-\nmethyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors (such as entacapone) to Numient in Parkinson’s disease patients \n \nTotal daily dose of levodopa \n\n(mg) in levodopa/DDC \ninhibitor/entacapone \n\n Initial total daily dose of \nNumient  \n\n(levodopa in mg) \n\nSuggested initial dose of  \nNumient \n\n400 to 549 1140 4 hard capsules 95 mg/23.75 mg TID \n550 to 749 1470 2 hard capsules 245 mg/61.25 mg TID \n750 to 949 1755 3 hard capsules 195 mg/48.75 mg TID \n\n950 to 1249 2205 3 hard capsules 245 mg/61.25 mg TID \n≥1250 2940 4 hard capsules 245 mg/61.25 mg TID \n \n\nWhen converting patients from levodopa/DDC inhibitor medicinal products to Numient, the dose should be \nadjusted to maintain sufficient symptomatic control. The dosing frequency may be changed from three times \na day to a maximum of five times a day if sufficient symptomatic control is not observed. In studies in \nadvanced Parkinson’s disease patients, there is limited data using doses above 2,450 mg of levodopa and \n612.5 mg of carbidopa given as Numient. \n \nThe final total daily dose of levodopa from Numient is about double that of the final total daily dose of \nlevodopa from immediate release tablets while the final total daily dose of levodopa from Numient is about \nthree times that of the final total daily dose of levodopa from the combination of levodopa/DDC \ninhibitor/entacapone. \n \nConverting patients specifically from other levodopa/DDC inhibitor modified-release medicinal products to \nNumient \n \nFor patients currently treated with other levodopa/DDC inhibitor modified-release medicinal products, \nlimited information regarding conversion to Numient is available. The initial total daily dose of Numient \ndescribed in Table 1 above may need to be decreased by approximately 30% for patients converting \nspecifically from levodopa/DDC inhibitor modified-release medicinal products to Numient. \n \nMaintenance \n \nBecause Parkinson's disease is progressive, periodic clinical evaluations are recommended. Therapy should \nbe individualized and adjusted for each patient according to the desired therapeutic response. \n \nAddition of other medicinal products for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease \n \nModified-release levodopa/carbidopa may be used together with other medicinal products for the treatment \nof Parkinson’s disease. However, dose adjustments may be required (see section 4.5). \n \nInterruption of therapy  \n \nSporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been \nassociated with dose reductions and withdrawal of levodopa/carbidopa containing medicinal products. \nPatients should be observed carefully if abrupt reduction or discontinuation of the modified-release \nlevodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product is required, especially if the patient is receiving antipsychotics \n(see section 4.4). \n \nIf general anaesthesia is required, the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product may \nbe continued as long as the patient is permitted to take oral medicinal products. If therapy is interrupted \ntemporarily, the usual dose should be administered as soon as the patient is able to take oral medicinal \nproducts. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment of the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product is required for elderly \npatients. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nImpact of renal function on levodopa/carbidopa clearance is limited (see section 5.2). Numient has not been \nstudied in patients with renal impairment. It is recommended to administer this medicinal product cautiously \nto patients with severe renal disease (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNumient has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. It is recommended to administer this \nmedicinal product cautiously to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Numient in children under 18 years of age have not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nNumient should be administered with a glass of water and can be taken with or without food. A high-fat, \nhigh-calorie meal delays the absorption of levodopa by two hours. Further, high protein meals may impair \nclinical response by decreasing the absorption of levodopa (see section 4.5). Therefore, Numient should not \nbe taken at the same time as high protein meals. The modified-release hard capsule should be swallowed \nwhole, and not chewed or crushed, in order to maintain the modified-release effect of the levodopa/carbidopa \nmedicinal product. Alternatively, for patients that have difficulty swallowing a capsule, this medicinal \nproduct may be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the entire contents on a small \namount (e.g., 2 tablespoons) of soft food such as apple sauce, yoghurt, or pudding. The medicinal \nproduct/food mixture should be swallowed completely and immediately without chewing and should not be \nstored for future use. It cannot be excluded that heating may change the properties of the medicinal product. \nTherefore, the medicinal product should not be heated or added to hot food. \n \nProducts containing ferrous sulphate should be administered separately from levodopa/carbidopa, with the \nlongest possible time interval between administrations (see section 4.5). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n- Narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \n- Phaeochromocytoma.  \n \n- Co-administration with non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. These inhibitors must be \n\ndiscontinued at least two weeks prior to initiating therapy (see section 4.5).  \n \n- A previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/or non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCNS effects and mental disturbances \n \nSomnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset \nLevodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset (see section 4.7). Sudden \nonset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported \nvery rarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating \nmachines during treatment (see section 4.7). Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of \nsudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of dose or \ntermination of therapy may be considered. \n \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) \nSporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling NMS have been reported in association with dose \nreductions or withdrawal of levodopa/carbidopa medicinal products. NMS is a life-threatening syndrome \ncharacterized by fever or hyperthermia and can be associated with rhabdomyolysis. Neurological findings, \nincluding muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes; other \ndisturbances, such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnoea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension; \nlaboratory findings, such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leucocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased \nserum myoglobin have been reported. Therefore, patients must be monitored carefully when the dose of \nlevodopa/carbidopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving antipsychotics \n(see section 4.2). \n \nMental disturbances \nPatients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioural changes, which may be severe, \nincluding psychotic-like and suicidal behaviour during levodopa treatment or after starting or increasing the \ndose of levodopa. This abnormal thinking and behaviour can consist of one or more of a variety of \nmanifestations including anxiety, depression, paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, \npsychotic-like behaviour, disorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium.  \n \nPatients with a major psychotic disorder or a history of psychotic disorder must be treated cautiously with \nlevodopa/carbidopa because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medicinal products \nused to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the \neffectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa. Concomitant use of antipsychotics should be monitored carefully for \nworsening of Parkinson’s motor symptoms especially when D2-receptor antagonists are used (see section \n4.5). \n \nImpulse control disorders  \nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and carers \nshould be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathological \ngambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive \neating, and dopamine dysregulation syndrome can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or \nother dopaminergic treatments containing levodopa. Review of treatment is recommended if such symptoms \ndevelop. \n \nDyskinesias \nMedicinal products containing levodopa cause dyskinesias that may require treatment adjustment. Carbidopa \npermits more levodopa to reach the brain and more dopamine to be formed increasing the risk for certain \nadverse CNS reactions including dyskinesia. It is recommended to monitor patients for the onset or evolution \nof dyskinesia and to adjust levodopa/carbidopa doses accordingly. \n \nOrthostatic hypotension \nLevodopa/carbidopa can cause orthostatic hypotension. Levodopa/carbidopa should be used with caution in \ncase of concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause orthostatic hypotension, e.g. anti-hypertensive \nmedicinal products. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nGlaucoma \n \nPatients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously with levodopa/carbidopa provided the \nintraocular pressure is well-controlled and the patient is monitored carefully for changes in intraocular \npressure during therapy. \n \nMelanoma \n \nEpidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease have a higher risk (2- to \napproximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased \nrisk observed was due to Parkinson’s disease or other factors, such as medicinal products used to treat \nParkinson’s disease, is unclear.  \n \nFor the reasons stated above, patients and prescribing physicians are advised to monitor for melanomas \nfrequently and on a regular basis when using levodopa/carbidopa, especially in patients with suspicious, \nundiagnosed skin lesions or a history of melanoma. Periodic skin examinations performed by appropriately \nqualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists) are recommended.  \n \nLaboratory testing \n \nDecreased haemoglobin and haematocrit have been observed on long-term levodopa/carbidopa treatment. \nPeriodic evaluation of hepatic, haematopoietic, cardiovascular and renal function is recommended during \nextended therapy. \n \nLevodopa/carbidopa preparations may provide a false-positive test result for ketone bodies, if a test strip is \nused for determining any ketonuria. This reaction does not change upon boiling the urine sample. False \nnegative results might be obtained upon application of glucose-oxidase methods for glucosuria. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nLevodopa/carbidopa should be administered cautiously to patients with ischemic heart disease, severe \ncardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or history of \npeptic ulcer disease (because of the possibility of upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage) and a history of \nconvulsions.  \n \nCare should be exercised in administering levodopa/carbidopa to patients with a history of myocardial \ninfarction who have residual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmias.  In such patients, cardiac function \nshould be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dose adjustment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors \n \nNon-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to treatment \ninitiation with the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product (see section 4.3).  \nNumient can be taken concomitantly with the recommended dose of an MAO inhibitor, which is selective for \nMAO inhibitor type B such as selegiline and rasagiline. There is a recognized drug-drug interaction of \nlevodopa with type B MAO inhibitors which potentiates the effects of levodopa. The combination may be \nassociated with severe orthostatic hypotension. \n \nThe dose of levodopa may need to be reduced when an MAO inhibitor selective for type B is added. Patients \nshould be maintained on the lowest dose required to achieve symptomatic control and to minimize adverse \nreactions.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nDopamine D2 receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines and isoniazid \n \nDopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone), benzodiazepines and \nisoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. Patients taking these medicinal products together \nwith levodopa/carbidopa should be monitored carefully for loss of therapeutic response. \n \nTricyclic antidepressants \n \nThere have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the \nconcomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and levodopa/carbidopa. \n \nAntihypertensives \n \nSymptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when combinations of levodopa and a decarboxylase \ninhibitor are added to the treatment of patients already receiving certain antihypertensives. Dose adjustment \nof the antihypertensive medicinal products may be required during the titration phase of treatment with this \nmodified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product. \n \nAnticholinergics \n \nAnticholinergic medicinal products can work synergistically with levodopa, in order to improve tremor. \nConcurrent use can, however, cause a worsening of involuntary motor disorders. Anticholinergic medicinal \nproducts may impair the effect of levodopa, due to a delayed absorption. A dose adjustment of levodopa may \nbe required. \n \nPhenytoin and papaverine \n \nThere have been rare reports that the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease are reversed by \nphenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these medicinal products with levodopa/carbidopa should be \ncarefully monitored for loss of therapeutic response. \n \nCOMT inhibitors \n \nThe effect of co-administration of this modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule product and COMT \ninhibitors such as entacapone has not been studied. The addition of entacapone to levodopa/carbidopa has \nbeen demonstrated to increase the levodopa bioavailability by 30%. The dose of the modified-release \nlevodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product may need to be decreased with concomitant use of COMT \ninhibitors. \n \nFerrous salts \n \nLevodopa/carbidopa and ferrous salts or multivitamins containing ferrous salts should be co-administered \nwith caution. Ferrous salts can form chelates with levodopa and carbidopa. Products containing ferrous \nsulphate and levodopa/carbidopa should be administered separately with the longest possible time interval \nbetween administrations (see section 4.2). \n \nAlcohol interaction \n \nIn vivo, co-administration of Numient with up to 40% volume-to-volume (v/v) alcohol did not result in dose-\ndumping of levodopa or carbidopa. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nFood interaction \n \nIn healthy adults, oral administration of Numient after a high-fat, high-calorie meal reduced levodopa Cmax \n21% while the overall extent of absorption of levodopa (AUCinf) was similar (13% increase) to that observed \nin the fasted state (see section 5.2). Administration with a high-fat, high-calorie meal delays levodopa \nabsorption by up to 2 hours (see section 4.2). \n \nFollowing administration of the modified-release hard capsule contents sprinkled over a small quantity (e.g., \n2 tablespoons) of soft food such as apple sauce, yoghurt, or pudding, the rate and extent of absorption of \nlevodopa was similar to that observed in the fasted state. \n \nLevodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport, therefore high protein meals may impair the \nabsorption of levodopa. \n \nEffect of levodopa and carbidopa on the metabolism of other medicinal products \n \nInhibition or induction effects of levodopa and carbidopa have not been investigated.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of levodopa/carbidopa in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Numient is not recommended during pregnancy \nand in women of childbearing potential not using contraception, unless the benefits for the mother outweigh \nthe possible risks to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nCarbidopa is excreted in rat milk, but it is not known whether carbidopa or its metabolites are excreted in \nhuman breast milk. In a study of one breastfeeding mother with Parkinson’s disease, excretion of levodopa in \nhuman milk was reported. There is insufficient information on the effects of levodopa/carbidopa or their \nmetabolites in newborns/infants. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Numient. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of levodopa or carbidopa on human fertility. Effects of levodopa on fertility \nwere evaluated in mouse studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLevodopa may have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Certain side effects such as \nsleepiness and dizziness that have been reported with this modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule \nmedicinal product may affect some patients' ability to drive or operate machinery.  \n \nPatients being treated with this modified-release levodopa/carbidopa capsule medicinal product and \npresenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or \nengaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death \n(e.g. operating machines), until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also section 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with Numient were nausea, occurring in approximately 12% \nof all patients; dizziness, headache, and dyskinesia, each occurring in approximately 8% of all patients; and \ninsomnia, occurring in approximately 6% of all patients. Serious events of gastrointestinal haemorrhage \n(uncommon) and of allergic oedema (uncommon) were reported in the clinical studies with Numient. A \nsymptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rhabdomyolysis may occur with \nlevodopa/carbidopa medicinal products, although no cases have been identified in clinical studies with \nNumient.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class (SOC) and frequency (Table 3). Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥\n1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \nWithin each frequency category, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 3.

It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms and signs \n \nThe acute symptoms of levodopa/DDC inhibitor overdose can be expected to arise from dopaminergic \noverstimulation. Doses of a few grams may result in CNS disturbances, with an increasing likelihood of \ncardiovascular disturbance (e.g. hypotension, sinus tachycardia) and more severe psychiatric problems at \nhigher doses. Levodopa overdose may give rise to systemic complications, secondary to dopaminergic \noverstimulation. \n \nTreatment \n \nManagement of acute overdose with levodopa/DDC preparations is the same as management of acute \noverdose with levodopa. Pyridoxine is not effective in reversing the actions of this combination medicinal \nproduct. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be instituted and the patient should be observed carefully \nfor the development of arrhythmias; if required, give appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy. Further \nmanagement should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where \navailable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson drugs, dopaminergic agents, ATC code: N04BA02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLevodopa is a precursor of dopamine, and is given as dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease.  \n \nCarbidopa is a peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor. It prevents metabolism of levodopa \nto dopamine in the peripheral circulation, ensuring that a higher proportion of the dose reaches the brain, \nwhere dopamine exerts its therapeutic effects. A lower dose of levodopa can be used when it is co-\nadministered with carbidopa, reducing the incidence and severity of peripheral side effects. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nWhen levodopa is administered orally, it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so \nthat only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. For this \nreason, large doses of levodopa are required for adequate therapeutic effect and these may often be \naccompanied by nausea and other adverse reactions, some of which are attributable to dopamine formed in \nextracerebral tissues. \n \nCarbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does \nnot affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system. Since its decarboxylase inhibiting \nactivity is limited to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa \navailable for delivery to the brain. The addition of carbidopa to levodopa reduces the peripheral effects \n(nausea, vomiting) due to decarboxylation of levodopa; however, carbidopa does not decrease the adverse \nreactions due to the central effects of levodopa. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nLevodopa-naïve patients with Parkinson’s disease \nAPEX-PD \nThe effectiveness of Numient in patients with early Parkinson’s disease was established in a randomized, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel-group, 30-week clinical trial in 381 patients who had a \nmedian disease duration of 1 year and limited or no prior exposure to levodopa and dopamine agonists. \nPatients continued on stable concomitant anti-Parkinson medicinal product. Eligible patients were \nrandomized (1:1:1:1) to placebo or one of three fixed levodopa/carbidopa doses of 145 mg/36.25 mg, \n245 mg/61.25 mg, or 390 mg/97.5 mg, three times a day. Patients were not allowed to receive supplemental \nlevodopa or catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors. Patients receiving the modified-release \nlevodopa/carbidopa medicinal product initiated treatment at 95 mg levodopa/23.75 mg carbidopa three times \ndaily (TID). The dose was increased starting on Day 4 and the highest target dose (390 mg levodopa/97.5 mg \ncarbidopa TID) was achieved by Day 22. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating \nScale (UPDRS) Part II (activities of daily living) score plus Part III motor score at week 30 or early \ntermination. Each of the three modified-release levodopa/carbidopa treatments was statistically significantly \nsuperior to placebo on the primary measure (Table 4). \n \nTable 4: Mean change from baseline in UPDRS Part II plus Part III score at week 30 (or at early \n\ntermination) in levodopa naïve patients with Parkinson’s disease (APEX-PD) \n \n\n Mean UPDRS (Part II and Part III) Scorea) \n\nTreatment Baselineb) \nWeek 30 \n\n(or at early termination) \n\nChange from baseline \nat week 30 \n\n (or at early termination)c) \n    \n\nPlacebo 36.5 35.9 −0.6 \nNumient 145 mgd) 36.1 24.4 −11.7 e) \nNumient 245 mgd) 38.2 25.3 −12.9 e)  \nNumient 390 mgd) 36.3 21.4 −14.9 e) \n\na) For the UPDRS, higher scores indicate greater severity of impairment \nb) All values based on 361 patients from the Intent to Treat population who had valid End of Study values \nc) Negative numbers indicate improvement as compared with the baseline value \nd) Three times per day \ne) P-value is less than 0.05 versus placebo  \n \nPatients with advanced Parkinson’s disease \nThe efficacy and safety of Numient in patients with advanced stage Parkinson’s disease have been evaluated \nin 2 double-blind, active-controlled studies: parallel study ADVANCE-PD (study IPX066-B09-02; 22 \nweeks) and cross-over study ASCEND-PD (study IPX066-B-09-06 Part 1; 11 weeks). \n \nIn both studies the primary endpoint was the percentage “off” time during waking hours. The main \nsecondary endpoints included “off” time, “on” time without troublesome dyskinesia, and UPDRS Parts II+III \nscore. In the ADVANCE-PD study, the Clinical Global Impression of Change was also assessed. \n \nADVANCE-PD \nThe ADVANCE-PD study was a 22-week study consisting of a 3-week dose adjustment of pre-study \nimmediate release levodopa/carbidopa treatment prior to a 6-week conversion to Numient. Next, patients \nwere randomized to a double-blind, 13-week study treatment period of either optimized immediate release \nlevodopa/carbidopa treatment or Numient. A total of 471 included patients had been maintained on a stable \nregimen of at least 400 mg per day of levodopa prior to entry into the trial. Dosing of concomitant anti-\nParkinson medicinal products was kept stable. Patients were not allowed to receive supplemental \nlevodopa/carbidopa or catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor medicinal products during the trial. \nA total of 393 patients (mean age 63.2 years; 65% male patients) were randomized.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nASCEND-PD \nThe ASCEND-PD study was a randomized, double-blind, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover study in which \n110 patients on a stable regimen of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (LCE) containing at least 400 mg per day \nof levodopa were included. Minimum dosing frequency was four times per day for at least 4 weeks upon \nentry into the trial. Concomitant anti-Parkinson medicinal products were kept stable during the study. LCE \ntreatment was converted into Numient over a 6-week period. Following this dose conversion, 91 study \npatients (mean age: 64.1 years; 75% male patients) were randomized to receive Numient followed by pre-\nstudy LCE or vice versa. All efficacy data is based on 84 patients who completed the study with the \nexception of patient diary data which is based on 83. Each double-blind study period lasted 2 weeks.  In \nbetween these periods, all patients received open-label Numient treatment for 1 week. \n \nThe most frequently recorded concomitant medicinal products for Parkinson’s disease in randomized \npatients were dopamine agonists (64%), and MAO inhibitors (37%). \n \nResults \nMain study results are summarized in Table 5. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nTable 5: Main results of studies in advanced Parkinson’s disease \n \n\nStudy ADVANCE-PD ASCEND-PD (cross-over) \nNumber of patients   \n\nN entered 471 110 \nN in conversion 450 110 \n\nN randomised 393 91 \nN completed 368 84 \n\nFeatures of randomized patients   \nAge [yrs (SD)] 63.2 (9.4) 64.1 (9.3) \nDuration PD [yrs (SD)] 7.4 (4.5) 10.0 (5.3) \nOutcomes \nStudy arms Numient IR L-dopa† Numient LCE \n n=201 n=192 n=84 \nDose (mg), median (range) 1,330 \n\n(570; 5,390) \n800 \n\n(400; 2,000) \n1,495 \n\n(735; 4,900) \n600 \n\n(400; 1,600) \nPercentage “off” time* \nBaseline, mean 36.9% 36.0% 36.1% \nEndpoint, mean 23.8% 29.8% 24.0% 32.5% \nDifference (95% CI) -5.8% (-8.8; -2.7) -8.6% (-12.4; -4.7) \np-value < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \n“Off” time (hrs)* \nBaseline, mean  6.1  5.9 5.9 \nChange at endpoint -2.2 -1.0 -2.1 -0.7 \nDifference (95% CI) -1.0 (-1.5; -0.5) -1.4 (-2.1; -0.8) \np-value < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \n“On” time without troublesome dyskinesia (hrs)* \nBaseline, mean 10.0 10.1 9.8 \nChange at endpoint +1.9 +0.8 +1.5 +0.1 \nDifference (95% CI) 1.0 (0.5; 1.5) 1.4 (0.7; 2.0) \np-value 0.0002 < 0.0001 \nUPDRSII-III score \nBaseline, mean 32.3 32.4 32.0 \nChange at endpoint -5.7 -2.1 -2.7 -0.3 \nDifference (95% CI) -4.0 (-5.9; -2.0) -2.6 (-4.8; -0.4) \np-value < 0.0001 0.0233 \nResponder analyses \n≥1 hour improvement in “off” time (95% CI) 63.2% \n\n(56.5; 69.9) \n45.3% \n\n(38.3; 52.4) \n64.0% \n\n(54.1; 74.0) \n50.0% \n\n(39.6; 60.5) \n p-value < 0.0001 0.0094 \nCGI-C much improved (95% CI) 40.0% \n\n(33.2; 46.8) \n13.7% \n\n(8.8; 18.6) \nN/A N/A \n\n p-value < 0.0001 N/A \nAbbreviations: CGI-C: clinical global impression of change from baseline; CI: confidence interval; IR: immediate release; LCE: \nLevodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone; L-dopa†: Levodopa/Carbidopa; LS: least squares; PD: Parkinson’s disease; SD: standard deviation; N/A: not \navailable; hrs: hours; yrs: years. \n*In the ADVANCE-PD study an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model for End of Study was used with treatment and centres as main effects \nand interaction term for treatment by centre and baseline as covariate. \nData in the ASCEND-PD study were analysed using a standard mixed-model analysis of variance.

For comparable doses, Numient results in a levodopa peak concentration (Cmax) \nthat is 30% that of immediate-release levodopa/carbidopa. Following an initial peak at about one hour, \nplasma concentrations are maintained for about 4 to 5 hours before declining. Peak plasma concentrations \nare reached at about 4.5 hours. In patients with Parkinson’s disease, multiple-dose pharmacokinetics was \ncomparable to single-dose pharmacokinetics, i.e. there was a minimal accumulation of levodopa from the \nmodified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product. \n \nFollowing multiple dosing in patients, modified-release levodopa/carbidopa had reduced fluctuations in \nlevodopa plasma concentrations with peak-to-trough fluctuation index of 1.5 with minimal accumulation of \nlevodopa. \n \nCarbidopa \nFollowing oral dosing of the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product the maximum \nconcentration occurred at approximately 3.5 hours. The bioavailability of carbidopa from this medicinal \nproduct relative to immediate release levodopa and carbidopa tablets was approximately 50%. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nFood effect \n \nIn healthy adults, oral administration of the modified-release levodopa/carbidopa medicinal product after a \nhigh-fat, high-calorie meal reduced levodopa Cmax by 21%. The extent of absorption of levodopa (AUCinf) \nwas similar (13% increase) to that observed in the fasted state. Administration with a high-fat, high-calorie \nmeal delays levodopa absorption by up to 2 hours. \n \nFollowing administration of the modified-release hard capsule contents sprinkled over a small quantity of \nsoft food such as apple sauce, the rate and extent of absorption of levodopa was similar to that observed in \nthe fasted state. \n \nLevodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport, therefore high protein meals may impair the \nabsorption of levodopa.  \n \nDistribution \n \nLevodopa \nLevodopa is bound to plasma protein only to a small extent (10-30%). Levodopa crosses the blood-brain \nbarrier by active transporters for large neutral amino acids.  \n \nCarbidopa \nCarbidopa is approximately 36% bound to plasma proteins. Carbidopa does not cross the blood-brain barrier \nat clinically relevant doses.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nLevodopa \nLevodopa is extensively metabolized to various metabolites. The two major metabolic pathways are \ndecarboxylation by dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and O-methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase \n(COMT). Unchanged levodopa accounts for less than 10% of the total urinary excretion. The terminal phase \nelimination half-life of levodopa, the active moiety of antiparkinsonian activity, is approximately 2 hours in \nthe presence of carbidopa. \n \nCarbidopa \nCarbidopa is metabolized to two main metabolites: α-methyl-3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and \nα-methyl-3, 4-dihydroxy-phenylpropionic acid. These two metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine \nunchanged or as glucuronide. Unchanged carbidopa accounts for 30% of the total urinary excretion. The \nterminal phase elimination half-life of carbidopa is approximately 2 hours. \n \nDose linearity \n \nNumient shows dose proportional pharmacokinetics for both carbidopa and levodopa over the levodopa dose \nstrength range of 95 mg to 245 mg. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nRenal excretion of intact levodopa accounts for only about 10% of clearance. Thus, impaired renal function \nmay potentially have a small effect on the exposure of levodopa. Modified-release levodopa/carbidopa \nshould be administered cautiously to patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).   \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThere are no studies on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa and carbidopa in patients with hepatic impairment \n(see section 4.2). Modified-release levodopa/carbidopa should be administered cautiously to patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThere are no studies on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa and carbidopa when administered as Numient in \nchildren. \n \nElderly  \n \nIn the pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients following a single dose of Numient, systemic exposure \nto levodopa generally increased with increasing age with AUC values being, on average, approximately 15% \nhigher in elderly (≥65 years) than younger subjects (<65 years). \n \nGender \n \nLevodopa \nFollowing a single dose of Numient in patients with Parkinson’s disease the plasma AUC and Cmax of \nlevodopa was higher in females than males (on average, 37% for AUC and 35% for Cmax). These differences \nare primarily explained by the lower body weight in females. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.  \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nBoth levodopa and combinations of carbidopa and levodopa have caused visceral and skeletal malformations \nin rabbits. \n \nNo effects were seen on male or female reproductive organs in repeat dose toxicology studies in mice, rats or \nmonkeys with levodopa alone, or in combination with carbidopa. However, levodopa has been shown to \nmildly affect mating behaviour in male rats. \n \n \n6.

What Numient is and what it is used for \n \nNumient contains two different medicines called levodopa and carbidopa in one hard capsule.  \n- levodopa turns into a material called ‘dopamine’ in your brain. The dopamine helps to improve the \n\nsymptoms of your Parkinson’s disease.  \n- carbidopa belongs to a group of medicines called ‘aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitors’. It \n\nhelps levodopa work more effectively by slowing the speed at which levodopa is broken down in your \nbody.  \n \n\nNumient is used to improve the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease in adults. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Numient  \n \nDo not take Numient: \n \n- if you are allergic to levodopa or carbidopa, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6); \n- if you have narrow-angle glaucoma (an eye disorder); \n- if you have phaeochromocytoma (a rare tumour of the adrenal gland); \n- if you are taking certain medicines for treating depression [non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) \n\ninhibitors]. You need to stop using these medicines at least two weeks before you start Numient (see \nalso under ‘Other medicines and Numient’); \n\n- if you have ever had neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS –a rare severe reaction to medicines used \nto treat severe mental disorders); \n\n- if you have ever had non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis (a rare muscle disorder). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n33 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Numient if you have, have ever had, or develop: \n- sudden sleep attacks or sometimes feel very sleepy  \n- any form of severe mental disorder like psychosis \n- feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts, or notice unusual changes in your behaviour \n- tremors, agitation, confusion, fever, rapid pulse, or wide fluctuations in your blood pressure, or notice \n\nthat your muscles get very rigid or jerk violently. If any of this happens, contact your doctor \nimmediately \n\n- an eye condition called chronic wide angle glaucoma, because your dose may need to be adjusted and \nthe pressure in your eyes may need to be monitored \n\n- melanoma or suspicious skin lesion \n- a heart attack, heart beat problems, circulation or breathing problems  \n- kidney or liver problems  \n- an ulcer in your gut (called ‘duodenal’ or ‘peptic ulcer’)  \n- an endocrine (hormone) disease \n- bronchial asthma \n- obsessive behaviour(s)  \n- convulsions \n- low blood pressure or feeling dizzy when getting up \n- new or increased abnormal body movements (dyskinesias)  \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nNumient.  \n \nIf you must undergo surgery, please tell your doctor that you are using Numient. \n \nImpulse control disorders \nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in ways \nthat are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain activities \nthat could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders and can include \naddictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or an increase in sexual \nthoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your treatments. \n \nTests \nYou may need to have testing of your heart, liver, kidney, and blood cell functions during long-term \ntreatment with medicines containing levodopa/carbidopa. If you need to have tests on your blood or urine, \ntell the doctor or nurse that you are taking Numient. This is because the medicine may affect the results of \nsome tests. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThe use of Numient is not recommended in patients under 18 years of age. The safety and efficacy of \nNumient in patients under 18 years of age have not been studied \n \nOther medicines and Numient \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This \nis because other medicines can affect the way Numient works.  \n \nDo not take Numient if you have taken a medicine called a ‘non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) \ninhibitor’ for treating depression in the last 14 days. These medicines include isocarboxazid and phenelzine. \nIf this applies to you, do not take Numient and ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n34 \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking the following medicines:  \n- Other medicines for Parkinson’s disease, such as ‘anticholinergics’ (e.g. orphenadrine and \n\ntrihexyphenidyl), ‘selective MAO-B inhibitors’ (e.g. selegiline and rasagiline), and a ‘COMT \ninhibitor’ (e.g. entacapone) \n\n- Ferrous sulphate (used to treat anaemia caused by low levels of iron in the blood). \nLevodopa/carbidopa may make it harder for your body to use iron. Therefore, do not take Numient \nand iron supplements or multivitamin supplements containing iron at the same time. After taking one \nof them, wait at least 2 to 3 hours before taking the other \n\n- Phenothiazines - such as chlorpromazine, promazine and prochloroperazine (used to treat mental \nillness) \n\n- Benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, diazepam, and lorazepam used to treat anxiety \n- Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; used to treat depression) \n- Papaverine (used to improve blood flow around the body) \n- Treatment for high blood pressure (hypertension) \n- Phenytoin which is used to treat fits (convulsions) \n- Isoniazid which is used to treat tuberculosis  \n- Dopamine antagonists used to treat mental disorders, nausea, and vomiting \n \n \nNumient with food and drink  \n \nA high-fat, high-calorie meal delays the absorption of levodopa by two hours. If your diet contains too much \nprotein (meat, eggs, milk, cheese), Numient may not work as well as it should. Avoid taking your capsules at \nthe same time that you consume a high fat or high protein meal. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking Numient. \n \nNumient is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. However, your doctor may decide to give you Numient if the expected benefits of treatment \noutweigh possible risks to the unborn child.   \n \nWomen should not breast-feed during treatment with Numient. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nNumient can cause somnolence (excessive drowsiness) and sudden sleep onset episodes. Therefore, you \nmust refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put yourself or others at \nrisk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have \nresolved.  \n \n \n3.

Swallow the medicine/food \nmixture completely and immediately without chewing and do not store for future use \n\n- Take the capsules at regular time intervals according to your doctor's instructions \n- Do not change the times at which you take your capsules or take any other medicines for Parkinson's \n\ndisease without first consulting your doctor.
