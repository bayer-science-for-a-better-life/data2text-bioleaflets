CLINICAL PARTICULARS   \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPramipexole Accord is indicated in adults for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic \nParkinson\u2019s disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of \nthe disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and \nfluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or \u201con off\u201d fluctuations). \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nPosology \n \nParkinson\u2019s disease \n \nThe daily dose is administered in equally divided doses 3 times a day. \n \nInitial treatment \nDoses should be increased gradually from a starting dose of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per \nday and then increased every 5-7 days. Providing patients do not experience intolerable undesirable \neffects, the dose should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect. \n \nAscending dose schedule of Pramipexole  Accord \nWeek Dose (mg of \n\nbase) \nTotal Daily \nDose (mg of \nbase)  \n\nDose (mg of \nsalt) \n\nTotal Daily \nDose (mg of \nsalt) \n\n1 3 x 0.088 0.264 3 x 0.125 0.375 \n2 3 x 0.18 0.54 3 x 0.25 0.75 \n3 3 x 0.35 1.1 3 x 0.5 1.50 \n \nIf a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg \nof salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. \nHowever, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg \n(of salt) per day (see section 4.8). \n \nMaintenance treatment \nThe individual dose of pramipexole should be in the range of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a \nmaximum of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. During dose escalation in pivotal studies, \nefficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt). Further dose \nadjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions. In \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nclinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of \nsalt). In advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, pramipexole doses higher than 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) \nper day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended. It is \nrecommended that the dose of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the \nmaintenance treatment with Pramipexole Accord, depending on reactions in individual patients (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nTreatment discontinuation \nAbrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome. Pramipexole should be tapered off at a rate of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) \nper day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt). Thereafter the dose \nshould be reduced by 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. The following dose schedule is \nsuggested for initiation of therapy: \n \nPatients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min require no reduction in daily dose or dosing \nfrequency. \n \nIn patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/min, the initial daily dose of \nPramipexole Accord should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 \nmg of salt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/0.25 mg of salt daily). A maximum daily dose of 1.57 mg \npramipexole base (2.25 mg of salt) should not be exceeded. \n \nIn patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/min, the daily dose of Pramipexole Accord \nshould be administered in a single dose, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) daily. A \nmaximum daily dose of 1.1 mg pramipexole base (1.5 mg of salt) should not be exceeded. \n \nIf renal function declines during maintenance therapy the Pramipexole Accord daily dose should be \nreduced by the same percentage as the decline in creatinine clearance, i.e. if creatinine clearance \ndeclines by 30%, then the Pramipexole Accord daily dose should be reduced by 30%. The daily dose \ncan be administered in two divided doses if creatinine clearance is between 20 and 50 ml/min and as a \nsingle daily dose if creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx. 90% of \nabsorbed active substance is excreted through the kidneys. However, the potential influence of hepatic \ninsufficiency on Pramipexole Accord pharmacokinetics has not been investigated. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Pramipexole Accord in children below 18 years has not been established. \nThere is no relevant use of Pramipexole Accord in the paediatric population for the children of \nParkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nTourette Disorder \n \nPaediatric population \nPramipexole Accord is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years since the \nefficacy and safety has not been established in this population. Pramipexole Accord should not be \nused in children or adolescents with Tourette Disorder because of a negative benefit-risk balance for \nthis disorder (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe tablets should be taken orally, swallowed with water, and can be taken either with or without \nfood. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhen prescribing Pramipexole Accord in a patient with Parkinson\u2019s disease with renal impairment a \nreduced dose is suggested in line with section 4.2. \n \nHallucinations \n \nHallucinations are known as a side effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa. Patients \nshould be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur. \n \nDyskinesia \n \nIn advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesia can occur \nduring the initial titration of Pramipexole Accord. If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be \ndecreased. \n \nDystonia  \n\nAxial dystonia including antecollis, camptocormia and pleurothotonus (Pisa Syndrome) has \noccasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease following initiation or incremental \ndose increase of pramipexole. Although dystonia may be a symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease, the \nsymptoms in these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of pramipexole. If dystonia \noccurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and an adjustment in the dose of \npramipexole considered. \n \nSudden onset of sleep and somnolence \n \nPramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in \npatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without \nawareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly. Patients must be informed of this and \nadvised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Pramipexole \nAccord. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must \nrefrain from driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of the dose or termination of \ntherapy may be considered. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when \npatients are taking other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see \nsections 4.5, 4.7 and section 4.8). \n \nImpulse control disorders \n \nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and \ncarers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge \neating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including \nPramipexole Accord. Dose reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms \ndevelop. \n \n \nMania and delirium \n \nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of mania and delirium. Patients and carers \nshould be made aware that mania and delirium can occur in patients treated with pramipexole. Dose \nreduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \nPatients with psychotic disorders \n \nPatients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential \nbenefits outweigh the risks. Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole \nshould be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. \n \nSevere cardiovascular disease \n \nIn case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken. It is recommended to monitor blood \npressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension \nassociated with dopaminergic therapy. \n \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome \n \nSymptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal \nof dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2). \n \nDopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome \nTo discontinue treatment in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, pramipexole should be tapered off (see \nsection 4.2). Non-motor adverse effects may occur when tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists \nincluding pramipexole. Symptoms include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating and pain \nwhich may be severe. Patients should be informed about this before tapering the dopamine agonist, \nand monitored regularly thereafter. In case of persistent symptoms, it may be necessary to increase the \npramipexole dose temporarily (see section 4.8). \n \nAugmentation \n \nReports in the literature indicate that treatment of another indication  with dopaminergic medicinal \nproducts can result in augmentation. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the \nevening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other \nextremities. Augmentation was specifically investigated in a controlled clinical trial over 26 weeks. \nAugmentation was observed in 11.8% of patients in the pramipexole group (N = 152) and 9.4% of \npatients in the placebo group (N = 149). Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to augmentation showed no \nsignificant difference between pramipexole and placebo groups. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPlasma protein binding \n \nPramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is \nseen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or \nelimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by \nbiotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with \nanticholinergics has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and \nlevodopa. \n \nInhibitors/competitors of active renal elimination pathway \n \nCimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by \ninhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules. Therefore, medicinal \nproducts that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, \nsuch as cimetidine, amantadine, mexiletine, zidovudine, cisplatin, quinine, and procainamide, may \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\ninteract with pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of pramipexole. Reduction of the \npramipexole dose should be considered when these medicinal products are administered \nconcomitantly with Pramipexole Accord. \n \nCombination with levodopa \n \nWhen Pramipexole Accord is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dose of \nlevodopa is reduced and the dose of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while \nincreasing the dose of Pramipexole Accord. \n \nBecause of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other \nsedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.4, 4.7 and \n4.8). \n \nAntipsychotic medicinal products \n \nCo-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see \nsection 4.4), e.g. if antagonistic effects can be expected. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans. Pramipexole was not \nteratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). \nPramipexole Accord should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nAs pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. \nThe excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women. In rats, the \nconcentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma. \nIn the absence of human data, Pramipexole Accord should not be used during breast-feeding. \nHowever, if its use is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued. \n \nFertility \n \nNo studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted. In animal studies, pramipexole \naffected oestrous cycles and reduced female fertility as expected for a dopamine agonist. However, \nthese studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to male fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPramipexole Accord has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nHallucinations or somnolence can occur.  \n \nPatients being treated with Pramipexole Accord and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep \nepisodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness \nmay put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until such \nrecurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,923 patients on \npramipexole and 1,354 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently reported for both \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\ngroups. 63% of patients on pramipexole and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse \ndrug reaction. \n \nThe majority of adverse drug reactions usually start early in therapy and most tend to disappear even \nas therapy is continued. \n \nWithin the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of \npatients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (\u2265 1/10); \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000) ; not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nParkinson\u2019s disease, most common adverse reactions \n \nThe most commonly (\u2265 5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease more \nfrequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, \ndizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue. The incidence of \nsomnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg pramipexole salt per day (see section 4.2). A \nmore frequent adverse drug reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia. Hypotension may \noccur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nTable 1: Parkinson\u2019s disease \nBody System Very \n\ncommon \n(\u22651/10) \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to \n\n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \n\n< 1/100) \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 \n\nto \n<1/1,000) \n\nNot known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n  pneumonia   \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n  inappropriate \nantidiuretic \n hormone secretion1 \n\n  \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Insomnia \nhallucinations \nabnormal dreams  \nconfusion  \n \nbehavioural \nsymptoms of \nimpulse control \ndisorders and \ncompulsions  \n \n\ncompulsive \nshopping  \npathological \ngambling \nrestlessness \nhypersexuality \ndelusion \nlibido disorder \nparanoia \ndelirium \nbinge eating1  \nhyperphagia1  \n\nmania  \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nsomnolence \ndizziness  \ndyskinesia  \n\nheadache sudden onset of \nsleep \namnesia \nhyperkinesia \nsyncope \n\n  \n\nEye disorders  visual \nimpairment \nincluding \ndiplopia vision \nblurred  \nvisual acuity \nreduced \n\n   \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  cardiac failure1   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n hypotension    \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic, and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Dyspnoea \nhiccups \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nnausea constipation \nvomiting \n\n   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  hypersensitivity \npruritus \nrash \n\n  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n fatigue \nperipheral \noedema \n\n  Dopamine \nagonist \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \nincluding \napathy, \nanxiety, \ndepression, \nfatigue, \nsweating \nand pain. \n\nInvestigations  weight decrease \nincluding \ndecreased \nappetite \n\nweight increase   \n\n1 This side effect has been observed in post-marketing experience.

A precise frequency \nestimation is not possible as the side effect did not occur in a clinical trial database of 1,395 \npatients with other indication treated with pramipexole. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nSomnolence \n \nPramipexole is commonly associated with somnolence and has been associated uncommonly with \nexcessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (see also section 4.4). \n \nLibido disorders \n \nPramipexole may uncommonly be associated with libido disorders (increased or decreased). \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \nImpulse control disorders \n \nPathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, , compulsive spending or buying, binge \neating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including \nPramipexole Accord. (see section 4.4). \n \nIn a cross-sectional, retrospective screening and case-control study including 3,090 Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease patients, 13.6% of all patients receiving dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic treatment had \nsymptoms of an impulse control disorder during the past six months. Manifestations observed include \npathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge eating, and compulsive sexual behaviour \n(hypersexuality). Possible independent risk factors for impulse control disorders included \ndopaminergic treatments and higher doses of dopaminergic treatment, younger age ( \u2264 65 years), not \nbeing married and self-reported family history of gambling behaviours. \n \nDopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome \nNon-motor adverse effects may occur when tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists including \npramipexole. Symptoms include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating and pain (see section \n4.4). \n \nCardiac failure \n \nIn clinical studies and post-marketing experience cardiac failure has been reported in patients with \npramipexole. In a pharmacoepidemiological study pramipexole use was associated with an increased \nrisk of cardiac failure compared with non-use of pramipexole (observed risk ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-\n2.85). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no clinical experience with massive overdose. The expected adverse reactions would be those \nrelated to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, \nhyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension. There is no established antidote for overdose \nof a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent \nmay be indicated. Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with \ngastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of activated charcoal and electrocardiogram \nmonitoring. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-Parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists, ATC code: N04BC05. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D2 subfamily \nof dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D3 receptors, and has full intrinsic \nactivity.  \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nPramipexole alleviates parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the \nstriatum. Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and \nturnover. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in Parkinson\u2019s disease \n \nIn patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trials included approximately 1,800 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I \u2013 V treated \nwith pramipexole. Out of these, approximately 1,000 were in more advanced stages, received \nconcomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications. \nIn early and advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in controlled clinical trials was \nmaintained for approximately six months. In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years \nthere were no signs of decreasing efficacy. \n \nIn a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole \nsignificantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to \ninitial treatment with levodopa. This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be \nbalanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean \nchange in UPDRS-score). The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally \nhigher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group. However, there was no significant \ndifference during the maintenance phase. These points should be considered when initiating \npramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nPramipexole Accord in all subsets of the paediatric population in Parkinson\u2019s Disease (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in Tourette Disorder \n \nThe efficacy of pramipexole (0.0625-0.5 mg/day) with paediatric patients aged 6-17 years with \nTourette Disorder was evaluated in a 6-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled flexible \ndose study. A total of 63 patients were randomised (43 on pramipexole, 20 on placebo). The primary \nendpoint was change from baseline on the Total Tic Score (TTS) of the Yale Global Tic Severity \nScale (YGTSS). No difference was observed for pramipexole as compared to placebo for either the \nprimary endpoint or for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints including YGTSS total score, Patient \nGlobal Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), or \nClinical Global Impressions of Severity of Illness (CGI-S). Adverse events occurring in at least 5% of \npatients in the pramipexole group and more common in the pramipexole-treated patients than in \npatients on placebo were: headache (27.9%, placebo 25.0%), somnolence (7.0%, placebo 5.0%), \nnausea (18.6%, placebo 10.0%), vomiting (11.6%, placebo 0.0%), upper abdominal pain (7.0%, \nplacebo 5.0%), orthostatic hypotension (9.3%, placebo 5.0%), myalgia (9.3%, placebo 5.0%), sleep \ndisorder (7.0%, placebo 0.0%), dyspnoea (7.0%, placebo 0.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection \n(7.0%, placebo 5.0%). Other significant adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication \nfor patients receiving pramipexole were confusional state, speech disorder and aggravated condition \n(see section 4.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nPramipexole is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration. The absolute \nbioavailability is greater than 90% and the maximum plasma concentrations occur between 1 and 3 \nhours. Concomitant administration with food did not reduce the extent of pramipexole absorption, but \nthe rate of absorption was reduced. Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient \nvariation of plasma levels. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is \nlarge (400 l). High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx. 8-fold compared to \nplasma). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent. \n \nElimination \n \nRenal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination. Approximately 90% of \n14C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces. The total \nclearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/min and the renal clearance is approximately 400 \nml/min. The elimination half-life (t\u00bd) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving \nthe CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated \npharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole. \n \nDecreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the minipig, and a tendency \nto a hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey. \n \nThe potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and \nrabbits. Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at \nmaternally toxic doses. Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, \nthe adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated. \n \nA delay in sexual development (i.e., preputial separation and vaginal opening) was observed in rats. \nThe relevance for humans is unknown. \n \nPramipexole was not genotoxic. In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell \nhyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole. This finding is \nnot clinically relevant to man. The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/kg (of salt) and \nhigher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats. The latter finding was not \nobserved in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species \ninvestigated. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Pramipexole Accord is and what it is used for \n \nPramipexole Accord contains the active substance pramipexole and belongs to a group of medicines \nknown as dopamine agonists, which stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain. Stimulation of the \ndopamine receptors triggers nerve impulses in the brain that help to control body movements. \n \nPramipexole Accord is used to: \n\uf0b7 treat the symptoms of primary Parkinson\u2019s disease in adults. It can be used alone or in \n\ncombination with levodopa (another medicine for Parkinson\u2019s disease). \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before you take Pramipexole Accord  \n \nDo not take Pramipexole Accord: \n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to pramipexole or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions: \nTalk to your doctor before taking Pramipexole Accord. Tell your doctor if you have (had) or develop \nany medical conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following: \n\uf0b7 Kidney disease. \n\uf0b7 Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). Most hallucinations are \n\nvisual. \n\uf0b7 Dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs). If you have advanced \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the up-\ntitration of Pramipexole Accord. \n\n\uf0b7 Dystonia \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n\uf0b7 Inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia). In particular, you \nmay experience forward flexion of the head and neck (also called antecollis), forward bending \nof the lower back (also called camptocormia) or sidewards bending of the back (also called \npleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome). If this happens, your doctor may want to change your \nmedication. \n\n\uf0b7 Sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep. \n\uf0b7 Psychosis (e.g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia). \n\uf0b7 Vision impairment. You should have regular eye examinations during treatment with \n\nPramipexole Accord. \n\uf0b7 Severe heart or blood vessels disease.
