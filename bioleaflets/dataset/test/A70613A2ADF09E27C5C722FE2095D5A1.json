NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMacugen 0.3 mg solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne pre-filled syringe provides a usable amount to deliver a single dose of 90 microlitres containing \npegaptanib sodium, corresponding to 0.3 mg of the free acid form of the oligonucleotide. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \nThe solution is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMacugen is indicated for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) \nin adults (see section 5.1). \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nMacugen should only be administered by ophthalmologists experienced in intravitreal injections. \n \nPosology \nThe patient\u2019s medical history for hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to \nperforming the intravitreal procedure (see section 4.4). \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.3 mg pegaptanib, equivalent to 90 microliters, administered once every \nsix weeks (9 injections per year) by intravitreal injection into the affected eye. \n \nFollowing the injection, transient increases in intraocular pressure were seen in Macugen treated \npatients. Therefore, the perfusion of the optic nerve head and intraocular pressure should be \nmonitored. Moreover patients should be closely monitored for vitreous haemorrhage and \nendophthalmitis in the two weeks following the injection. Patients should be instructed to report any \nsymptoms suggestive of these conditions without delay (see section 4.4). \n \nAfter 2 consecutive injections of Macugen, if a patient does not demonstrate a treatment benefit (loss \nof less than 15 letters of visual acuity) at the 12-week visit, consideration should be given to stopping \nor withholding Macugen therapy. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo special considerations are needed. \n \nHepatic impairment \nMacugen has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. \nHowever, no special considerations are needed in this population (see section 5.2) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 3\n\n \nRenal impairment \nMacugen has not been adequately studied in patients with severe renal impairment. Dose adjustments \nare not recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Macugen in children under 18 years has not yet been established. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor intravitreal injection use only. \n \nMacugen should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration \n(see section 6.6). \n \nThe injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the use of \nsurgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent) \nand the availability of sterile paracentesis (if required). Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum \ntopical microbicide should be administered prior to the injection.  \n \nThe pre-filled syringe is supplied with an excess product volume. Injecting the entire volume of the \nprefilled syringe could result in overdose (see section 4.8 and 4.9). See section 6.6 for instructions to \nexpel the excess volume before injection. \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nActive or suspected ocular or periocular infection.  \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nEndophtalmitis \nIntravitreal injection procedures are associated with a risk of endophthalmitis; in Macugen clinical \ntrials, the incidence of endophthalmitis was 0.1% per injection (see section 4.2). \n \nIncreased intraocular pressure \nAs expected with intravitreal injections, transient increases in intraocular pressure may be seen.  \nTherefore, the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be verified and elevation of intraocular \npressure should be managed appropriately post injection.  \n \nA post marketing observational study has also reported on a small risk of slow sustained increase in \nintraocular pressure (see section 4.8). \n \nIntravitreous haemorrhages \nImmediate (on the day of injection) and delayed intravitreous haemorrhages may occur following \npegaptanib injections (see section 4.2). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nCases of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema, have been observed within \nseveral hours after the pegaptanib intravitreal administration procedure in the post-marketing \nexperience. A direct relationship to Macugen or any of the various treatments administered as part of \nthe injection preparation procedure, or to other factors has not been established in these cases. \n \nSystemic effects  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 4\n\nSystemic adverse events including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events have \nbeen reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and there is a theoretical risk that \nthese may relate to VEGF inhibition. There are limited data on safety in patients with prior history of \nstroke or transient ischaemic attacks. Caution should be exercised when treating such patients (see \nsection 4.8, heading \u2018Product-class-related adverse reactions\u2019). \n \nOverfill volume \nInjection of the entire volume of the pre-filled syringe could result in serious adverse events; therefore, \nthe excess volume must be expelled before injection (see sections 4.8 and 6.6). \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDrug interaction studies have not been conducted with Macugen. Pegaptanib is metabolised by \nnucleases and therefore cytochrome P450 mediated drug interactions are unlikely. \n \nTwo early clinical studies conducted in patients who received Macugen alone and in combination with \nPDT (photodynamic therapy) revealed no apparent difference in the plasma pharmacokinetics of \npegaptanib.  \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nPegaptanib has not been studied in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient, but have shown \nreproductive toxicity at high systemic exposure levels (see section 5.3). The potential risk to humans is \nunknown. The systemic exposure to pegaptanib is expected to be very low after ocular administration. \nNevertheless, Macugen should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother \njustifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Macugen is excreted in human milk. Macugen is not recommended during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nNo human data on the effect of Macugen on fertility are available. In animal studies no effects on male \nor female fertility in mice were observed. See section 5.3. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMacugen has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to the possible temporary \nvisual blurring after administration of Macugen by intravitreal injection. Patients should be instructed \nnot to drive or use machines until this has resolved. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe majority of adverse reactions reported following administration of Macugen are related to the \nintravitreal injection procedure. \n \nIn clinical trials the most frequently reported ocular adverse reactions following injection of Macugen \nare: anterior chamber inflammation, eye pain, increased intraocular pressure, punctate keratitis, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 5\n\nvitreous floaters and vitreous opacities. Less frequently reported serious ocular adverse reactions \nincluded endophthalmitis, retinal haemorrhage, vitreous haemorrhage  and retinal detachment.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe safety data described below summarise all procedure and adverse reactions in the 295 patients in \nthe 0.3 mg treatment group. The adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), and not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nReports from post-marketing experience are included in italics. \n  \n\nMedDRA system organ class Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders  \nNot known anaphylactic reaction* \n\n  \nPsychiatric disorders  \nUncommon nightmare, depression \n  \nNervous system disorders  \nCommon headache \n  \nEye disorders  \nVery common anterior chamber inflammation, eye pain, increased \n\nintraocular pressure, punctate keratitis, vitreous floaters and \nvitreous opacities \n\nCommon abnormal sensation in eye, cataract, conjunctival \nhaemorrhage, conjunctival hyperaemia, conjunctival \noedema, conjunctivitis, corneal dystrophy, corneal \nepithelium defect, corneal epithelium disorder, corneal \noedema, dry eye, endophthalmitis, eye discharge, eye \ninflammation, eye irritation, eye pruritus, eye redness, eye \nswelling, eyelid oedema, lacrimation increased, macular \ndegeneration, mydriasis, ocular discomfort, ocular \nhypertension, periorbital haematoma, photophobia, \nphotopsia,  retinal haemorrhage, vision blurred, visual acuity \nreduced, visual disturbance, vitreous detachment, and \nvitreous disorder \n\nUncommon asthenopia, blepharitis, conjunctivitis allergic, corneal \ndeposits, eye haemorrhage, eyelids pruritus, keratitis, \nvitreous haemorrhage, pupillary reflex impaired, corneal \nabrasion, retinal exudates, eyelid ptosis, retinal scar, \nchalazion, corneal erosion, decreased intraocular pressure, \ninjection site reaction, injection site vesicles,  retinal \ndetachment, corneal disorder, retinal artery occlusion, retinal \ntear, ectropion, eye movement disorder, eyelid irritation, \nhyphaema, pupillary disorder, iris disorder, ocular icterus, \nanterior uveitis, deposit eye, iritis, optic nerve cupping, \npupillary deformity, retinal vein occlusion, and vitreous \nprolapse \n\n  \nEar and labyrinth disorders  \nUncommon deafness, Meniere's disease aggravated, vertigo \n  \nCardiac disorders  \nUncommon palpitations \n  \nVascular disorders  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 6\n\nUncommon hypertension, aortic aneurysm \n  \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n \n\nCommon rhinorrhea \nUncommon nasopharyngitis \n  \nGastrointestinal disorders  \nUncommon vomiting, dyspepsia \n  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n \n\nUncommon contact dermatitis, eczema, hair colour changes, rash, \npruritus, night sweats \n\nNot known angioedema* \n  \nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\n \n\nUncommon back pain \n  \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n \n\nUncommon fatigue, rigors, tenderness, chest pain, influenza like illness \n  \nInvestigations  \nUncommon increased gamma-glutamyltransferase activity \n  \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications \n\n \n\nUncommon abrasion \n  \n \n* Post-marketing experience; see \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nCases of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema, have been reported in patients \nwithin several hours after administration of pegaptanib along with various medicinal products \nadministered as part of the injection preparation procedure (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nCases of serious increase in intraocular pressure have been reported when the excess volume in the \npre-filled syringe was not expelled before injection. \n \nSustained small increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have also been reported after repeated \nintravitreal dosing in a post marketing observational study. The odds of increased IOP was increased \nby a factor of 1.128 for each additional injection (p= 0.0003). No statistical difference was found in \nthe incidence of increased IOP between patients with a history of increased IOP or glaucoma versus \npatients without. \n \nProduct-class-related adverse reactions  \nIn the clinical trial, the overall frequency of non-ocular haemorrhages, an adverse event potentially \nrelated to systemic VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibition, was slightly increased in \nintravitreal VEGF inhibitor-treated patients. However, there was no consistent pattern among the \ndifferent haemorrhages. Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) are adverse events potentially related \nto systemic VEGF inhibition. There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic including stroke \nand myocardial infarction events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 7\n\nA few cases of arterial thromboembolic events were observed in the pegaptanib clinical trials in \npatients with AMD, DME, and there were no major differences between the groups treated with \npegaptanib compared to control. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose with Macugen has not been reported in clinical trials.  \n \nOverdosing with increased injection volume (e.g. when the excess volume in the pre-filled syringe is \nnot expelled before injection) may elevate intraocular pressure (see section 4.8). Treating physician \nshould always expel excess volume of solution according to instructions under the section 6.6. \nTherefore, in case of overdose, intraocular pressure should be monitored and if deemed necessary by \nthe treating physician, adequate treatment should be initiated. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, Ocular vascular disorder agents, ATC Code \nS01LA03. \n \nMechanism of action \nPegaptanib is a pegylated modified oligonucleotide that binds with high specificity and affinity to \nextracellular Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF165) inhibiting its activity. VEGF is a secreted \nprotein that induces angiogenesis, vascular permeability and inflammation, all of which are thought to \ncontribute to the progression of the neovascular (wet) form of AMD.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nVEGF165 is the VEGF isoform preferentially involved in pathological ocular neovascularisation. The \nselective inhibition in animals with pegaptanib proved as effective at suppressing pathological \nneovascularisation as pan-VEGF inhibition, however pegaptanib spared the normal vasculature \nwhereas pan-VEGF inhibition did not. \n \nReductions in the growth of mean total lesion size, choroidal neovascularisation (CNV size), and \nfluorescein leak size, have been shown in patients with AMD treated with Macugen. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nPegaptanib was studied in two controlled, double-masked, and identically designed randomised \nstudies (EOP1003; EOP1004) in patients with neovascular AMD. A total of 1190 patients were treated \n(892 pegaptanib, 298 sham (control)) with a median age of 77 years. Patients received a mean of \nbetween 8.4-8.6 treatments out of possible 9 total across all treatment arms in the first year.  \n \nPatients were randomised to receive sham or 0.3 mg, 1 mg or 3 mg pegaptanib administered as \nintravitreal injections every 6 weeks for 48 weeks. Verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) was \npermitted in patients with predominantly classic lesions at the discretion of the investigators.  \n \nThe two trials enrolled patients, including all neovascular AMD lesion subtypes (25% predominantly \nclassic, 39% occult with no classic and 36% minimally classic), lesion sizes up to 12 disc areas, of \nwhich up to 50% could be comprised of subretinal haemorrhage and/or up to 25% fibrotic scar or \natrophic damage. Patients had up to one prior PDT and baseline visual acuity in the study eye between \n20/40 and 20/320.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 8\n\n \nAt one year, pegaptanib 0.3 mg exhibited a statistically significant treatment benefit for the primary \nefficacy endpoint; proportion of patients losing less than 15 letters of visual acuity (prespecified \npooled analysis, pegaptanib 0.3 mg 70% versus Sham 55%, p = 0.0001; EOP1003 pegaptanib 0.3 mg \n73% versus Sham 59%, p = 0.0105; EOP1004 pegaptanib 0.3 mg 67% versus Sham 52%, p = 0.0031).  \n \n \n \n \n\nMean Change in Visual Acuity Over Time; Year 1; ITT (LOCF) \n\nWeeks \nN: number of patients enrolled \n\n \nPegaptanib 0.3 mg showed treatment benefit regardless of baseline lesion subtype, lesion size and \nvisual acuity as well as age, gender, iris pigmentation and prior and/or baseline PDT usage.  \n \nAt the end of the first year (week 54), 1053 patients were re-randomized to either continue or \ndiscontinue treatment through week 102. \n \nOn average, the treatment benefit was maintained at 102 weeks with continuing preservation of visual \nacuity for patients re-randomized to continue pegaptanib. Patients who were re-randomized to \ndiscontinue pegaptanib after one year, lost visual acuity during the second year. \n \nSummary of Mean Changes in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Weeks 6, 12, 54 and 102 (LOCF) \n\n EOP 1003 EOP 1004 \n\n 0.3-0.3 0.3-discontinued \n\nSham-\nsham/sham+ \ndiscontinued\n\n0.3-0.3          0.3- discontinued \n\nSham-\nsham/sham+ \ndiscontinued \n\nN      67 66 54 66 66           53 \nMean change \nin VA Week \n\n 6 \n   -1.9 -0.0 -4.4 -1.9 -2.0         -3.4 \n\nMean change \nin VA Week \n\n12 \n\n \n   -4.3 \n\n \n-2.0 \n\n \n-4.8 \n\n \n-2.8 \n\n \n-2.2 \n\n \n        -4.7 \n\nMean change \nin VA Week \n\n54 \n\n \n  -9.6 \n\n \n-4.3 \n\n \n-11.7 \n\n \n-8.0 \n\n \n-7.6 \n\n \n       -15.6 \n\nMean change \nin VA Week \n\n102 \n -10.8 -9.7 \n\n \n-13.1 -8.0 -12.7 \n\n \n       -21.1 \n\n \n\nM\nea\n\nn \nC\n\nha\nng\n\ne \nin\n\n V\nA\n\n  \nfr\n\nom\n W\n\nee\nk \n\n0 \n(L\n\net\nte\n\nrs\n)  \n\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n\n0.3 mg N=265\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 9\n\nData over a two-year period indicate that Macugen treatment should be initiated as early as possible. \nIn advanced disease the initiation and continuation of Macugen therapy should consider the potential \nfor useful vision in the eye. \n \nMacugen therapy administered to both eyes concurrently has not been studied. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Macugen beyond two years has not been demonstrated. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMacugen in all subsets of the paediatric population in age-related macular degeneration. See section \n4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption: \nIn animals, pegaptanib is slowly absorbed into the systemic circulation from the eye after intravitreal \nadministration.  The rate of absorption from the eye is the rate-limiting step in the disposition of \npegaptanib in animals and is likely to be in humans.  In humans, the average \u00b1 standard deviation \napparent plasma half-life of pegaptanib after a 3 mg (10-times the recommended dose) monocular \ndose is 10 \u00b1 4 days. \n \nA mean maximum plasma concentration of about 80 ng/ml occurs within 1 to 4 days after a 3 mg \nmonocular dose in humans. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) is about \n25 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/ml at this dose. Pegaptanib does not accumulate in the plasma when administered \nintravitreally every 6 weeks. At doses below 0.5 mg/eye, pegaptanib plasma concentrations do not \nlikely exceed 10 ng/ml. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of pegaptanib after intravitreal administration has not been assessed in \nhumans, but is approximately 70-100% in rabbits, dogs and monkeys. \n \nIn animals that received doses of pegaptanib up to 0.5 mg/eye to both eyes, plasma concentrations \nwere 0.03% to 0.15% of those in the vitreous humour. \n \nDistribution, biotransformation and elimination: \nIn mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys, pegaptanib distributes primarily into plasma volume and is \nnot extensively distributed to peripheral tissues after intravenous administration. Twenty-four hours \nafter intravitreous administration of a radiolabeled dose of pegaptanib to both eyes of rabbits, \nradioactivity was mainly distributed in vitreous humour, retina and aqueous humour. After intravitreal \nand intravenous administrations of radiolabeled pegaptanib to rabbits, the highest concentrations of \nradioactivity (excluding the eye for the intravitreal dose) were obtained in the kidney. In rabbits, the \ncomponent nucleotide, 2\u2019-fluorouridine is found in plasma and urine after single radiolabeled \npegaptanib intravenous and intravitreal doses. Pegaptanib is metabolised by endo- and exonucleases. \nIn rabbits, pegaptanib is eliminated as parent drug and metabolites primarily in the urine. \n \nSpecial populations:  \nPegaptanib pharmacokinetics is similar in female and male patients and within the age range 50 to \n90 years. \n \nPegaptanib sodium has not been adequately studied in patients with creatinine clearance below \n20 ml/min. A decrease in creatinine clearance down to 20 ml/min may be associated with up to a \n2.3-fold increase in pegaptanib AUC. No special considerations are needed in patients with creatinine \nclearance above 20 ml/min who are treated with the recommended dose of pegaptanib sodium 0.3 mg.  \n \nPegaptanib pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. The systemic \nexposure is expected to be within a well tolerated range in patients with hepatic impairment, as a 10 \nfold higher dose (3 mg/eye) was well tolerated. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 10\n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. There are no studies on the carcinogenic \npotential of pegaptanib. \n \nPegaptanib produced no maternal toxicity and no evidence of teratogenicity or foetal mortality in mice \nat intravenous doses of 1 to 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight (5%) and minimal delayed \nossification in forepaw phalanges were observed, only at exposure levels based on AUC of over 300 \nfold greater than that expected in humans. These finding are therefore considered to be of limited \nclinical relevance. In the 40 mg/kg/day group, pegaptanib concentrations in the amniotic fluid were \n0.05% of the maternal plasma levels. There are no reproductive toxicity studies in rabbits. \nNo data are available to evaluate male or female mating or fertility indices. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1. What Macugen is and what it is used for \n2.

What Macugen is and what it is used for \n \nMacugen is a solution which is injected into the eye. Pegaptanib, the active substance of this medicine, \ninhibits the activity of the factor involved in the abnormal formation of new blood vessels in the eye, \nknown as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor165 (VEGF165). \n \nMacugen is used for the treatment of the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This \ndisease leads to vision loss resulting from damage to the central part of the retina (called the macula), \nat the back of the eye. The macula enables the eye to provide the fine central vision that is needed for \nactivities such as driving a car, reading fine print and other similar tasks.  \n \nIn the wet form of AMD, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina and macula. These new blood \nvessels may bleed and leak fluid, causing the macula to bulge or lift up, thus distorting or destroying \ncentral vision. Under these circumstances vision loss may be rapid and severe. Macugen works by \ninhibiting the growth of these abnormal blood vessels and by stemming the bleeding and leakage. The \nmedicine is used for the treatment of all types of abnormal blood vessels growth in adult AMD \npatients. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Macugen \n \nYou must not be given Macugen: \nIf you are allergic to pegaptanib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \nIf you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Macugen. \n \nOccasionally, an infection or bleeding in the eye can occur after Macugen injection (in the next two \nweeks). It is important to identify and treat these types of conditions as soon as possible. Please tell \nyour doctor immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms: eye pain or increased \ndiscomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, increased sensitivity to light, increased \nnumber of small particles in your vision. If your doctor cannot be reached for any reason, an alternate \ndoctor should be contacted immediately. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 24\n\nIn some patients the pressure inside the treated eye may increase for a short period directly after the \ninjection. Your doctor may monitor this after each injection. \n \nSoon after the injection serious allergic reactions may occur. The symptoms you might experience and \nthe instruction what to do in such cases are described in section 4 of this leaflet.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nMacugen should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Macugen \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before Macugen treatment. \n \n\uf0b7 There is no experience of using Macugen in pregnant women. Macugen should not be used during \n\npregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child. If you are \npregnant discuss this with your doctor before treatment with Macugen. \n\n\uf0b7 Macugen is not recommended during breastfeeding as it is not known whether Macugen passes \ninto human milk.  Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before starting Macugen treatment. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may experience temporary visual blurring after receiving Macugen. If you are affected, do not \ndrive or use machines until this resolves. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Macugen \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 90 microlitre dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019 (see section 6). \n \n3. How you will be given Macugen \n \nAll injections of Macugen will be administered by your doctor. \n \nMacugen is administered as a single injection (0.3 mg) into your eye at intervals of 6 weeks (i.e. \n9 times per year). The injection is given into the vitreous of the eye, which is the jelly-like substance \ninside the eye. Your doctor will monitor your condition and recommend how long you should be \ntreated with Macugen. \n \nBefore the treatment is given your doctor may ask you to use antibiotic eye drops, or to wash your \neyes carefully. Your doctor will also give you some local anaesthetic (numbing medicine). This will \nreduce or prevent any pain you might have with the injection. \nPlease do not forget to tell your doctor if you are known to be allergic to any substance.  \n \nAfter each injection you might be asked to use antibiotic eye drops (or another type of antibiotic \ntreatment) to guard against eye infection. \n \nIf you have been given more Macugen than you should have \nIn the case excess Macugen volume is injected, serious increase in intraocular pressure may occur. \nWhenever you\u2019ll experience vision disturbances, eye discomfort/pain, eye redness or nausea and \nvomiting, immediately refer to your doctor and tell about your symptoms. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Please seek immediate \nmedical help if you experience any of the following soon after the injection: sudden onset of breathing \ndifficulty or wheezing, swollen mouth, face, hands or feet, itching skin, fainting, rapid pulse, stomach \ncramps, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. Frequency of these side effects cannot be estimated from the \ndata available. \n \nUncommonly, an infection in the internal portion of the eye can occur after two weeks following \nMacugen treatment. The symptoms you might experience are described in section 2 of this leaflet \n(\"Warnings and precautions\"). Please read section 2. It tells you what to do if you have any of these \nsymptoms. \n \nOther possible side effects are as follows: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n \nThese side effects are most probably caused by the injection procedure rather than the medicine, and \ninclude:  \n\n\uf0b7 eye inflammation  \n\uf0b7 eye pain  \n\uf0b7 increased pressure inside the eye  \n\uf0b7 small marks on the eye surface (punctate keratitis)  \n\uf0b7 small particles or spots in your vision (vitreous floaters or opacities). \n\n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n \nOther common eye side effects reported to be possibly caused by the medicine or by the injection \nprocedure include:  \n\n\uf0b7 blurred vision  \n\uf0b7 visual disturbance  \n\uf0b7 eye discomfort  \n\uf0b7 decreased vision \n\uf0b7 increased sensitivity to light, appearance of flashing lights  \n\uf0b7 bleeding that occurs around the eye (periorbital bleeding)  \n\uf0b7 bloodshot eye (conjunctival haemorrhage)  \n\uf0b7 disorder of the jelly portion inside the eye (vitreous disorder), such as displacement or tear \n\n(vitreous detachment)  \n\uf0b7 clouding of the lens (cataract)  \n\uf0b7 disorder of the surface of the eye (cornea)  \n\uf0b7 swelling or inflammation of the eyelid, swelling of the area on the inside of the eyelid or the \n\nouter surface of the eye (conjunctiva)  \n\uf0b7 eye inflammation, tears, inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis), dryness, eye \n\ndischarge, eye irritation, itching of the eye, eye redness or enlargement of the pupil  \n \nOther common non-visual side effects reported to be possibly caused by the medicine or by the \ninjection procedure include: \n\n\uf0b7 headache \n\uf0b7 nasal discharge. \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n \nUncommon eye side effects reported to be possibly caused by the medicine or by the injection \nprocedure include:  \n\n\uf0b7 inflammation of your eye or of the outer surface of the eye  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n 26\n\n\uf0b7 bleeding in the eye or the internal portion of the eye (vitreous)  \n\uf0b7 eye strain \n\uf0b7 inflammation of the central part of the surface of the eye (keratitis)  \n\uf0b7 small deposits on the eye or on the surface of the eye (cornea), deposits in the back of the eye,  \n\uf0b7 itching of the eyelids  \n\uf0b7 disturbance in your eye\u2019s reaction to the light (pupillary reflex impaired)  \n\uf0b7 small erosion on the central part of the surface of the eye (cornea)  \n\uf0b7 drooping eyelid  \n\uf0b7 scar inside the eye (retinal scar)  \n\uf0b7 small lump on your eyelid due to inflammation (chalazion)  \n\uf0b7 decreased pressure inside the eye  \n\uf0b7 injection site reaction, injection site vesicles  \n\uf0b7 displacement or tear of a layer in the back of the eye (retina)  \n\uf0b7 disorder of the pupil, of the coloured part of the eye (iris)  \n\uf0b7 retinal artery occlusion  \n\uf0b7 eversion of the eyelid, eye movement disorder, eyelid irritation  \n\uf0b7 blood in your eye, discoloured eye, deposit  eye  \n\uf0b7 inflammation of the eye (iritis)  \n\uf0b7 optic nerve cupping  \n\uf0b7 deformation of the pupil  \n\uf0b7 occlusion of the vein at the back of the eye  \n\uf0b7 discharge of inner jelly of the eye \n\n \nUncommon non-visual side effects reported to be possibly caused by the medicine or by the injection \nprocedure include:  \n\n\uf0b7 nightmare, depression, deafness, vertigo \n\uf0b7 palpitations, high blood pressure, dilatation of the aorta (the main blood vessel)  \n\uf0b7 inflammation of the higher respiratory tract, vomiting, indigestion  \n\uf0b7 irritation and inflammation of the skin, hair colour changes, rash, itching,  \n\uf0b7 night sweats, back pain, tiredness, shivering, tenderness, chest pain, sudden fever and flu-like \n\nsymptoms (generalised aches and pains) \n\uf0b7 elevation of the liver enzymes, abrasion. \n\n \n \nThere is a small risk of a slight lasting increased pressure inside the eye after repeated injection in the \neye. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor , pharmacist or nurse.

this medicine, inhibits the activity of the factor involved in the abnormal formation of new blood vessels in the eye, known as vascular endothelial growth factor165 (vegf165). macugen is used for the treatment of the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (amd). this disease leads to vision loss resulting from damage to the central part of the retina (called the macula), at the back of the eye. the macula enables the eye to provide the fine central vision that is needed for activities such as driving a car, reading fine print and other similar tasks. in the wet form of amd, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina and macula. these new blood vessels may bleed and leak fluid, causing the macula to bulge or lift up, thus distorting or destroying central vision. under these circumstances vision loss may be rapid and severe. macugen works by inhibiting the growth of these abnormal blood vessels and by stemming the bleeding and leakage. the medicine is used for the treatment of all types of abnormal blood vessels growth in adult amd patients.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "macugen", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "a
