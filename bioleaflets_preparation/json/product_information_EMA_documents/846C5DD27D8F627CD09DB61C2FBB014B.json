NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZoledronic acid medac 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne bottle with 100 ml solution contains 4 mg zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). \n \nOne ml solution contains 0.04 mg zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for infusion \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n- Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or \n\nsurgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced \nmalignancies involving bone. \n\n \n- Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nZoledronic acid medac must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare \nprofessionals experienced in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients treated with \nZoledronic acid medac should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. \n \nPosology \n \nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone \nAdults and elderly people \nThe recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced \nmalignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks.  \n \nPatients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D \ndaily.  \n \nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. \n \nTreatment of TIH \nAdults and elderly people \nThe recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium ≥ 12.0 mg/dl or \n3.0 mmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid.  \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nRenal impairment \nTIH: \nZoledronic acid treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be considered \nonly after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum \ncreatinine > 400 µmol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is necessary in TIH \npatients with serum creatinine < 400 µmol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). \n \nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone: \nWhen initiating treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone \nlesions from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. \nCLcr is calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Zoledronic acid is not \nrecommended for patients presenting with severe renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which \nis defined for this population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials with zoledronic acid, patients with \nserum creatinine > 265 µmol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded. \n \nFor patients with normal renal function (defined as CLcr > 60 ml/min), zoledronic acid 4 mg/100 ml \nsolution for infusion may be administered directly without any further preparation. In patients with \nbone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, \nwhich is defined for this population as CLcr 30 – 60 ml/min, the following zoledronic acid dose is \nrecommended (see also section 4.4): \n \nBaseline creatinine clearance (ml/min) Zoledronic acid recommended dose* \n> 60 4.0 mg \n50 – 60 3.5 mg* \n40 – 49 3.3 mg* \n30 – 39 3.0 mg* \n*Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg•hr/l) (CLcr=75 ml/min). The reduced \ndoses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in patients \nwith creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. \n \nFollowing initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of zoledronic \nacid and treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, renal \ndeterioration was defined as follows: \n− For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or 124 µmol/l), an increase of \n\n0.5 mg/dl or 44 µmol/l; \n− For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 µmol/l), an increase of \n\n1.0 mg/dl or 88 µmol/l. \n \nIn the clinical studies, zoledronic acid treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned \nto within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zoledronic acid treatment should be resumed at \nthe same dose as that prior to treatment interruption. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration  \nIntravenous use.  \nZoledronic acid medac 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion should be given as a single intravenous \ninfusion in no less than 15 minutes. \n \nIn patients with normal renal function, defined as CLcr > 60 ml/min, zoledronic acid 4 mg/100 ml \nsolution for infusion must not be further diluted.  \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced Zoledronic acid medac 4 mg/100 ml \nsolution for infusion doses are recommended (see section “Posology” above and section 4.4). \n \nTo prepare reduced doses for patients with baseline CLcr ≤ 60 ml/min, refer to Table 1 below. \nRemove the volume of Zoledronic acid medac 4 mg/100 ml solution indicated from the bottle and \nreplace with an equal volume of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, or 5% \nglucose. \n \nTable 1: Preparation of reduced doses of Zoledronic acid medac 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion \n \n\nBaseline creatinine \nclearance (ml/min)  \n\nRemove the following \namount of Zoledronic \nacid medac solution for \ninfusion (ml)  \n\nReplace with the \nfollowing volume of \nsterile sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%), or 5% \nglucose solution for \ninjection (ml)  \n\nAdjusted dose (mg \nzoledronic acid in \n100 ml)  \n\n50-60 12.0 12.0 3.5 \n40-49 18.0 18.0 3.3 \n30-39 25.0 25.0 3.0 \n\n \nZoledronic acid medac 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion must not be mixed with other infusion \nsolutions and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line.  \n \nPatients must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of zoledronic acid. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1. \n• Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nPatients must be assessed prior to administration of zoledronic acid to ensure that they are adequately \nhydrated.  \n \nOverhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. \n \nStandard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate \nand magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating zoledronic acid therapy. If \nhypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy \nmay be necessary. Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function \nimpairment, therefore careful renal function monitoring should be considered.  \n \nOther medicinal products containing zoledronic acid as active substances are available for \nosteoporosis indications and treatment of Paget´s disease of the bone. Patients being treated with \nZoledronic acid medac should not be treated with such medicinal products concomitantly or any other \nbisphosphonate, since the combined effects of these agents are unknown. \n \nRenal insufficiency \nPatients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated \nwith consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with zoledronic acid \noutweighs the possible risk. \n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2 – 3 months. \n \nZoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. Factors that may increase the \npotential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, \nmultiple cycles of zoledronic acid 4 mg and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic \nmedicinal products. While the risk is reduced with a dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over \n15 minutes, deterioration in renal function may still occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal \nfailure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg \nzoledronic acid. Increases in serum creatinine also occur in some patients with chronic administration \nof zoledronic acid at recommended doses for prevention of skeletal related events, although less \nfrequently. \n \nPatients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of zoledronic acid. Upon \ninitiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, lower \ndoses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal deterioration \nduring treatment, zoledronic acid should be withheld. Zoledronic acid should only be resumed when \nserum creatinine returns to within 10 % of baseline. Zoledronic acid medac treatment should be \nresumed at the same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. \n \nIn view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in \npatients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine ≥ 400 µmol/l or \n≥ 4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and ≥ 265 µmol/l or ≥ 3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and bone \nmetastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe \nrenal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of zoledronic acid is not \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nHepatic insufficiency \nAs only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific \nrecommendations can be given for this patient population. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials and in the post-\nmarketing setting in patients receiving zoledronic acid.  \n \nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth except in medical emergency situations. \n \nA dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment \nis recommended prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors.  \n \nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual’s risk of developing \nONJ:  \n\n• Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of \nadministration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of \nbisphosphonate. \n\n• Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n• Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy \n\nto neck and head, corticosteroids. \n• History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures \n\n(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures. \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with Zoledronic acid medac. While on treatment, invasive dental \nprocedures should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to \nzoledronic acid administration.  \nFor patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery \nmay exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to \nsuggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the \njaw. \n \nThe management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between \nthe treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of \nzoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \nfactors are mitigated where possible. \n \nOsteonecrosis of other anatomical sites \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n \nAdditionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and \nfemur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with Zoledronic acid medac. \n \nMusculoskeletal pain \nIn post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain \nhave been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. However, such \nreports have been infrequent. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months \nafter starting treatment. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. A subset had \nrecurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur  \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n \nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n \nHypocalcaemia \nHypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Cardiac arrhythmias and \nneurologic adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported \nsecondary to cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation \nhave been reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8). \nCaution is advised when zoledronic acid is administered with medicinal products known to cause \nhypocalcaemia, as they may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section \n4.5). Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating \nzoledronic acid therapy. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n \nSodium \nZoledronic acid medac contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn clinical studies, zoledronic acid has been administered concomitantly with commonly used \nanticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions \noccurring. Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit \nhuman P450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been \nperformed.  \n \nCaution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop \ndiuretics, since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for \nlonger periods than required (see section 4.4). \n \nCaution is indicated when zoledronic acid is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal \nproducts. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during \ntreatment. \n \nIn multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when zoledronic acid is \nused in combination with thalidomide. \n \nCaution is advised when zoledronic acid is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal products, as \nan increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly with these \nmedicinal products. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction \nstudies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. Zoledronic acid should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing \npotential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zoledronic acid is \ncontraindicated in breast-feeding women (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility  \nZoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 \ngeneration. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the \ncompound’s inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a \nbisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded \ndetermining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of zoledronic acid along with driving and \noperating of machinery.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nWithin three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with \nsymptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis with subsequent \njoint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days (see description of selected adverse \nreactions). \n \nThe following are the important identified risks with zoledronic acid in the approved indications:  \nRenal function impairment, osteonecrosis of the jaw, acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia, atrial \nfibrillation, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease. The frequencies for each of these identified risks are \nshown in Table 2. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions, listed in Table 2, have been accumulated from clinical studies and \npost-marketing reports following predominantly chronic treatment with 4 mg zoledronic acid: \n \nTable 2 \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \nconvention: Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n\n \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n  Common: \n  Uncommon: \n  Rare: \n\n \nAnaemia \nThrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia \nPancytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \n  Uncommon: \n  Rare: \n\n \nHypersensitivity reaction \nAngioneurotic oedema \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n  Uncommon: \n  Rare: \n\n \nAnxiety, sleep disturbance \nConfusion \n\nNervous system disorders \n  Common:  \n  Uncommon: \n   \n \n  Very rare: \n\n \nHeadache \nDizziness, paraesthesia, dysgeusia, \nhypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, tremor, \nsomnolence \nConvulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany \n(secondary to hypocalcaemia) \n\nEye disorders \n  Common: \n  Uncommon: \n   \n\nRare: \nVery rare: \n\n \nConjunctivitis \nBlurred vision, scleritis and orbital \ninflammation \nUveitis \nEpiscleritis  \n\nCardiac disorders \n  Uncommon: \n   \n \n\nRare: \n \n\n \nHypertension, hypotension, atrial \nfibrillation, hypotension leading to syncope \nor circulatory collapse \nBradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia (secondary \nto hypocalcaemia) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n  Uncommon: \n\nRare: \n\n \nDyspnoea, cough, bronchoconstriction  \nInterstitial lung disease \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n  Common: \n\n \nNausea, vomiting, decreased appetite  \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n  Uncommon: Diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, \ndyspepsia, stomatitis, dry mouth \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n  Uncommon: \n \n\n \nPruritus, rash (including erythematous and \nmacular rash), increased sweating \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n  Common: \n   \n  Uncommon: \n  Very rare: \n   \n\n \nBone pain, myalgia, arthralgia, generalised \npain \nMuscle spasms, osteonecrosis of the jaw \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \n(bisphosphonate class adverse reaction) and \nother anatomical sites including femur and \nhip \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n  Common: \n  Uncommon: \n  Rare: \n\n \nRenal impairment \nAcute renal failure, haematuria, proteinuria \nAcquired Fanconi syndrome \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n  Common: \n \n  Uncommon: \n \n \n \n \n  Rare: \n\n \nFever, flu-like syndrome (including fatigue, \nrigors, malaise and flushing) \nAsthenia, peripheral oedema, injection site \nreactions (including pain, irritation, \nswelling, induration), chest pain, weight \nincrease, anaphylactic reaction/shock, \nurticaria \nArthritis and joint swelling as a symptom of \nacute phase reaction \n\nInvestigations \n  Very common: \n  Common: \n \n  Uncommon: \n  Rare: \n\n \nHypophosphataemia \nBlood creatinine and blood urea increased, \nhypocalcaemia \nHypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia \nHyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nRenal function impairment  \nZoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety \ndata from zoledronic acid registration trials for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients \nwith advanced malignancies involving bone, the frequency of renal impairment adverse events \nsuspected to be related to zoledronic acid (adverse reactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma \n(3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other solid tumours (3.2%).  Factors \nthat may increase the potential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing \nrenal impairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant \nuse of nephrotoxic medicinal products or using a shorter infusion time than currently recommended. \nRenal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the \ninitial dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid (see section 4.4).  \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw  \nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as Zoledronic acid medac (see section 4.4). Many \nof these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection \nincluding osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions \nor other dental surgeries. \n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nAtrial fibrillation \nIn one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nzoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), \nthe overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5 % (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9 % (75 out of 3,852) in \npatients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious \nadverse events was 1.3 % (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6 % (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving \nzoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been \nobserved in other trials with zoledronic acid, including those with zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3 – 4 \nweeks in oncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this \nsingle clinical trial is unknown. \n \nAcute phase reaction  \nThis adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, \nheadache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint \nswelling. The onset time is ≤ 3 days post-zoledronic acid infusion, and the reaction is also referred to \nusing the terms “flu-like” or “post-dose” symptoms. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur  \nDuring post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare):  \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphopsphonate class adverse reaction). \n \nHypocalcaemia-related ADRs \nHypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with zoledronic acid in the approved indications. Based \non the review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an \nassociation between zoledronic acid therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary \ndevelopment of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between \nhypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, \nhypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nClinical experience with acute overdose of zoledronic acid is limited. The administration of doses up \nto 48 mg of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than \nthose recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment \n(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) \nabnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should \nbe administered as clinically indicated. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 11 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC code: \nM05BA08 \n \nZoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of \nosteoclastic bone resorption. \n \nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, \nbut the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In \nlong-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the \nformation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone. \n \nIn addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several anti-\ntumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone \ndisease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies: \n− In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone marrow \n\nmicroenvironment, making it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic activity and \nanti-pain activity. \n\n− In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on \ntumour cells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer medicinal products, anti-\nadhesion/invasion activity. \n\n \nClinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies \ninvolving bone \nThe first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to \nplacebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic \nacid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related \nevent (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of \nevents per patient – skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36 % risk reduction in \ndeveloping SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving \nzoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference \nreached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered \npathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. \nEfficacy results are provided in Table 3. \n \nIn a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg \nsignificantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by \n> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7 % risk \nreduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo.

Patients were \nevenly distributed between zoledronic acid-treated and placebo groups. \n \nThe SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The \nproportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8 % in the zoledronic \nacid-treated group versus 49.6 % in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first \nSRE was not reached in the zoledronic acid-treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly \nprolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41 % in \na multiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo. \n \nIn the zoledronic acid-treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the \nBrief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, \nwhen compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below \nbaseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score. \n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nFigure 1: Mean changes from baseline in BPI scores. Statistically significant differences are marked \n(*p< 0.05) for between treatment comparisons (4 mg zoledronic acid vs. placebo)  \n\n \n \nClinical trial results in the treatment of TIH \nClinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic \nacid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In Phase I dose \nfinding studies in patients with mild to moderate tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), effective \ndoses tested were in the range of approximately 1.2 – 2.5 mg. \n \nTo assess the effects of 4 mg zoledronic acid versus pamidronate 90 mg, the results of two pivotal \nmulticentre studies in patients with TIH were combined in a pre-planned analysis. There was faster \nnormalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and \n8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed: \n \nTable 6: Proportion of complete responders by day in the combined TIH studies  \n \n Day 4 Day 7 Day 10 \nZoledronic acid 4 mg (N=86) 45.3 % (p=0.104) 82.6 % (p=0.005)* 88.4 % (p=0.002)* \nZoledronic acid 8 mg (N=90) 55.6 % (p=0.021)* 83.3 % (p=0.010)* 86.7 % (p=0.015)* \nPamidronate 90 mg (N=99) 33.3 % 63.6 % 69.7 % \n*p-values compared to pamidronate. \n \nMedian time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected \nserum calcium ≥ 2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus 17 \ndays for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg \nzoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid \ndoses. \n \nIn clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, \n8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these \npatients was about 52 %. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data \navailable allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose. \n\nPlacebo    \nZoledronic acid 4 mg   \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n \nIn clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety \nprofile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was \nsimilar in types and severity.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nClinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to \n17 years \nThe effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) \nwith severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in \none international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment \ngroup, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening \nperiod during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In \nthe clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a \nmaximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg \nzoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was \nconducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly \nzoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year \nof treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral \ndensity (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but \nthe trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In \nparticular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse \nevents of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24 % (femur) and 14 % \n(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients versus 12 % and 5 % of pamidronate-treated patients with \nsevere osteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of \nfractures was comparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43 % (32/74) \nversus 41 % (31/76). Interpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are \ncommon events in patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process. \n \nThe type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in \nadults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked \nunder headings of frequency, are presented in Table 7. The following conventional classification is \nused: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nTable 7: Adverse reactions observed in paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta1 \n \nNervous system disorders \n  Common:  \n\n \nHeadache \n\nCardiac disorders \n  Common: \n\n \nTachycardia \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n  Common: \n\n \nNasopharyngitis \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n  Very common: \n  Common: \n\n \nVomiting, nausea \nAbdominal pain \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n  Common: \n\n \nPain in extremities, arthralgia, \nmusculoskeletal pain \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n  Very common: \n  Common: \n\n \nPyrexia, fatigue \nAcute phase reaction, pain \n\nInvestigations \n  Very common: \n  Common: \n\n \nHypocalcaemia \nHypophosphataemia \n\n1 Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5 % were medically assessed and it was shown that \nthese cases are consistent with the well-established safety profile of zoledronic acid (see section 4.8) \n \nIn paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with \nmore pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in \ncomparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nthe treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients \nwith advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSingle and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients \nwith bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose \nindependent.  \n \nAfter initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly \nincreased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10 % \nof peak after 4 hours and < 1 % of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very \nlow concentrations not exceeding 0.1 % of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day \n28. \n \nIntravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic \ndisappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by \na long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours. There was no \naccumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is \nnot metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16 % of the \nadministered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. \nFrom the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via \nthe kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, \nage, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30 % decrease \nin zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the \nplasma concentration versus time curve. \n \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nThe interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with \nother bisphosphonates. \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in \npatients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, \nshows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3 % of the administered dose was recovered in the \nfaeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. \n \nThe renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance \nrepresenting 75 ± 33 % of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/min (range 22 \nto 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with \ncreatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the \ncorresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37 % or 72%, respectively, of that of a \npatient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). \n \nIn an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, \nwith a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to \n5,000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at \n2 ng/ml to 77% at 2,000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid.  \n \nSpecial populations \nPaediatric patients \nLimited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic \nacid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg \ndose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic \nacid systemic exposure. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAcute toxicity \nThe highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in \nrats. \n \nSubchronic and chronic toxicity \nZoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to \ndogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously \nin rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 – 3 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well \ntolerated. \n \nThe most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the \nmetaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the \ncompound’s pharmacological antiresorptive activity. \n \nThe safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal \nstudies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and \nmultiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06 – 0.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses \nequivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat \nadministration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid \nproduced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and \nlungs, and at intravenous injection sites. \n \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nReproduction toxicity \nZoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses ≥ 0.2 mg/kg. Although no \nteratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was \nobserved at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat. \n \nMutagenicity and carcinogenic potential \nZoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did \nnot provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n Package leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nZoledronic acid medac 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion  \n \n\nZoledronic acid \n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Zoledronic acid medac is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic acid medac \n3. How Zoledronic acid medac is used \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zoledronic acid medac \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zoledronic acid medac is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance in Zoledronic acid medac is zoledronic acid, which belongs to a group of \nsubstances called bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing \ndown the rate of bone change. It is used: \n- to prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread of \n\ncancer from primary site to the bone). \n- to reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the \n\npresence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the \nrelease of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced \nhypercalcaemia (TIH). \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic acid medac \n \nFollow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. \n \nYour doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zoledronic acid medac and will \ncheck your response to treatment at regular intervals. \n \nYou should not be given Zoledronic acid medac \n- if you are breast-feeding. \n- if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which \n\nZoledronic acid medac belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Zoledronic acid medac, if you \n- have or have had a kidney problem. \n- have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the jaw or \n\nloosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start \ntreatment with Zoledronic acid medac. \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n- are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery; tell your dentist that you are \nbeing treated with Zoledronic acid medac and inform your doctor about your dental treatment. \n\n \nWhile being treated with Zoledronic acid medac, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including \nregular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. \n \nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth \nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a \ncondition called osteonecrosis of the jaw.  \nPatients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are \nundergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are \nsmokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \ndisorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nReduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry \nskin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Irregular heart \nbeat (cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to \nsevere hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these \napply to you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be \ncorrected before initiating the first dose of Zoledronic acid medac. You will be given adequate calcium \nand vitamin D supplements. \n \nPatients aged 65 years and over \nZoledronic acid medac can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest \nthat any extra precautions are needed. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nZoledronic acid medac is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of \n18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Zoledronic acid medac \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is \nespecially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: \n- • Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine \n\nused to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of \nmedicine to treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the \ncombination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become \ntoo low. \n\n- • Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or \nany other medicines which may harm your kidneys. \n\n- • Other medicines that also contain zoledronic acid and are used to treat osteoporosis and other \nnon-cancer diseases of the bone, or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of \nthese medicines taken together with Zoledronic acid medac are unknown. \n\n- Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with zoledronic \nacid has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou should not be given Zoledronic acid medac if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or \nthink that you may be pregnant.  \n \nYou must not be given Zoledronic acid medac if you are breast-feeding.  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nDriving and using machines \nThere have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of zoledronic acid. You \nshould therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that need full \nattention. \n \nZoledronic acid medac contains sodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’.  \n \n \n3. How Zoledronic acid medac is used \n \n- Zoledronic acid medac must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in administering \n\nbisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein. \n- Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent \n\ndehydration. \n- Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nHow much Zoledronic acid medac is given \n- The usual single dose given is 4 mg. \n- If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity \n\nof your kidney problem. \n \nHow often Zoledronic acid medac is given \n- If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you \n\nwill be given one infusion of Zoledronic acid medac every three to four weeks. \n- If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only \n\nbe given one infusion of Zoledronic acid medac. \n \nHow Zoledronic acid medac is given \n- Zoledronic acid medac is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least \n\n15 minutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion \nline. \n\n \nPatients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D \nsupplements to be taken each day. \n \nIf you are given more Zoledronic acid medac than you should be \nIf you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your \ndoctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of \ncalcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney \nimpairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by \ninfusion. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most \ncommon ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time. \n \nTell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away:  \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n- Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific \n\nblood tests).  \n- Low level of calcium in the blood.  \n\n\n\n 36 \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \n- Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw, \n\ndischarge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could be \nsigns of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you \nexperience such symptoms while being treated with Zoledronic acid medac or after stopping \ntreatment  \n\n- Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for \npostmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this \nirregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms \nafter you have received zoledronic acid.  \n\n- Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat.  \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to \n\nhypocalcaemia). \n- A kidney function disorder called Fanconi syndrome (will normally be determined by your \n\ndoctor with certain urine tests).  \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n- As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to \n\nhypocalcaemia. \n- Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These \n\ncould be signs of bone damage in the ear. \n- Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially \n\nthe hip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or \nworsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zoledronic acid medac or after \nstopping treatment. \n\n \nTell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- Low level of phosphate in the blood. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and \n\nbone, joint and/or muscle ache. In most cases no specific treatment is required and the \nsymptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days). \n\n- Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite. \n- Conjunctivitis. \n- Low level of red blood cells (anaemia). \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- Hypersensitivity reactions. \n- Low blood pressure. \n- Chest pain. \n- Skin reactions (redness and swelling) at the infusion site, rash, itching. \n- High blood pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleep disturbances, taste disturbances, \n\ntrembling, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dry mouth. \n- Low counts of white blood cells and blood platelets. \n- Low level of magnesium and potassium in the blood. Your doctor will monitor this and take any \n\nnecessary measures. \n- Weight increase.  \n- Increased sweating.  \n- Sleepiness.  \n- Blurred vision, tearing of the eye, eye sensitivity to light.  \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n- Sudden coldness with fainting, limpness or collapse.  \n- Difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing.  \n- Urticaria.  \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- Slow heartbeat. \n- Confusion. \n- Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for \n\nosteoporosis may occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or \ndiscomfort in your thigh, hip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of \nthe thigh bone. \n\n- Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs) \n- Flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling. \n- Painful redness and/or swelling of the eye.  \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n- Fainting due to low blood pressure. \n- Severe bone, joint and/or muscle pain, occasionally incapacitating. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from \n\nparticles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the \npreparation of the infusion.  \n\n \n• From a microbiological point of view, the solution for infusion should be used immediately, \n\nafter first opening. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are \nthe responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C – 8 °C, \nunless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. The refrigerated \nsolution should then be equilibrated to room temperature prior to administration.  \n\n \n• The solution containing zoledronic acid must not be further diluted or mixed with other infusion \n\nsolutions. It is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a separate infusion line. The \nhydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following administration of Zoledronic \nacid medac to ensure that they are adequately hydrated.  \n\n \n• Zoledronic acid medac 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion can be used immediately without \n\nfurther preparation for patients with normal renal function. In patients with mild to moderate \nrenal impairment, reduced doses should be prepared as instructed below.  \n\n \nTo prepare reduced doses for patients with baseline CLcr ≤ 60 ml/min, refer to Table 1 below. Remove \nthe volume of Zoledronic acid medac solution indicated from the bottle and replace with an equal \nvolume of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, or 5% w/v glucose solution \nfor injection. \n \nDo not mix Zoledronic acid medac with calcium-containing or other divalent cation containing \nsolutions such as lactated Ringer’s solution. \n\n \nTable 1: Preparation of reduced doses of Zoledronic acid medac 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion \n \nBaseline creatinine \nclearance (ml/min)  \n\nRemove the following \namount of Zoledronic \nacid medac solution \nfor infusion (ml)  \n\nReplace with the \nfollowing volume of \nsterile sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%), or 5% glucose \nsolution for injection \n(ml)  \n\nAdjusted dose (mg \nzoledronic acid in \n100 ml)  \n\n50-60 12.0 12.0 3.5 \n40-49 18.0 18.0 3.3 \n30-39 25.0 25.0 3.0 \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n 39 \n\n*Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg•hr/l) (CLcr=75 ml/min). The reduced \ndoses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in patients \nwith creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. \n \n• Studies with glass bottles, several types of infusion bags and infusion lines made from \n\npolyvinylchloride, polyethylene and polypropylene (prefilled with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection or 5% w/v glucose solution) showed no incompatibility with \nzoledronic acid. \n\n \n• Since no data are available on the compatibility of Zoledronic acid medac with other \n\nintravenously administered substances, Zoledronic acid medac must not be mixed with other \nmedications/substances and should always be given through a separate infusion line. \n\n \nHow to store Zoledronic acid medac \n• Keep Zoledronic acid medac out of the sight and reach of children. \n• Do not use Zoledronic acid medac after the expiry date stated on the bottle and carton after \n\nEXP. \n• The readily prepared Zoledronic acid medac infusion solution should preferably be used \n\nimmediately. If the solution is not used immediately, storage prior to use is the responsibility of \nthe user and should be in a refrigerator at 2 °C – 8 °C. \n\n• The total time between dilution, storage in the refrigerator and end of administration must not \nexceed 96 hours. \n\n• Do not freeze. \n \n \n \n\n\n\tAnnex II\n\tA. manufacturers responsible for batch release\n\tB.
