This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNUCEIVA 100 Units powder for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 100 Units botulinum toxin type A produced by Clostridium botulinum. \n \nAfter reconstitution each 0.1 mL of the solution contains 4 Units. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection.  \n \nWhite powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNUCEIVA is indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe \nvertical lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown (glabellar lines), when the severity of the \nabove facial lines has an important psychological impact in adults below 65 years of age. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNUCEIVA should only be administered by physicians with appropriate qualifications and expertise in \nthe treatment of glabellar lines and the use of required equipment. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended injection per muscle site is 4 U/0.1 mL. Five injection sites (see Figure 1): 2 \ninjections in each corrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior medial aspect) and 1 injection in the \nprocerus muscle for a total dose of 20 Units. \n \nBotulinum toxin units are not interchangeable from one product to another. Doses recommended are \ndifferent from other botulinum toxin preparations. \n \nIn the absence of adverse reactions during the initial treatment, an additional course of treatment can \nbe performed subject to a minimum interval of 3 months between the initial and repeat treatment. \n \nIn the event of treatment failure (no visible improvement of glabellar lines at maximum frown) one \nmonth after the first course of treatment, the following approaches may be considered: \n \n\u2022 Examination of the causes of failure, e.g. inappropriate injection technique, incorrect muscles \n\ninjected, and formation of botulinum toxin-neutralising antibodies. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\u2022 Re-evaluation of the appropriateness of treatment with botulinum toxin type A.  \n \nThe efficacy and safety of repeat injections beyond 12 months has not been evaluated. \n \nElderly patients \nThere are limited clinical data with NUCEIVA in patients older than 65 years (see section 5.1). \nNUCEIVA is not recommended for use in patients over 65 years of age.  \n \nNo specific dose adjustment is required for use in the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of NUCEIVA in the paediatric population.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntramuscular use. \n \nOnce reconstituted, NUCEIVA should only be used to treat a single patient, during a single session.  \n \nPrecaution to be taken before manipulating or administering the product \nFor instructions for use, precaution before manipulating or administering the product, handling and \ndisposal of the vials, see section 6.6. \n \nCare should be taken to ensure that NUCEIVA is not injected into a blood vessel when it is injected in \nthe vertical lines between the eyebrows seen at maximum frown (also known as glabellar lines) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPhysical manipulation (such as rubbing) of the injection site in the immediate post-administration \nperiod should be avoided. \n \nAdministration instructions for Glabellar Lines seen at maximum frown \nReconstituted NUCEIVA (100 Units/2.5 mL) is injected using a sterile 30 gauge needle.  \n \nIn order to reduce the complication of eyelid ptosis the following steps should be taken: \n \n\u2022 Two injections should be administered in each corrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior \n\nmedial aspect) and 1 injection in the procerus muscle for a total dose of 20 Units. \n \n\n\u2022 Injection near the levator palpebrae superioris should be avoided, particularly in patients with \nlarger brow depressor complexes. \n\n \n\u2022 Lateral corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 cm above the bony supraorbital ridge. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nGeneralised disorders of muscle activity (e.g. myasthenia gravis or Eaton Lambert Syndrome) \n \nInfection or inflammation at the proposed injection sites. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nThe anatomy and anatomical land marks of procerus corrugator supercilli muscles and the surrounding \nvasucular and nervous structures in the glabellar region must be understood prior to administration of \nNUCEIVA. Injection into vulnerable anatomical structures, such as nerves and blood vessels, must be \navoided. \n \nLocalised pain, inflammation, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, tenderness, swelling/oedema, erythema, \nlocalised infection, bleeding and/or bruising have been associated with the injection. Needle-related \npain and/or anxiety have resulted in vasovagal responses, including transient symptomatic hypotension \nand syncope. \n \nCaution should be taken when the targeted muscle shows pronouced weakness or atrophy. \n \nCare should be taken to ensure that NUCEIVA is not injected into a blood vessel when it is injected in \nthe glabellar lines seen at maximum frown (see section 4.2). \n \nThere is a risk of eyelid ptosis following treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nCaution should be taken if complications have resulted with previous botulinum toxin injections.  \n \nBleeding disorders \n \nCaution should be exercised when NUCEIVA is used in patients with bleeding disorders as injection \nmay lead to bruising. \n \nLocal and distant spread of toxin effect \n \nAdverse reactions possibly related to the spread of toxin distant from the site of administration have \nbeen reported very rarely with botulinum toxin (see section 4.8). Swallowing and breathing difficulties \nare serious and can result in death. Injection of NUCEIVA is not recommended in patients with a \nhistory of dysphagia and aspiration. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPatients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech or \nrespiratory disorders arise. \n \nPre-existing neuromuscular disorders \n \nPatients with unrecognised neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant \nsystemic effects, including severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from typical doses of \nbotulinum toxin type A. In some of these cases, dysphagia has lasted several months and required \nplacement of a gastric feeding tube (see section 4.3). \n \nCaution should also be exercised when botulinum toxin type A is used for treatment of patients with \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis or with peripheral neuromuscular disorders. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nAn anaphylactic reaction may occur very rarely after injection of botulinum toxin. Epinephrine \n(adrenaline) or any other anti-anaphylactic measures should therefore be available. \n \nAntibody formation \n \nAntibodies to botulinum toxin type A may develop during treatment with botulinum toxin. Some of \nthe antibodies formed are neutralising which may lead to treatment failure of botulinum toxin type A. \n \nIt is mandatory that NUCEIVA is used for one single patient treatment only during a single session. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nTheoretically, the effect of botulinum toxin may be potentiated by aminoglycoside antibiotics, \nspectinomycin, or other medicinal products that interfere with neuromuscular transmission (e.g. \nneuromuscular blocking medicinal products). \n \nThe effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxin serotypes at the same time or within \nseveral months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by \nadministration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously \nadministered botulinum toxin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of botulinum toxin type A in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). NUCEIVA is not recommended \nduring pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is no information on whether NUCEIVA is excreted in human breast milk. NUCEIVA should \nnot be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of NUCEIVA on human fertility is unknown. However, another botulinum toxin type A has \nbeen shown to impair the fertility of male and female animals. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNUCEIVA has a minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. There is a \npotential risk for asthenia, muscle weakness, dizziness and visual disturbance, which could affect \ndriving and the operation of machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nSerious undesirable effects that may occur following treatment with NUCEIVA include eyelid ptosis, \nan immune response, distant spread of toxin, development or exacerbation of a neuromuscular disorder, \nand hypersensitivity reactions. The most commonly reported adverse effects during treatment are \nheadache, occurring in 9.0% of patients, followed by eyelid ptosis, occurring in 1.0% of patients.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1 The NUCEIVA related adverse reactions are classified by System Organ Class and frequency \ndefined as follows: Very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nSystem Organ Class Preferred Term Frequency \nInfections and infestations Upper respiratory tract infection  Rare \nPsychiatric disorders Depression  Rare \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \n Common \n\nDizziness, migraine, muscle tone \ndisorder, speech disorder  \n\n Uncommon \n\nDysaesthesia, head discomfort, \nhypoaesthesia, paraesthesia, sensory \ndisturbance \n\n Rare \n\nEye disorders \n \n\nEyelid ptosis  Common \n\nAsthopenia, blepharospasm, \nbrow ptosis, eyelid oedema, \neye swelling, vision blurred \n\n Uncommon \n\nDiplopia, dry eye, eyelid \nsensory disorder \n\n Rare \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\nVertigo  Rare \n\nVascular disorders Flushing  Rare \n\n\n\n7 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nEpistaxis  Rare \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhea  Rare \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nPruritis  Uncommon \n\nDermal cyst, erythema, \nphotosensitivity reaction, skin \nmass, skin tightness \n\n Rare \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\n Muscle twitching, musculoskeletal \npain, myalgia, neck pain \n\n Rare \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nApplication site bruising, influenza \nlike illness, injection site bruising,  \ninjection site pain, injection site \nswelling \n\n Common \n\nInjection site: erythema, injection \nsite paresthesia, injection site \npruritis, pain, tenderness \n \n\n Rare \n\nInvestigations Intraocular pressure test  Rare \n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nContusion  Uncommon \n\nPost-procedural swelling, \nprocedural headache \n\n Rare \n\nNote: Of the 1659 subjects treated with NUCEIVA, rare events occurred in 1 subject only. \nUncommon events occurred in between 2 and 7 subjects. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nApplication related adverse reactions \nApplication related undesirable effects that have been reported following administration of NUCEIVA \nare uncommon events individually, common when added together. These include application and \ninjection site bruising, injection site pain and injection site swelling. Rarely occurring injection site \nevents that have been reported include erythema, paraesthesia, pruritis, pain and tenderness.  \n \nUndesirable effects of the substance class botulinum toxin type A \n \nMuscle atrophy \nMuscle atrophy is expected after repeated botulinum treatment secondary to the flaccid paralysis of the \ntreated muscles. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nToxin spread \nAdverse reactions possibly related to the spread of toxin distant from the site of administration have \nbeen reported very rarely with botulinum toxin (e.g. muscle weakness, dysphagia or constipation) (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nAn anaphylactic reaction may occur very rarely after injection of botulinum toxin. Epinephrine \n(adrenaline) or any other anti-anaphylactic measures should therefore be available. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms of overdose \n \nSigns of overdose may not be apparent immediately post-injection. Should accidental injection or \ningestion occur, the patient should be medically monitored for several days for signs and symptoms of \ngeneral weakness or muscle paralysis. Admission to hospital should be considered in patients \npresenting with symptoms of botulinum toxin type A poisoning (generalised weakness, ptosis, \ndiplopia, swallowing and speech disorders, or paresis of the respiratory muscles). \n \nToo frequent or excessive dosing may enhance the risk of antibody formation. Antibody formation \nmay lead to treatment failure.  \n \nOverdose of NUCEIVA depends upon dose, site of injection, and underlying tissue properties. No \ncases of systemic toxicity resulting from accidental injection of botulinum toxin type A have been \nobserved. Excessive doses may produce local or distant generalised and profound neuromuscular \nparalysis. No cases of ingestion of botulinum toxin type A have been reported. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nIn the event of overdose the patient should be medically monitored for symptoms of excessive muscle \nweakness or muscle paralysis. Symptomatic treatment should be instigated if necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Muscle relaxants, other muscle relaxants, peripherally acting agents, ATC \ncode: M03AX01. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBotulinum toxin type A (Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin) blocks peripheral acetylcholine release at \npresynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals by cleaving SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful \ndocking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within the nerve endings, thereby leading \nto denervation of the muscle and a flaccid paralysis. \n \nAfter injection, there is an initial rapid high-affinity binding of toxin to specific cell surface receptors. \nThis is followed by transfer of the toxin across the plasma membrane by receptor-mediated \n\n\n\n9 \n\nendocytosis. Finally, the toxin is released into the cytosol with progressive inhibition of acetylcholine \nrelease. Clinical signs are manifest within 2-3 days, with peak effect seen within 4 weeks of injection. \n \nRecovery after intramuscular injection takes place normally within 12 weeks of injection as nerve \nterminals sprout and reconnect with the endplates.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nGlabellar lines \n540 patients with moderate to severe glabellar lines seen at maximum frown who felt their glabellar \nlines had an important psychological impact (on mood, anxiety/or depressive symptoms) have been \nincluded in the European/Canadian clinical study. \n \nNUCEIVA injections significantly reduced the severity of glabellar lines by 1 point or greater at \nmaximum frown for up to 139 days, as measured by the investigator assessment of glabellar line \nseverity at maximum frown.  \n \nTable 2 \u2013 Primary Efficacy Endpoint \u2013 Glabellar Line Scale Score of 0 (none) or 1 (mild) at Day \n30 by Investigator Assessment at Maximum Contraction, PP Population \n \n\nResponders for \nthe Primary \nEfficacy \nEndpoint  \n\nPlacebo BOTOX NUCEIVA \n\nAbsolute Difference \n\nBOTOX   \nVs. \n\nPlacebo \n\nNUCEIVA    \nVs.

No beneficial effect was \ndemonstrated on psychological wellbeing but broadly favourable patient reported cosmetic outcomes \nwere recorded.  \n  \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNUCEIVA has not been detected in the peripheral blood following intramuscular injection at the \nrecommended dose. \n \nAbsorption, distribution, biotransformation and elimination (ADME) studies on the active substance \nhave not been performed due to the nature of this product. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of acute and \nrepeat dose toxicity. \n \nReproduction toxicity \n \nThe potential impact of NUCEIVA on fertility has not been investigated in animals. In pregnant rats, \ndaily intramuscular injections of 0.5, 1, or 4 Units/kg during the period of organogenesis (from \ngestation days 6 to 16), did not induce significant test article-related toxicological effects on the dams \nand on embryo-fetal development. Effects on peri-/postnatal development have not been evaluated. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nHuman albumin \n \nSodium chloride \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n \n30 months \n \nReconstituted solution \n \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 72 hours at 2 - 8\u00b0C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C, unless reconstitution/dilution has taken place \nin controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C). \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nVial (Type I glass) fitted with a stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) and a seal (aluminium). \n \nPack size of one. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nReconstitution should be performed in accordance with aseptic technique principles. NUCEIVA is \nreconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. As per the dilution table \n\n\n\n12 \n\nbelow, the amount of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection is drawn up into a syringe \nin order to obtain a reconstituted solution at a concentration of 4 Units/0.1 mL. \n \nAmount of solvent added (sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection) to a 100 Unit vial \n\nResulting dose (Units per 0.1 mL) \n\n2.5 mL 4 Units \n\n \nThe central part of the rubber cap should be cleaned with alcohol. \n \nThe solution is prepared by injecting the solvent slowly into the vial with a needle through the \nrubber stopper and by gently rotating the vial avoiding bubble formation. The vial has to be \ndiscarded if the vacuum does not pull the solvent into the vial. Once reconstituted, the solution \nshould be visually inspected prior to use. Only clear, colorless solution without particles should be \nused. \n \nReconstituted NUCEIVA (100 Units/2.5 mL) is injected using a sterile 30 gauge needle. Four Units \n(4 U/ 0.1 mL) are administered in each of the 5 injection sites (see Figure 1): 2 injections in each \ncorrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior medial aspect) and 1 injection in the procerus muscle \nfor a total dose of 20 Units. \n \nIt is mandatory that NUCEIVA is used for one single patient treatment only during a single session. \n \nProcedure to follow for a safe disposal of vials, syringes and materials used: \n \nImmediately after use, and prior to disposal, unused reconstituted NUCEIVA solution in the vial \nand/or the syringe must be inactivated, with 2 mL of dilute sodium hypochlorite solution at 0.5% or \n1% and should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nUsed vials, syringes, and materials should not be emptied and must be discarded into appropriate \ncontainers and disposed as a Medical Biohazardous Waste in accordance with local requirements. \n \nRecommendations in the event of an accident when handling botulinum toxin: \n \nIn the event of an accident when handling the product, whether in the vacuum-dried state or \nreconstituted, the appropriate measures described below must be initiated immediately. \n \n\u2022 The toxin is very sensitive to heat and certain chemical agents. \n \n\u2022 Any spillage must be wiped up: either with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of sodium \n\nhypochlorite in the case of the vacuum-dried product, or with a dry absorbent material in the \ncase of the reconstituted product. \n\n \n\u2022 Contaminated surfaces must be cleaned with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of \n\nsodium hypochlorite (Javel solution) and then dried. \n \n\u2022 If a vial is broken, carefully collect the pieces of glass and wipe up the product as stated above, \n\navoiding cuts to the skin. \n \n\u2022 If splashed on skin, wash with a solution of sodium hypochlorite and then rinse thoroughly with \n\nplenty of water. \n \n\u2022 If splashed into the eyes, rinse eyes thoroughly with plenty of water or with an eye wash \n\nsolution. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nIf the injector injures himself (cuts, pricks himself), proceed as above and take the appropriate medical \nsteps.  \n\nThese instructions for use, handling, and disposal should be strictly followed. \n\n7.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before NUCEIVA is used \n3. How to use NUCEIVA  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store NUCEIVA  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n1. What NUCEIVA is and what it is used for \n \nNUCEIVA contains the active substance botulinum toxin type A. \nIt prevents muscles from contracting, leading to a temporary paralysis. It works by blocking the nerve \nimpulses to the muscles in which it has been injected. \n \nNUCEIVA is used for the temporary improvement in the appearance of vertical lines between the \neyebrows. It is used in adults less than 65 years of age in whom those facial lines have an important \npsychological impact. \n \n2. What you need to know before NUCEIVA is used \n \nNUCEIVA must not be used: \n- if you are allergic to botulinum toxin type A or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6); \n- if you have myasthenia gravis or Eaton Lambert syndrome (chronic diseases affecting the \n\nmuscles); \n- if you have an infection or inflammation at the proposed injection sites. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nSide effects possibly related to the spread of botulinum toxin from the site of injection can occur very \nrarely (e.g. muscle weakness, difficulty in swallowing or food or liquid entering the airways). Patients \nreceiving recommended doses may have exaggerated muscle weakness. \n \nVisit your doctor immediately if you find it difficult to swallow, to speak or to breathe after treatment.  \n \n- NUCEIVA is not recommended in patients who have had problems swallowing (dysphagia) and \n\nbreathing. \n- Too frequent or excessive dosing may lead to antibody formation. Antibody formation can stop \n\nbotulinum toxin type A from working even for other uses. To prevent this, there must be a gap \nof at least three months between doses. \n\n- Very rarely, an allergic reaction can occur after the injection of botulinum toxin. \n- Drooping of the eyelid may occur after treatment. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor if: \n- you had problems with previous botulinum toxin injections; \n- you see no significant improvement of your lines one month after your first course of treatment; \n- you suffer from certain diseases affecting your nervous system (such as amyotrophic lateral \n\nsclerosis or motor neuropathy); \n- you have inflammation at the proposed injection site(s); \n- the muscles to be injected are weak or wasted; \n- you have a bleeding disorder as injection may lead to bruising. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of NUCEIVA is not recommended in individuals under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and NUCEIVA \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nThe use of botulinum toxin is not recommended in association with aminoglycoside antibiotics, \nspectinomycin or other medicines that interfere with nerve impulses to the muscle. \n \nTell your doctor if you have recently been injected with a medicine containing botulinum toxin (the \nactive substance of NUCEIVA), as this may increase the effect of NUCEIVA excessively. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask \nyour doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. \n \nThe use of NUCEIVA is not recommended during pregnancy and in women able to have children who \nare not using contraception.  \n \nNUCEIVA is not recommended in breast-feeding women. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nMuscle weakness, dizziness, and visual disturbance with this medicine could make driving or the use \nof machines dangerous. Do not drive or use machinery until such effects have cleared. \n \nNUCEIVA contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose; this means it is essentially \n\u2018sodium- free\u2019. \n \n3. How to use NUCEIVA \n \nUnit doses for NUCEIVA are not interchangeable with those used for other preparations of botulinum \ntoxin. \n \nNUCEIVA should only be injected by physicians with appropriate qualifications and expertise in the \ntreatment of glabellar lines at maximum frown. \n \nThe usual dose of NUCEIVA is 20 Units. You will be injected with the recommended volume of \n0.1 millilitre (ml) (4 Units) of NUCEIVA into each of 5 injection sites. \n \nImprovement of severity of the lines between the eyebrows generally occurs within a few days of \ntreatment.   \n \nThe interval between treatments will be decided by your doctor. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nHow NUCEIVA is injected  \n \nNUCEIVA is injected into your muscles (intramuscularly), directly into the affected area above and \nbetween the eyebrows. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nIn general, side effects occur within the first few days after injection and are temporary. Most side \neffects are of mild to moderate severity. \n \nIf you have any difficulty in breathing, swallowing or speaking after receiving NUCEIVA contact \nyour doctor immediately.  \n \nIf you get hives, swelling, including swelling of the face or throat, wheezing, feeling faint or shortness \nof breath, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nThe chance of having a side effect is described by the following categories: \n \n\nCommon \n \n(May affect up to 1 \nin 10 people) \n\nHeadache, muscle imbalance resulting in elevated or asymmetrical eyebrows, \neyelid drooping, injection site bruise \n\nUncommon  \n \n(May affect up to 1 \nin 100 people) \n\nSensory disturbance, head discomfort, dry eye, eyelid swelling, eye swelling, \nmuscle twitching, injection site: redness, pain, tingling \n \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n5. How to store NUCEIVA \n \nKeep out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nUnopened vial \n \nDo not use NUCEIVA after the expiry date which is stated on the vial and the carton after EXP. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat NUCEIVA contains  \n- The active substance is: 100 Units botulinum toxin type A. \n- The other ingredients are human albumin and sodium chloride.  \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nWhat NUCEIVA looks like and contents of the pack \nNUCEIVA is presented as a white powder for solution for injection in a transparent glass vial.  \nEach pack contains 1 vial. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder  \nEvolus Pharma Limited \n70 Sir John Rogerson\u2019s Quay \nDublin 2  \nIreland \n \nManufacturers \nBaggerman Farmanet N.V. \nBarrierweg 3G \n5622 CL Eindhoven \nThe Netherlands  \n \nFor any information about this medicine, please contact the the Marketing Authorisation Holder \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in{month YYYY}. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \n \nTHE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR MEDICAL OR HEALTHCARE \nPROFESSIONALS ONLY: \n \nBotulinum toxin units are not interchangeable from one product to another. Doses recommended in \nunits are different from other botulinum toxin preparations. \n \nReconstitution should be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, particularly with respect \nto aseptic technique. NUCEIVA is reconstituted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninjection . 2.5 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection is drawn up into a syringe \nin order to obtain a reconstituted solution for injection at a concentration of 4 Units/0.1 mL. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nThe central part of the rubber cap should be cleaned with alcohol. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial \nwith a needle through the rubber stopper and gently rotate the vial avoiding bubble formation. The vial \nhas to be discarded if the vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial. Once reconstituted, the \nsolution for injection should be visually inspected prior to use to verify it is a clear, colourless solution \nfree of particulate matter. \n \nReconstituted NUCEIVA (100 Units/2.5 mL) is injected using a sterile 30 gauge needle. Four Units \n(4 U/ 0.1 mL) are administered in each of the 5 injection sites (see Figure 1): 2 injections in each \ncorrugator muscle (inferior medial and superior medial aspect) and 1 injection in the procerus muscle \nfor a total dose of 20 Units. \n \n\nAmount of diluent added to 100 Unit vial \n(sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection) \n\n2.5 mL \n\nResulting dose \n(Units per 0.1 mL) \n\n4.0 U \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n \nIn order to reduce the complication of eyelid ptosis the following steps should be taken: \n \n- Avoid injection near the levator palpebrae superioris, particularly in patients with larger brow \n\ndepressor complexes. \n- Lateral corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 cm above the bony supraorbital ridge. \n- Ensure the injected volume/dose is accurate and where feasible kept to a minimum. \n \nProcedure to follow for safe disposal of vials, syringes and materials used: \n \nImmediately after use, unused reconstituted NUCEIVA solution for injection in the vial and/or the \nsyringe must be inactivated, prior to disposal, with 2 mL of dilute sodium hypochlorite solution at 0.5% \nor 1% available chlorine.  Following inactivation, dispose of in accordance with local requirements. \nUsed vials, syringes and materials should not be emptied and must be discarded into appropriate \ncontainers and disposed of according to local regulations. \n \nRecommendations in the event of an accident when handling botulinum toxin: \n \nIn the event of an accident when handling the product, whether in the vacuum-dried state or \nreconstituted, the appropriate measures described below must be initiated immediately. \n \n- The toxin is very sensitive to heat and certain chemical agents. \n \n- Any spillage must be wiped up: either with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of sodium \n\nhypochlorite (Javel solution) in the case of the vacuum-dried product, or with a dry absorbent \nmaterial in the case of the reconstituted product. \n\n \n- Contaminated surfaces must be cleaned with an absorbent material soaked in a solution of \n\nsodium hypochlorite (Javel solution) and then dried. \n \n- If a vial is broken, carefully collect the pieces of glass and wipe up the product as stated above, \n\navoiding cuts to the skin. \n \n- If splashed, wash with a solution of sodium hypochlorite and then rinse thoroughly with plenty of \n\nwater. \n \n- If splashed into the eyes, rinse eyes thoroughly with plenty of water or with an eye wash solution. \n \n- If the operator injures himself (cuts, pricks himself), proceed as above and take the appropriate \n\nmedical steps according to the dose injected. \n \nThese instructions for use, handling and disposal should be strictly followed. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
