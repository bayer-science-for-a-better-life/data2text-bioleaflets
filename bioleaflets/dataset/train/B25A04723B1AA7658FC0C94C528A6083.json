CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children from the age of 1 year. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThis medicinal product is a basal insulin for once-daily subcutaneous administration at any time of the \nday, preferably at the same time every day. \n \nThe potency of insulin analogues, including insulin degludec, is expressed in units. One (1) unit of \ninsulin degludec corresponds to 1 international unit of human insulin, 1 unit of insulin glargine \n(100 units/mL), or 1 unit of insulin detemir. \n \nIn patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, this medicinal product can be administered alone or in any \n\n\n\n3 \n\ncombination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists and bolus insulin (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba must be combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin to cover \nmealtime insulin requirements. \n \nTresiba is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient\u2019s needs. It is recommended to optimise \nglycaemic control via dose adjustment based on fasting plasma glucose. \n \nAdjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their \nusual diet or during concomitant illness. \n \nTresiba 100 units/mL and Tresiba 200 units/mL solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \nTresiba is available in two strengths. For both, the needed dose is dialled in units. The dose steps, \nhowever, differ between the two strengths of the medicinal product.  \n\u2022 With Tresiba 100 units/mL a dose of 1\u201380 units per injection, in steps of 1 unit, can be \n\nadministered. \n\u2022 With Tresiba 200 units/mL a dose of 2\u2013160 units per injection, in steps of 2 units, can be \n\nadministered. The dose is provided in half the volume of 100 units/mL basal insulin products. \nThe dose counter shows the number of units regardless of strength and no dose conversion should be \ndone when transferring a patient to a new strength. \n \nFlexibility in dosing time \nOn occasions when administration at the same time of the day is not possible, Tresiba allows for \nflexibility in the timing of insulin administration (see section 5.1). A minimum of 8 hours between \ninjections should always be ensured. There is no clinical experience with flexibility in dosing time of \nTresiba in children and adolescents. \n \nPatients who forget a dose are advised to take it upon discovery and then resume their usual once-daily \ndosing schedule. \n \nInitiation \nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \nThe recommended daily starting dose is 10 units followed by individual dosage adjustments. \n \nPatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus \nTresiba is to be used once daily with mealtime insulin and requires subsequent individual dosage \nadjustments. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \nClose glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the following weeks. Doses and \ntiming of concurrent rapid-acting or short-acting insulin products or other concomitant antidiabetic \ntreatment may need to be adjusted. \n \nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \nFor patients with type 2 diabetes taking once-daily basal, basal-bolus, premix or self-mixed insulin \ntherapy, changing the basal insulin to Tresiba can be done unit-to-unit based on the previous basal \ninsulin dose followed by individual dosage adjustments. \n \nA dose reduction of 20% based on the previous basal insulin dose followed by individual dosage \nadjustments should be considered when  \n- transferring to Tresiba from twice-daily basal insulin \n- transferring to Tresiba from insulin glargine (300 units/mL) \n \nPatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus \nFor patients with type 1 diabetes a dose reduction of 20% based on the previous basal insulin dose or \nbasal component of a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion regimen should be considered with \n\n\n\n4 \n\nsubsequent individual dosage adjustments based on the glycaemic response. \n \nUse of Tresiba in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \n \nWhen adding Tresiba to GLP-1 receptor agonists, the recommended daily starting dose is 10 units \nfollowed by individual dosage adjustments. \n \nWhen adding GLP-1 receptor agonists to Tresiba, it is recommended to reduce the dose of Tresiba by \n20% to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Subsequently, dosage should be adjusted individually. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly (\u226565 years old)  \nTresiba can be used in elderly. Glucose monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on \nan individual basis (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nTresiba can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose monitoring is to be intensified and \nthe insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no clinical experience with the use of this medicinal product in children below the age of \n1 year. This medicinal product can be used in adolescents and children from the age of 1 year (see \nsection 5.1). When changing basal insulin to Tresiba, dose reduction of basal and bolus insulin needs \nto be considered on an individual basis in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section \n4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \nSubcutaneous use only. \n \nTresiba must not be administered intravenously as it may result in severe hypoglycaemia.  \nThis medicinal product must not be administered intramuscularly as it may change the absorption.  \nThis medicinal product must not be used in insulin infusion pumps. \nTresiba must not be drawn from the cartridge of the pre-filled pen into a syringe (see section 4.4). \n \nTresiba is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh, the upper arm or the abdominal wall. \nInjection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of \nlipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nPatients should be instructed to always use a new needle. The re-use of insulin pen needles increases \nthe risk of blocked needles, which may cause under- or overdosing. In the event of blocked needles, \npatients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for use accompanying the package \nleaflet (see section 6.6). \n \nTresiba 100 units/mL and Tresiba 200 units/mL solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \nTresiba comes in a pre-filled pen (FlexTouch) designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist \ninjection needles.  \n\u2013 The 100 units/mL pre-filled pen delivers 1\u201380 units in steps of 1 unit. \n\u2013 The 200 units/mL pre-filled pen delivers 2\u2013160 units in steps of 2 units. \n \nTresiba 100 units/mL solution for injection in a cartridge \nTresiba comes in a cartridge (Penfill) designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems \nand NovoFine or NovoTwist injection needles. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypoglycaemia \nOmission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see \nsections 4.5, 4.8 and 4.9). \nIn children, care should be taken to match insulin doses (especially in basal-bolus regimens) with food \nintake and physical activities in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. \nPatients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved (e.g. by intensified insulin therapy) may \nexperience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and must be advised \naccordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with long-standing diabetes. \n \nConcomitant illness, especially infections and fever, usually increases the patient's insulin \nrequirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or \nthyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose. \n \nAs with other basal insulin products, the prolonged effect of Tresiba may delay recovery from \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nHyperglycaemia \nAdministration of rapid-acting insulin is recommended in situations with severe hyperglycaemia. \n \nInadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of treatment in patients requiring insulin may lead to \nhyperglycaemia and potentially to diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially \ninfections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased insulin requirement. \n \nUsually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop gradually over a period of hours or days. They \ninclude thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry \nmouth, and loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, untreated \nhyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is potentially lethal. \n \nTransfer from other insulin medicinal products \nTransferring a patient to another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin must be done under medical \nsupervision and may result in the need for a change in dosage. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin \nabsorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A \nsudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia.  \nBlood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site from an affected to an \nunaffected area, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic medications may be considered. \n \nCombination of pioglitazone and insulin medicinal products \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac failure. This should be kept in mind \nif treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Tresiba is considered. If the combination is \nused, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n \nEye disorder \nIntensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated \nwith temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control \ndecreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n \nAvoidance of medication errors \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between the two different strengths of Tresiba as well as other insulin products.  \n \nPatients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the \nrequirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who \nare blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who \nhas good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. \n \nTo avoid dosing errors and potential overdose, patients and healthcare professionals should never use \na syringe to draw the medicinal product from the cartridge in the pre-filled pen. \nIn the event of blocked needles, patients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for \nuse accompanying the package leaflet (see section 6.6). \n \nInsulin antibodies \nInsulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin \nantibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nA number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism. \n \nThe following substances may reduce the insulin requirement \nOral antidiabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n(MAOI), beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids \nand sulfonamides. \n \nThe following substances may increase the insulin requirement \nOral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth \nhormone and danazol. \n \nBeta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nOctreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. \n \nAlcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nPregnancy \nThere is no clinical experience with the use of Tresiba in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not revealed any difference between insulin degludec and human \ninsulin regarding embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. \n \nIn general, intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are \nrecommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually \ndecrease in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After \ndelivery, insulin requirements usually return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nThere is no clinical experience with Tresiba during breast-feeding. In rats, insulin degludec was \nsecreted in milk; the concentration in milk was lower than in plasma. \n \nIt is unknown whether insulin degludec is excreted in human milk. No metabolic effects are \nanticipated in the breast-fed newborn/infant. \n \nFertility \nAnimal reproduction studies with insulin degludec have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nThis medicinal product has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nHowever, the patient\u2019s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. \nThis may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a \ncar or using machines). \n \nPatients must be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is particularly \nimportant in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or \nhave frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these \ncircumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia (see section \n\u2018Description of selected adverse reactions\u2019 below). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions listed below are based on clinical trial data and classified according to MedDRA \nSystem Organ Class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention: Very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders Rare  Hypersensitivity \n\nUrticaria \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Very common  Hypoglycaemia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon Lipodystrophy \n\nNot known Cutaneous amyloidosis\u2020 \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions Common  Injection site reactions \n\nUncommon  Peripheral oedema \n\u2020 ADR from postmarketing sources. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders \nWith insulin preparations, allergic reactions may occur. Immediate-type allergic reactions to either \ninsulin itself or the excipients may potentially be life-threatening. \n \nWith Tresiba, hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhoea, nausea, \ntiredness and itching) and urticaria were reported rarely. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe \nhypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or \npermanent impairment of brain function or even death. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur \n\n\n\n8 \n\nsuddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, \nunusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, \nvision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the \ninjection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the \ngiven injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). \n \nInjection site reactions \nInjection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemorrhage, erythema, nodules, \nswelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) occurred in patients treated with \nTresiba. These reactions are usually mild and transitory and they normally disappear during continued \ntreatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nTresiba has been administered to children and adolescents up to 18 years of age for the investigation \nof pharmacokinetic properties (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in a long \nterm trial in children aged 1 to less than 18 years. The frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions in the paediatric population do not indicate differences to the experience in the general \ndiabetes population (see section 5.1). \n \nOther special populations \nBased on results from clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions observed in \nelderly and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate any differences to the broader \nexperience in the general population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nA specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined. However, hypoglycaemia may develop over \nsequential stages if a patient is dosed with more insulin than required: \n \n\u2022 Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or other products \n\ncontaining sugar. It is therefore recommended that the patient always carries glucose-containing \nproducts. \n\n \n\u2022 Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient is not able to treat himself, can be treated \n\nwith glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or \nwith glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given \nintravenously if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon \nregaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in \norder to prevent a relapse. \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting. \nATC code: A10AE06.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nMechanism of action \nInsulin degludec binds specifically to the human insulin receptor and results in the same \npharmacological effects as human insulin. \n \nThe blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following the \nbinding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose \noutput from the liver. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nTresiba is a basal insulin that forms soluble multi-hexamers upon subcutaneous injection, resulting in \na depot from which insulin degludec is continuously and slowly absorbed into the circulation leading \nto a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect of Tresiba (see figure 1). During a period of 24 hours with \nonce-daily treatment, the glucose-lowering effect of Tresiba, in contrast to insulin glargine, was evenly \ndistributed between the first and second 12 hours (AUCGIR,0-12h,SS/AUCGIR,total,SS = 0.5). \n \n\n \n\n \n\nTime since injection (hours) \nTreatment IDeg 0.6 units/kg \n\nG\nlu\n\nco\nse\n\n In\nfu\n\nsio\nn \n\nRa\nte\n\n (m\ng/\n\n(k\ng*\n\nm\nin\n\n)) \n\n  \nFigure 1 Glucose infusion rate profile, smoothed, steady state - Mean profile 0-24 hours - IDeg \n100 units/mL 0.6 units/kg - Trial 1987 \n \nThe duration of action of Tresiba is beyond 42 hours within the therapeutic dose range.  \n \nSteady state will occur after 2\u20133 days of dose administration. \n \nThe day-to-day variability, expressed as the coefficient of variation, in glucose-lowering effect during \none dosing interval of 0-24 hours at steady state (AUCGIR,\u03c4,SS) is 20% for insulin degludec, which is \nsignificantly lower  than for insulin glargine (100 units/mL). \n \nThe total glucose-lowering effect of Tresiba increases linearly with increasing doses. \n \nThe total glucose-lowering effect is comparable for Tresiba 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL after \nadministration of the same doses of the two products. \n \nThere is no clinically relevant difference in the pharmacodynamics of this medicinal product between \nelderly and younger adult patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n11 multinational clinical trials of 26 or 52 weeks\u2019 duration were conducted as controlled, open-label, \nrandomised, parallel, treat-to-target trials exposing 4,275 patients to Tresiba (1,102 in type 1 diabetes \nmellitus and 3,173 in type 2 diabetes mellitus).  \n \nIn the open-label trials the effect of Tresiba was tested in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (Table \n2), in insulin na\u00efve patients (insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes mellitus, Table 3) and in previous \ninsulin users (insulin intensification in type 2 diabetes mellitus, Table 4) with fixed as well as flexible \n\n\n\n10 \n\ndosing time (Table 5), and the reduction in HbA1c from baseline to end of trial was confirmed to be \nnon-inferior in all trials against all comparators (insulin detemir and insulin glargine (100 units/mL)). \nWhile improvements in HbA1c were non-inferior compared to other insulin products, against sitagliptin \nTresiba was statistically significantly superior in reducing HbA1c (Table 4).  \n \nIn a prospectively planned meta-analysis across seven open-label treat-to-target confirmatory trials in \npatients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba was superior in terms of a lower number of \ntreatment-emergent confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (driven by a benefit in type 2 diabetes \nmellitus, see Table 1) and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes compared to insulin glargine \n(100 units/ml) (administered according to label). The reduction in hypoglycaemia was achieved at a \nlower average FPG level with Tresiba than with insulin glargine.  \n \nTable 1 Hypoglycaemia meta-analysis outcomes \n\n Confirmed hypoglycaemiaa \nEstimated risk ratio (Insulin degludec/Insulin glargine)  Total Nocturnal \nType 1 + Type 2 diabetes mellitus (pooled) 0.91* 0.74* \n\nMaintenance period b 0.84* 0.68* \nGeriatric patients \u226565 years 0.82 0.65* \n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus 1.10 0.83 \nMaintenance period b 1.02 0.75* \n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus  0.83* 0.68* \nMaintenance period b 0.75* 0.62* \nBasal only therapy in previously insulin-na\u00efve 0.83* 0.64* \n\n*Statistically significant a Confirmed hypoglycaemia was defined as episodes confirmed by plasma glucose <3.1 mmol/L or \nby the patient needing third party assistance.

In the insulin degludec + liraglutide arm, the insulin dose was \nreduced by 20% in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Addition of liraglutide resulted in a \nstatistically significantly greater reduction of HbA1c (-0.73% for liraglutide vs -0.40% for comparator, \nestimated means) and body weight (-3.03 vs 0.72 kg, estimated means). The rate of hypoglycaemic \nepisodes (per patient year of exposure) was statistically significantly lower when adding liraglutide \ncompared to adding a single dose of insulin aspart (1.0 vs 8.15; ratio: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.21). \n \nFurthermore, two 64-week controlled, double-blind, randomised, cross-over, treat-to-target trials were \nconducted in patients with at least one risk factor for hypoglycaemia and with type 1 diabetes mellitus \n(501 patients) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (721 patients). Patients were randomised to either Tresiba or \ninsulin glargine (100 units/mL) followed by cross-over. The trials evaluated the rate of hypoglycaemia \nupon treatment with Tresiba compared to insulin glargine (100 units/mL) (see Table 6). \n \nTable 6 Results from the double-blind, cross-over clinical trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetes \nmellitus \n\n Type 1 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus \n Tresiba1 Insulin glargine \n\n(100 units/mL)1 Tresiba2 Insulin glargine \n(100 units/mL)2 \n\nN 501 721 \nHbA1c (%) \nBaseline 7.6 7.6 \nEnd of treatment 6.9 6.9 7.1 7.0 \nFPG (mmol/L) \nBaseline 9.4 7.6 \nEnd of treatment 7.5 8.4 6.0 6.1 \nRate of severe hypoglycaemia3  \n\nMaintenance period4 0.69 0.92 0.05 0.09 \nRatio: 0.65 [0.48; 0.89] Ratio: 0.54 [0.21; 1.42] \n\nRate of severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia3,5 \nMaintenance period4 22.01 24.63 1.86 2.65 \n\n\n\n13 \n\nRatio: 0.89 [0.85; 0.94] Ratio: 0.70 [0.61; 0.80] \nRate of severe or BG confirmed symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia3.5  \n\nMaintenance period4 2.77 4.29 0.55 0.94 \nRatio: 0.64 [0.56; 0.73] Ratio: 0.58 [0.46; 0.74] \n\n1 In a once-daily regimen + insulin aspart to cover mealtime insulin requirements \n2 In a once-daily regimen \u00b1 OADs (any combination of metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, alpha-glucosidase \ninhibitor, thiazolidinediones, and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor) \n3 Per patient year of exposure \n4 Episodes from week 16 in each treatment period  \n5 Blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as episodes confirmed by a plasma glucose value \nof less than 3.1 mmol/L, with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.

The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial to exclude a pre-specified risk margin \nof 1.3 for the hazard ratio (HR) of MACE comparing Tresiba to insulin glargine. The cardiovascular \nsafety of Tresiba as compared to insulin glargine was confirmed (HR 0.91 [0.78; 1.06]) (Figure 2).  \nResults from subgroup analyses (e.g. sex, diabetes duration, CV risk group and previous insulin \nregimen) was aligned with the primary analysis. \n \n \n\nPrimary analysis (3-point MACE) \n\nCV Death \n\nNon-fatal Stroke \n\nNon-fatal MI \n\nAll cause death \n\n0.90 (0.65-1.23) \n\n0.85 (0.68-1.06) \n\n0.91 (0.75-1.11) \n\n0.96 (0.76-1.21) \n\n0.91 (0.78-1.06) \n\nHazard Ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n71 (1.86) \n\n144 (3.77) \n\n202 (5.29) \n\n136 (3.56) \n\n325 (8.51) \n\nInsulin degludec \nN (%) \n\n79 (2.07) \n\n169 (4.43) \n\n221 (5.79) \n\n142 (3.72) \n\n356 (9.32) \n\nInsulin glargine \nN (%) \n\n0.7 0.9 1 1.1 1.3 \nFavours \n\ninsulin degludec \nFavours \n\ninsulin glargine \n\n \nN: Number of subjects with a first EAC confirmed event during trial. %: Percentage of subjects with a first EAC confirmed event relative to \nthe number of randomised subjects.

Patients in the Tresiba arm included 43 children aged 1\u20135 years, \n70 children aged 6\u201311 years and 61 adolescents aged 12\u201317 years. Tresiba dosed once daily showed \nsimilar reduction in HbA1c at week 52 and greater reduction in FPG from baseline versus the \ncomparator insulin detemir dosed once or twice daily. This was achieved with 30% lower daily doses \nof Tresiba compared to insulin detemir. The rates (events per patient-year of exposure) of severe \nhypoglycaemia (ISPAD definition; 0.51 vs 0.33), confirmed hypoglycaemia (57.71 vs 54.05) and \nnocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia (6.03 vs 7.60) were comparable with Tresiba versus insulin \ndetemir. In both treatment arms, children aged 6-11 years had a numerically higher rate of confirmed \nhypoglycaemia than in the other age groups. A numerically higher rate of severe hypoglycaemia in \nchildren aged 6-11 years in the Tresiba arm was observed. The rate of hyperglycaemic episodes with \nketosis was significantly lower for Tresiba versus insulin detemir, 0.68 and 1.09, respectively. No \nsafety issues were identified with Tresiba with respect to adverse events and standard safety \nparameters. Antibody development was sparse and had no clinical impact. Efficacy and safety data for \nadolescent patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been extrapolated from data for adolescent and \nadult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results \nsupport the use of Tresiba in adolescent patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter subcutaneous injection, soluble and stable multi-hexamers are formed creating a depot of insulin \nin the subcutaneous tissue. Insulin degludec monomers gradually separate from the multi-hexamers \nthus resulting in a slow and continuous delivery of insulin degludec into the circulation. \n \nSteady-state serum concentration is reached after 2\u20133 days of daily Tresiba administration. \n \nDuring a period of 24 hours with once-daily treatment, the exposure of insulin degludec was evenly \ndistributed between the first and second 12 hours. The ratio between AUCIDeg,0-12h,SS and AUCIDeg,\u03c4,SS \n\nwas 0.5. \n \nDistribution \nThe affinity of insulin degludec to serum albumin corresponds to a plasma protein binding of >99% in \nhuman plasma. \n \nBiotransformation \nDegradation of insulin degludec is similar to that of human insulin; all metabolites formed are \ninactive. \n \nElimination \nThe half-life after subcutaneous administration of Tresiba is determined by the rate of absorption from \nthe subcutaneous tissue. The half-life of Tresiba is approximately 25 hours independent of dose. \n \nLinearity \n\n\n\n15 \n\nDose proportionality in total exposure is observed after subcutaneous administration within the \ntherapeutic dose range. In direct comparison, requirements for bioequivalence are met for Tresiba \n100 units/mL and Tresiba 200 units/mL (based on AUCIDeg,\u03c4,SS and Cmax,IDeg,SS). \n \nGender \nThere is no gender difference in the pharmacokinetic properties of this medicinal product. \n \nElderly, race, renal and hepatic impairment \nThere is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec between elderly and younger adult \npatients, between races or between healthy subjects and patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetic properties of insulin degludec in children (1-11 years) and adolescents (12-18 years) \nwere at steady state comparable to those observed in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Total \nexposure after a single dose was, however, higher in children and adolescents than in adults with type \n1 diabetes mellitus. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no safety concerns for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction. \n \nThe ratio of mitogenic relative to metabolic potency for insulin degludec is comparable to that of \nhuman insulin. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\u2013 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\u2013 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2013 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Tresiba is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Tresiba \n3. How to use Tresiba \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Tresiba \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tresiba is and what it is used for \n \nTresiba is a long-acting basal insulin called insulin degludec. It is used to treat diabetes mellitus in \nadults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. Tresiba helps your body reduce your blood \nsugar level. It is used for once-daily dosing. On occasions when you cannot follow your regular dosing \nschedule, you can change the time of dosing because Tresiba has a long blood sugar-lowering effect \n(see section 3 for \u2018Flexibility in dosing time\u2019). Tresiba can be used with meal-related rapid-acting \ninsulin products. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba may be used in combination with tablets for \ndiabetes or with injectable antidiabetic medicines, other than insulin.  \nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba must always be used in combination with meal-related rapid-acting \ninsulin medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Tresiba \n \nDo not use Tresiba \n\u2022 if you are allergic to insulin degludec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tresiba. Be especially aware of the following: \n \n\u2022 Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) \u2013 if your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low \n\nblood sugar in section 4. \n\u2022 High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \u2013 if your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for \n\nhigh blood sugar in section 4. \n\u2022 Switching from other insulin medicines \u2013 the insulin dose may need to be changed if you switch \n\nfrom another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin. Talk to your doctor. \n\u2022 Pioglitazone used together with insulin, see \u2018Pioglitazone\u2019 below. \n\u2022 Eye disorder \u2013 fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of \n\ndiabetic eye disorder. If you experience eye problems, talk to your doctor. \n\u2022 Ensuring you use the right type of insulin \u2013 always check the insulin label before each injection \n\nto avoid accidental mix-ups between different strengths of Tresiba as well as other insulin \nproducts. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \nIf you have poor eyesight, please see section 3. \n \nSkin changes at the injection site \nThe injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as \nskin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you \ninject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 \u2018How to use Tresiba\u2019). Tell your doctor \nif you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into \nthese affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check \nyour blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTresiba can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. There is no experience with \nthe use of Tresiba in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and Tresiba \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, this may mean your insulin dose has to be \nchanged. \n \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n\u2022 other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable) \n\u2022 sulfonamides, for infections \n\u2022 anabolic steroids, such as testosterone \n\u2022 beta-blockers, for high blood pressure. They may make it harder to recognise the warning signs \n\nof too low blood sugar (see section 4 \u2018Warning signs of too low blood sugar\u2019) \n\u2022 acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates), for pain and mild fever \n\u2022 monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, for depression \n\u2022 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for some heart problems or high blood \n\npressure. \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n\u2022 danazol, for endometriosis \n\u2022 oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \n\u2022 thyroid hormones, for thyroid problems \n\u2022 growth hormone, for growth hormone deficiency \n\u2022 glucocorticoids such as \u2018cortisone\u2019, for inflammation \n\u2022 sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline, for asthma \n\u2022 thiazides, for high blood pressure or if your body keeps too much water (water retention). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide: used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone \n(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nPioglitazone: oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some patients with \nlong-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with \npioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor immediately \nif you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or \nlocalised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nTresiba with alcohol \nIf you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change. Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall. \nYou should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIt is not known if Tresiba affects the baby in pregnancy or during breast-feeding. If you are pregnant \nor breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during \npregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. Avoiding too \nlow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the health of your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nHaving too low or too high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If \nyour blood sugar is too low or too high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This \ncould be dangerous to yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if: \n\u2022 you often get too low blood sugar \n\u2022 you find it hard to recognise too low blood sugar. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Tresiba \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Tresiba  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure. \n \nIf you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen \nwithout help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch pre-filled \npen. \n \nTresiba in a pre-filled pen is available in two strengths. \u201cTresiba 100 units/mL\u201d or \u201cTresiba \n200 units/mL\u201d is clearly marked on the pen label and packaging. In addition, Tresiba 100 units/mL \npackaging and label are light green, and Tresiba 200 units/mL packaging and label are dark green with \nstriping with a red box highlighting the formulation strength. \n \nFor both strengths, the needed dose is dialled in units. The dose steps, however, differ between the two \nstrengths of Tresiba. \n \nThe pre-filled pen 100 units/mL can provide a dose of 1\u201380 units in one injection in steps of 1 unit. \nThe dose counter of the pre-filled pen shows the number of units of insulin to be injected. Do not \nmake any dose re-calculation.  \n \nYour doctor will decide together with you:  \n\u2022 how much Tresiba you will need each day \n\u2022 when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose. \n \nFlexibility in dosing time \n\u2022 Always follow your doctor\u2019s recommendation for dose. \n\u2022 Use Tresiba once each day, preferably at the same time every day. \n\u2022 On occasions when it is not possible to take Tresiba at the same time of the day, it can be taken \n\nat a different time of day. Make sure to have a minimum of 8 hours between the doses. There is \nno experience with flexibility in dosing time of Tresiba in children and adolescents. \n\n\u2022 If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a \nchange in diet may alter your need for insulin. \n\n \nBased on your blood sugar level, your doctor may change your dose. \n \nWhen using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nUse in elderly (\u226565 years old) \nTresiba can be used in elderly, but if you are elderly, you may need to check your blood sugar level \nmore often. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems \nIf you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk \nto your doctor about changes in your dose. \n \nInjecting your medicine  \nBefore you use Tresiba for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the pre-filled \npen. \n\u2022 Check the name and strength on the label of the pen to make sure it is Tresiba 100 units/mL. \n \nDo not use Tresiba  \n\u2022 in insulin infusion pumps. \n\u2022 if the pen is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5). \n\u2022 if the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. \n \nHow to inject \n\u2022 Tresiba is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Do not inject it into a \n\nvein or muscle. \n\u2022 The best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist \n\n(abdomen). \n\u2022 Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing \n\nlumps and skin pitting (see section 4). \n\u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked \n\nneedles leading to inaccurate dosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. \n\u2022 Do not use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential \n\noverdose. \n \nDetailed instructions for use are provided on the other side of this leaflet. \n \nIf you use more Tresiba than you should \nIf you use too much insulin, your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section \n4 \u2018Too low blood sugar\u2019. \n \nIf you forget to use Tresiba \nIf you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of \n8 hours between doses. If you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your \nnext regular scheduled dose, do not inject a double dose, but resume your once-daily dosing schedule. \n \nIf you stop using Tresiba \nDo not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin, this could \nlead to a very high blood sugar level and ketoacidosis (a condition with too much acid in the blood), \nsee advice in section 4 \u2018Too high blood sugar\u2019. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nHypoglycaemia (too low blood sugar) may occur very commonly with insulin treatment (may affect \nmore than 1 in 10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much, you may \nbecome unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If \nyou have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. \nSee advice in \u2018Too low blood sugar\u2019 below. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nIf you have a serious allergic reaction (seen rarely) to the insulin or any of the ingredients in Tresiba, \nstop using this medicine and see a doctor straight away. The signs of a serious allergic reaction are: \n\u2022 the local reactions spread to other parts of your body \n\u2022 you suddenly feel unwell with sweating \n\u2022 you start being sick (vomiting) \n\u2022 you experience difficulty in breathing \n\u2022 you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy. \n \nSkin changes at the injection site: \nIf you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken \n(lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by \nbuild-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The \ninsulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the \ninjection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nLocal reactions: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs may include: \npain, redness, hives, swelling and itching. The reactions usually disappear after a few days. See your \ndoctor if they do not disappear after a few weeks. Stop using Tresiba and see a doctor straight away if \nthe reactions become serious. For more information, see \u2018serious allergic reaction\u2019 above. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nSwelling around your joints: When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep more \nwater than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is usually only \nshort-lasting. \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \nThis medicine can cause allergic reactions such as hives, swelling of the tongue and lips, diarrhoea, \nnausea, tiredness and itching. \n \nGeneral effects from diabetes treatment \n\u2022 Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) \n \nToo low blood sugar may happen if you: \ndrink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal. \n \nWarning signs of too low blood sugar \u2013 these may come on suddenly: \nHeadache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat, cool pale skin; feeling sick, feeling very hungry; \ntremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused, \ndifficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight. \n \nWhat to do if you get too low blood sugar \n\u2022 Eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always carry \n\nglucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). \n\u2022 Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. You may need to measure your blood sugar more \n\nthan once, as with all basal insulin products improvement from the period of low blood sugar \nmay be delayed.  \n\n\u2022 Wait until the signs of too low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has \nsettled. Then carry on with your insulin as usual. \n\n \nWhat others need to do if you pass out  \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. \n \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must: \n\n\n\n50 \n\n\u2022 turn you on your side \n\u2022 get medical help straight away \n\u2022 not give you any food or drink because you may choke. \n \nYou may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given \nby someone who knows how to use it. \n\u2022 If you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. \n\u2022 If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n\u2022 If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short \n\nor long-lasting. It may even cause death. \n \nTalk to your doctor if: \n\u2022 your blood sugar got so low that you passed out \n\u2022 you have used an injection of glucagon \n\u2022 you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently. \nThis is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be \nchanged. \n \n\u2022 Too high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nToo high blood sugar may happen if you: \neat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough \ninsulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin without \ntalking to your doctor. \n \nWarning signs of too high blood sugar \u2013 these normally appear gradually: \nFlushed, dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more often, \nfeeling thirsty; losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the \nblood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic \ncoma and eventually death. \n \nWhat to do if you get too high blood sugar \n\u2022 Test your blood sugar level. \n\u2022 Test your urine or blood for ketones. \n\u2022 Get medical help straight away. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Tresiba \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the pen label and carton, after \u2018EXP\u2019. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nBefore first use \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Keep away from the freezing element. Keep the cap \non the pen in order to protect it from light. \n \nAfter first opening or if carried as a spare \nYou can carry your Tresiba pre-filled pen (FlexTouch) with you and keep it at room temperature (not \nabove 30\u00b0C) or in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) for up to 8 weeks. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n51 \n\n \nAlways keep the cap on the pen when you are not using it in order to protect it from light.  \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Tresiba contains  \n\u2022 The active substance is insulin degludec. Each mL of solution contains 100 units of insulin \n\ndegludec. Each pre-filled pen contains 300 units of insulin degludec in 3 mL solution. \n \n\u2022 The other ingredients are glycerol, metacresol, phenol, zinc acetate, hydrochloric acid and \n\nsodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) and water for injections (see section 2). \n \nWhat Tresiba looks like and contents of the pack \nTresiba is presented as a clear and colourless solution for injection in a pre-filled pen (300 units per \n3 mL). \n \nPack sizes of 1 (with or without needles), 5 (without needles) and multipack of 10 (2 x 5) (without \nneedles) pre-filled pens of 3 mL. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder and Manufacturer \nNovo Nordisk A/S \nNovo All\u00e9  \nDK-2880 Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in  \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n52 \n\nInstructions on how to use Tresiba 100 units/mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n(FlexTouch)  \n \nPlease read these instructions carefully before using your FlexTouch pre-filled pen. If you do not \nfollow the instructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high \nor too low blood sugar level. \n \nDo not use the pen without proper training from your doctor or nurse. \nStart by checking your pen to make sure that it contains Tresiba 100 units/mL, then look at the \nillustrations below to get to know the different parts of your pen and needle. \n \nIf you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use \nthis pen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch \npre-filled pen. \n \nYour pen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen containing 300 units of insulin. You can select a \nmaximum of 80 units per dose, in steps of 1 unit. Your pen is designed to be used with NovoTwist \nor NovoFine single-use disposable needles up to a length of 8 mm.  \n \n\n Important information \nPay special attention to these notes as they are important for correct use of the pen. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \nTresiba pre-filled pen and \nneedle (example) \n(FlexTouch) \n\nPen cap Outer \nneedle cap \n\nInner \nneedle cap \n\nNeedle \n\nPaper tab \n\nInsulin scale \n\nInsulin window \n\nPen label \n\nDose counter \n\nDose pointer \n\nDose  \nselector \nDose  \nbutton \n\nT\nresiba\n\n \n            FlexTouch \n\nDose \nbutton \nwith \nsmooth \nsurface  \n\n \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n1 Prepare your pen \n \n\u2022 Check the name and strength on the label of your pen to make sure that it contains Tresiba \n\n100 units/mL. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take \na wrong type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. \n\n \n\u2022 Pull off the pen cap. \n \n\n \n\n A \n\n \n \n\u2022 Check that the insulin in your pen is clear and colourless. \n\nLook through the insulin window. If the insulin looks cloudy, do not use the pen. \n \n\n \n\n B \n\n \n \n\u2022 Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab. \n \n\n \n\n C \n\n \n \n\u2022 Push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn until it is on tight. \n \n\n \n\n D \n\n \n \n\u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it after the injection to \n\ncorrectly remove the needle from the pen. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n E \n\n \n \n\u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it back on, you may \n\naccidentally stick yourself with the needle. \n  \n\nA drop of insulin may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the \ninsulin flow. \n \n\n \n\n F \n\n \n \n\n Always use a new needle for each injection. \nThis reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and \ninaccurate dosing. \n\n \n Never use a bent or damaged needle. \n\n \n2 Check the insulin flow \n \n\u2022 Always check the insulin flow before you start. \n This helps you to ensure that you get your full insulin dose. \n \n\u2022 Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. Make sure the dose counter shows 2. \n \n\n \n\n A \n\n2 units \nselected \n\n \n \n\u2022 Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. \n\nTap the top of the pen gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. \n \n\n \n\n B \n\n \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\n\u2022 Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. \nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \nA drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. \n\n \n\n \n\n C \n\n \n \nA small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. \n \nIf no drop appears, repeat steps 2A to 2C up to 6 times. If there is still no drop, change the needle \nand repeat steps 2A to 2C once more. \n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a new one. \n \n\n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure \nthat the insulin flows. \n\n \nIf no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose counter may move. \nThis may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n \n\n Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little \ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level.  \n\n \n3 Select your dose \n \n\u2022 Make sure the dose counter shows 0 before you start. \n\nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \n \n\n\u2022 Turn the dose selector to select the dose you need, as directed by your doctor or nurse. \n \nIf you select a wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forwards or backwards to the correct dose. \n \nThe pen can dial up to a maximum of 80 units. \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n A \n\n5 units \nselected \n\nExamples \n\n24 units \nselected \n\n \n \nThe dose selector changes the number of units.

When your pen contains less than 80 units, the dose counter \nstops at the number of units left. \n \nThe dose selector clicks differently when turned forwards, backwards or past the number of units left. \nDo not count the pen clicks. \n \n\n Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many units you have selected \nbefore injecting the insulin. \nDo not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may \nget too high or too low. \nDo not use the insulin scale, it only shows approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \n \n\n4 Inject your dose \n \n\u2022 Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. \n \n\u2022 Make sure you can see the dose counter. \n\nDo not touch the dose counter with your fingers. This could interrupt the injection. \n \n\u2022 Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. \n\nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \nYou may then hear or feel a click. \n\n \n\u2022 Leave the needle under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you get your full dose. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\n A \n\n6 seconds \n\n \n \n\u2022 Pull the needle and pen straight up from your skin. \n\nIf blood appears at the injection site, press lightly with a cotton swab. Do not rub the area.  \n \n\n \n\n B \n\n \n \nYou may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your \ndose. \n \n\n Always watch the dose counter to know how many units you inject. \nThe dose counter will show the exact number of units. Do not count the pen clicks. Hold the \ndose button down until the dose counter returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose counter stops \nbefore it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood \nsugar level. \n\n \n5 After your injection \n \n\u2022 Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without \n\ntouching the needle or the outer needle cap. \n \n\n \n\n A \n\n \n \n\u2022 Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap completely on. \n \n\u2022 Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\n B \n\n \n \n\u2022 Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the insulin from light. \n \n\n \n\n C \n\n \n \nAlways dispose of the needle after each injection in an appropriate sharps container. This reduces \nthe risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. If the \nneedle is blocked, you will not inject any insulin. \n \nWhen the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed by your doctor, nurse, \npharmacist or local authorities. Do not place the used needle in household waste.  \n \n\n Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the \nneedle. \n\n \n Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle \n\nattached. \nThis reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and \ninaccurate dosing. \n\n \n6 How much insulin is left? \n \n\u2022 The insulin scale shows you approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \n \n\n \n\n A \n\nApprox. \nhow much \n\ninsulin is \nleft  \n\n \n\u2022 To see precisely how much insulin is left, use the dose counter: \n\nTurn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. \nIf it shows 80, at least 80 units are left in your pen. \nIf it shows less than 80, the number shown is the number of units left in your pen. \n\n \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n B \n\nDose \ncounter \n\nstopped: \n52 units \n\nleft \n\nExample \n\n \n \n\u2022 Turn the dose selector back until the dose counter shows 0. \n \n\u2022 If you need more insulin than the units left in your pen, you can split your dose between two \n\npens. \n \n\n Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose. \nIf in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose wrong, you will inject too \nlittle or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. \n\n \n Further important information \n\n \n\u2022 Always keep your pen with you. \n \n\u2022 Always carry an extra pen and new needles with you in case of loss or damage. \n \n\u2022 Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n \n\u2022 Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n \n\u2022 Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n \n\u2022 Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles to reduce the risk of needle \n\ninjury and cross-infection. \n \nCaring for your pen \n \nTreat your pen with care. Rough handling or misuse may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to \ntoo high or too low blood sugar level. \n \n\u2022 Do not leave the pen in a car or other place where it can get too hot or too cold. \n \n\u2022 Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt or liquid. \n \n\u2022 Do not wash, soak or lubricate your pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a \n\nmoistened cloth. \n \n\u2022 Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. \n If you drop it or suspect a problem, attach a new needle and check the insulin flow before you \n\ninject. \n \n\u2022 Do not try to refill your pen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n \n\u2022 Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nTresiba 200 units/mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen \ninsulin degludec \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2013 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2013 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\u2013 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2013 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Tresiba is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Tresiba \n3. How to use Tresiba \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Tresiba \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tresiba is and what it is used for \n \nTresiba is a long-acting basal insulin called insulin degludec. It is used to treat diabetes mellitus in \nadults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. Tresiba helps your body reduce your blood \nsugar level. It is used for once-daily dosing. On occasions when you cannot follow your regular dosing \nschedule, you can change the time of dosing because Tresiba has a long blood sugar-lowering effect \n(see section 3 for \u2018Flexibility in dosing time\u2019). Tresiba can be used with meal-related rapid-acting \ninsulin products. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba may be used in combination with tablets for \ndiabetes or with injectable antidiabetic medicines, other than insulin.  \nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba must always be used in combination with meal-related rapid-acting \ninsulin medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Tresiba \n \nDo not use Tresiba \n\u2022 if you are allergic to insulin degludec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tresiba. Be especially aware of the following: \n \n\u2022 Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) \u2013 if your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low \n\nblood sugar in section 4. \n\u2022 High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \u2013 if your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for \n\nhigh blood sugar in section 4. \n\u2022 Switching from other insulin medicines \u2013 the insulin dose may need to be changed if you switch \n\nfrom another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin. Talk to your doctor. \n\u2022 Pioglitazone used together with insulin, see \u2018Pioglitazone\u2019 below. \n\u2022 Eye disorder \u2013 fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of \n\ndiabetic eye disorder. If you experience eye problems, talk to your doctor. \n\u2022 Ensuring you use the right type of insulin \u2013 always check the insulin label before each injection \n\nto avoid accidental mix-ups between different strengths of Tresiba as well as other insulin \nproducts.  \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \nIf you have poor eyesight, please see section 3. \n \nSkin changes at the injection site \nThe injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as \nskin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you \ninject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 \u2018How to use Tresiba\u2019). Tell your doctor \nif you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into \nthese affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check \nyour blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTresiba can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. There is no experience with \nthe use of Tresiba in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and Tresiba \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, this may mean your insulin dose has to be \nchanged. \n \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n\u2022 other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable) \n\u2022 sulfonamides, for infections \n\u2022 anabolic steroids, such as testosterone \n\u2022 beta-blockers, for high blood pressure. They may make it harder to recognise the warning signs \n\nof too low blood sugar (see section 4 \u2018Warning signs of too low blood sugar\u2019) \n\u2022 acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates), for pain and mild fever \n\u2022 monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, for depression \n\u2022 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for some heart problems or high blood \n\npressure. \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n\u2022 danazol, for endometriosis \n\u2022 oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \n\u2022 thyroid hormones, for thyroid problems \n\u2022 growth hormone, for growth hormone deficiency \n\u2022 glucocorticoids such as \u2018cortisone\u2019, for inflammation \n\u2022 sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline, for asthma \n\u2022 thiazides, for high blood pressure or if your body keeps too much water (water retention). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide: used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone \n(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nPioglitazone: oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some patients with \nlong-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with \npioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor immediately \nif you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or \nlocalised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nTresiba with alcohol \nIf you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change. Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall. \nYou should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIt is not known if Tresiba affects the baby in pregnancy or during breast-feeding. If you are pregnant \nor breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during \npregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. Avoiding too \nlow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the health of your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nHaving too low or too high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If \nyour blood sugar is too low or too high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This \ncould be dangerous to yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if: \n\u2022 you often get too low blood sugar \n\u2022 you find it hard to recognise too low blood sugar. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Tresiba \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Tresiba  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure. \n \nIf you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen \nwithout help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch pre-filled \npen. \n \nTresiba in a pre-filled pen is available in two strengths. \u201cTresiba 100 units/mL\u201d or \u201cTresiba \n200 units/mL\u201d is clearly marked on the pen label and packaging. In addition, Tresiba 100 units/mL \npackaging and label are light green, and Tresiba 200 units/mL packaging and label are dark green with \nstriping with a red box highlighting the formulation strength. \n \nFor both strengths, the needed dose is dialled in units. The dose steps, however, differ between the two \nstrengths of Tresiba.  \n \nThe pre-filled pen 200 units/mL can provide a dose of 2\u2013160 units in one injection in steps of 2 units. \nThe dose counter of the pre-filled pen shows the number of units of insulin to be injected. Do not \nmake any dose re-calculation.  \n \nYour doctor will decide together with you: \n\u2022 how much Tresiba you will need each day \n\u2022 when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose. \n \nFlexibility in dosing time \n\u2022 Always follow your doctor\u2019s recommendation for dose. \n\u2022 Use Tresiba once each day, preferably at the same time every day. \n\u2022 On occasions when it is not possible to take Tresiba at the same time of the day, it can be taken \n\nat a different time of day. Make sure to have a minimum of 8 hours between the doses. There is \nno experience with flexibility in dosing time of Tresiba in children and adolescents. \n\n\u2022 If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a \nchange in diet may alter your need for insulin. \n\n \nBased on your blood sugar level, your doctor may change your dose. \n \nWhen using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\nUse in elderly (\u226565 years old) \nTresiba can be used in elderly, but if you are elderly, you may need to check your blood sugar level \nmore often. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems \nIf you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk \nto your doctor about changes in your dose. \n \nInjecting your medicine  \nBefore you use Tresiba for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the pre-filled \npen. \n\u2022 Check the name and strength on the label of the pen to make sure it is Tresiba 200 units/mL. \n\u2022 The dose counter of your pen shows the exact number of insulin units. Do not make any dose \n\nre-calculation. \n \nDo not use Tresiba  \n\u2022 in insulin infusion pumps. \n\u2022 if the pen is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5 \u2018How to store Tresiba\u2019). \n\u2022 if the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. \n \nHow to inject \n\u2022 Tresiba is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Do not inject it into a \n\nvein or muscle. \n\u2022 The best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist \n\n(abdomen). \n\u2022 Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing \n\nlumps and skin pitting (see section 4). \n\u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked \n\nneedles leading to inaccurate dosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. \n\u2022 Do not use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential \n\noverdose. \n \nDetailed instructions for use are provided on the other side of this leaflet. \n \nIf you use more Tresiba than you should \nIf you use too much insulin, your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section \n4 \u2018Too low blood sugar\u2019. \n \nIf you forget to use Tresiba \nIf you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of \n8 hours between doses. If you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your \nnext regular scheduled dose, do not inject a double dose, but resume your once-daily dosing schedule. \n \nIf you stop using Tresiba \nDo not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin, this could \nlead to a very high blood sugar level and ketoacidosis (a condition with too much acid in the blood), \nsee advice in section 4 \u2018Too high blood sugar\u2019. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nHypoglycaemia (too low blood sugar) may occur very commonly with insulin treatment (may affect \nmore than 1 in 10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much, you may \nbecome unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If \n\n\n\n65 \n\nyou have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. \nSee advice in \u2018Too low blood sugar\u2019 below. \n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction (seen rarely) to the insulin or any of the ingredients in Tresiba, \nstop using this medicine and see a doctor straight away. The signs of a serious allergic reaction are: \n\u2022 the local reactions spread to other parts of your body \n\u2022 you suddenly feel unwell with sweating \n\u2022 you start being sick (vomiting) \n\u2022 you experience difficulty in breathing \n\u2022 you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy. \n \nSkin changes at the injection site: \nIf you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken \n(lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by \nbuild-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The \ninsulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the \ninjection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nLocal reactions: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs may include: \npain, redness, hives, swelling and itching. The reactions usually disappear after a few days. See your \ndoctor if they do not disappear after a few weeks. Stop using Tresiba and see a doctor straight away if \nthe reactions become serious. For more information, see \u2018serious allergic reaction\u2019 above. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nSwelling around your joints: When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep more \nwater than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is usually only \nshort-lasting. \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \nThis medicine can cause allergic reactions such as hives, swelling of the tongue and lips, diarrhoea, \nnausea, tiredness and itching. \n \nGeneral effects from diabetes treatment \n\u2022 Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) \n \nToo low blood sugar may happen if you: \ndrink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal. \n \nWarning signs of too low blood sugar \u2013 these may come on suddenly: \nHeadache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat, cool pale skin; feeling sick, feeling very hungry; \ntremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused, \ndifficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight. \n \nWhat to do if you get too low blood sugar \n\u2022 Eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always carry \n\nglucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). \n\u2022 Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. You may need to measure your blood sugar more \n\nthan once, as with all basal insulin products improvement from the period of low blood sugar \nmay be delayed.  \n\n\u2022 Wait until the signs of too low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has \nsettled. Then carry on with your insulin as usual. \n\n \nWhat others need to do if you pass out  \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \n\n\n\n66 \n\nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. \n \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must: \n\u2022 turn you on your side \n\u2022 get medical help straight away \n\u2022 not give you any food or drink because you may choke. \n \nYou may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given \nby someone who knows how to use it. \n\u2022 If you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. \n\u2022 If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n\u2022 If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short \n\nor long-lasting. It may even cause death. \n \nTalk to your doctor if: \n\u2022 your blood sugar got so low that you passed out \n\u2022 you have used an injection of glucagon \n\u2022 you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently. \nThis is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be \nchanged. \n \n\u2022 Too high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nToo high blood sugar may happen if you: \neat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough \ninsulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin without \ntalking to your doctor. \n \nWarning signs of too high blood sugar \u2013 these normally appear gradually: \nFlushed, dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more often, \nfeeling thirsty; losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the \nblood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic \ncoma and eventually death. \n \nWhat to do if you get too high blood sugar \n\u2022 Test your blood sugar level. \n\u2022 Test your urine or blood for ketones. \n\u2022 Get medical help straight away. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

Your pen is designed to be used with \nNovoTwist or NovoFine single-use disposable needles up to a length of 8 mm.  \n \n\n Important information \n Pay special attention to these notes as they are important for correct use of the pen. \n \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\nPen cap \n\nTresiba pre-filled pen and  \nneedle (example) \n(FlexTouch) \n\nInsulin scale \n\nInsulin window \n\nPen label \n\nDose counter \n\nDose pointer \n\nDose  \nselector \nDose  \nbutton \n\nOuter \nneedle cap \n\nInner \nneedle cap \n\nNeedle \n\nPaper tab \n\nT\nresiba\n\n \n                      FlexTouch\n\n \n\nDose \nbutton \nwith  \n2 dots \nindicates  \n2 units per \nstep \n\n \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n1 Prepare your pen \n \n\u2022 Check the name and strength on the label of your pen to make sure that it contains Tresiba \n\n200 units/mL. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take \na wrong type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. \n\n \n\u2022 Pull off the pen cap. \n \n\n \n\n A \n\n \n \n\u2022 Check that the insulin in your pen is clear and colourless. \n\nLook through the insulin window. If the insulin looks cloudy, do not use the pen. \n \n\n \n\n B \n\n \n \n\u2022 Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab. \n \n\n \n\n C \n\n \n \n\u2022 Push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn until it is on tight. \n \n\n \n\n D \n\n \n \n\u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it after the injection to \n\ncorrectly remove the needle from the pen. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n E \n\n  \n \n\u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it back on, you may \n\naccidentally stick yourself with the needle. \n \n\nA drop of insulin may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the \ninsulin flow. \n\n \n\n \n\n F \n\n \n \n\n Always use a new needle for each injection. \nThis reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and \ninaccurate dosing. \n\n \n Never use a bent or damaged needle. \n\n \n2 Check the insulin flow \n \n\u2022 Always check the insulin flow before you start.  \n\nThis helps you to ensure that you get your full insulin dose. \n \n\u2022 Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. Make sure the dose counter shows 2. \n \n \n\n \n\n A \n\n2 units \nselected \n\n \n \n\u2022 Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. \n\nTap the top of the pen gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. \n \n\n \n\n B \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\u2022 Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. \n\nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \nA drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. \n\n \n\n \n\n C \n\n \n \nA small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. \n \nIf no drop appears, repeat steps 2A to 2C up to 6 times. If there is still no drop, change the needle \nand repeat steps 2A to 2C once more. \n \nIf a drop of insulin still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a new one. \n \n\n Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure \nthat the insulin flows. \n\n \nIf no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose counter may move. \nThis may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. \n \n\n Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little \ninsulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. \n\n \n3 Select your dose \n \n\u2022 Make sure the dose counter shows 0 before you start. \n\nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \n \n\n\u2022 Turn the dose selector to select the dose you need, as directed by your doctor or nurse.  \n \n\u2022 The dose counter shows the dose dialled in units. Do not make any dose re-calculation. \n \nIf you select a wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forwards or backwards to the correct dose. \n \nThe pen can dial up to a maximum of 160 units. \n \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n A \n\n6 units \nselected \n\nExamples \n\n24 units \nselected \n\n \n \nThe dose selector changes the number of units. Only the dose counter and dose pointer will show how \nmany units you select per dose. \n \nYou can select up to 160 units per dose. When your pen contains less than 160 units, the dose counter \nstops at the number of units left. \n\n \nThe dose selector clicks differently when turned forwards, backwards or past the number of units left. \nDo not count the pen clicks. \n \n\n Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many units you have selected \nbefore injecting the insulin. \nDo not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may \nget too high or too low. \nDo not use the insulin scale, it only shows approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \n\n \n4 Inject your dose \n \n\u2022 Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. \n \n\u2022 Make sure you can see the dose counter. \n\nDo not touch the dose counter with your fingers. This could interrupt the injection. \n \n\u2022 Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. \n\nThe 0 must line up with the dose pointer. \nYou may then hear or feel a click. \n\n \n\u2022 Leave the needle under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you get your full dose. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n A \n\n6 seconds \n\n \n \n\u2022 Pull the needle and pen straight up from your skin. \n\nIf blood appears at the injection site, press lightly with a cotton swab. Do not rub the area. \n \n\n \n\n B \n\n \n \nYou may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your \ndose. \n \n\n Always watch the dose counter to know how many units you inject. \nThe dose counter will show the exact number of units. Do not count the pen clicks. Hold the \ndose button down until the dose counter returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose counter stops \nbefore it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood \nsugar level. \n\n \n5 After your injection \n \n\u2022 Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without \n\ntouching the needle or the outer needle cap. \n \n\n \n\n A \n\n \n \n\u2022 Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap completely on. \n \n\u2022 Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\n B \n\n \n \n\u2022 Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the insulin from light. \n \n\n \n\n C \n\n \n \nAlways dispose of the needle after each injection in an appropriate sharps container. This reduces \nthe risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. If the \nneedle is blocked, you will not inject any insulin. \n \nWhen the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed by your doctor, nurse, \npharmacist or local authorities. Do not place the used needle in household waste.  \n \n\n Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the \nneedle. \n\n \n Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle \n\nattached.  \n \n\nThis reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and \ninaccurate dosing. \n\n \n6 How much insulin is left? \n \n\u2022 The insulin scale shows you approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. \n \n\n \n\n A \n\nApprox. \nhow much \n\ninsulin is \nleft \n\n \n \n\u2022 To see precisely how much insulin is left, use the dose counter: \n\nTurn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. \nIf it shows 160, at least 160 units are left in your pen. \nIf it shows less than 160, the number shown is the number of units left in your pen. \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n B \n\nDose \ncounter \n\nstopped: \n52 units \n\nleft \n\nExample \n\n \n \n\u2022 Turn the dose selector back until the dose counter shows 0. \n \n\u2022 If you need more insulin than the units left in your pen, you can split your dose between two \n\npens. \n \n\n Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose. \nIf in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose wrong, you will inject too \nlittle or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. \n\n \n Further important information \n\n \n\u2022 Always keep your pen with you. \n \n\u2022 Always carry an extra pen and new needles with you in case of loss or damage. \n \n\u2022 Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. \n \n\u2022 Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. \n \n\u2022 Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. \n \n\u2022 Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles to reduce the risk of needle \n\ninjury and cross-infection. \n \nCaring for your pen \n \nTreat your pen with care. Rough handling or misuse may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to \ntoo high or too low blood sugar level. \n \n\u2022 Do not leave the pen in a car or other place where it can get too hot or too cold. \n \n\u2022 Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt or liquid. \n \n\u2022 Do not wash, soak or lubricate your pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a \n\nmoistened cloth. \n \n\u2022 Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. \n If you drop it or suspect a problem, attach a new needle and check the insulin flow before you \n\ninject. \n \n\u2022 Do not try to refill your pen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. \n \n\u2022 Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart. \n\n\n\n77 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nTresiba 100 units/mL solution for injection in cartridge \ninsulin degludec \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2013 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2013 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\u2013 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2013 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Tresiba is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Tresiba \n3. How to use Tresiba \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Tresiba \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tresiba is and what it is used for \n \nTresiba is a long-acting basal insulin called insulin degludec. It is used to treat diabetes mellitus in \nadults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. Tresiba helps your body reduce your blood \nsugar level. It is used for once-daily dosing. On occasions when you cannot follow your regular dosing \nschedule, you can change the time of dosing because Tresiba has a long blood sugar-lowering effect \n(see section 3 for \u2018Flexibility in dosing time\u2019). Tresiba can be used with meal-related rapid-acting \ninsulin products. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba may be used in combination with tablets for \ndiabetes or with injectable antidiabetic medicines, other than insulin.  \nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba must always be used in combination with meal-related rapid-acting \ninsulin medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Tresiba \n \nDo not use Tresiba \n\u2022 if you are allergic to insulin degludec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tresiba. Be especially aware of the following: \n \n\u2022 Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) \u2013 if your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low \n\nblood sugar in section 4. \n\u2022 High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \u2013 if your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for \n\nhigh blood sugar in section 4. \n\u2022 Switching from other insulin medicines \u2013 the insulin dose may need to be changed if you switch \n\nfrom another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin. Talk to your doctor. \n\u2022 Pioglitazone used together with insulin, see \u2018Pioglitazone\u2019 below. \n\u2022 Eye disorder \u2013 fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of \n\ndiabetic eye disorder. If you experience eye problems, talk to your doctor. \n\u2022 Ensuring you use the right type of insulin \u2013 always check the insulin label before each injection \n\nto avoid accidental mix-ups between Tresiba and other insulin products.  \n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nIf you have poor eyesight, please see section 3. \n \nSkin changes at the injection site \nThe injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as \nskin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you \ninject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 \u2018How to use Tresiba\u2019). Tell your doctor \nif you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into \nthese affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check \nyour blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTresiba can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. There is no experience with \nthe use of Tresiba in children below the age of 1 year. \n \nOther medicines and Tresiba \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, this may mean your insulin dose has to be \nchanged. \n \nListed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n\u2022 other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable) \n\u2022 sulfonamides, for infections \n\u2022 anabolic steroids, such as testosterone \n\u2022 beta-blockers, for high blood pressure. They may make it harder to recognise the warning signs \n\nof too low blood sugar (see section 4 \u2018Warning signs of too low blood sugar\u2019) \n\u2022 acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates), for pain and mild fever \n\u2022 monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, for depression \n\u2022 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for some heart problems or high blood \n\npressure. \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n\u2022 danazol, for endometriosis \n\u2022 oral contraceptives (birth control pills) \n\u2022 thyroid hormones, for thyroid problems \n\u2022 growth hormone, for growth hormone deficiency \n\u2022 glucocorticoids such as \u2018cortisone\u2019, for inflammation \n\u2022 sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline, for asthma \n\u2022 thiazides, for high blood pressure or if your body keeps too much water (water retention). \n \nOctreotide and lanreotide: used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone \n(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. \n \nPioglitazone: oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some patients with \nlong-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with \npioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor immediately \nif you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or \nlocalised swelling (oedema). \n \nIf any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nTresiba with alcohol \nIf you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change. Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall. \nYou should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n\n\n79 \n\nIt is not known if Tresiba affects the baby in pregnancy or during breast-feeding. If you are pregnant \nor breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be changed during \npregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. Avoiding too \nlow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the health of your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nHaving too low or too high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If \nyour blood sugar is too low or too high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This \ncould be dangerous to yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if: \n\u2022 you often get too low blood sugar \n\u2022 you find it hard to recognise too low blood sugar. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Tresiba \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Tresiba  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure. \n \nIf you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this \ninsulin product without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pen. \n \nYour doctor will decide together with you: \n\u2022 how much Tresiba you will need each day \n\u2022 when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose. \n \nFlexibility in dosing time \n\u2022 Always follow your doctor\u2019s recommendation for dose. \n\u2022 Use Tresiba once each day, preferably at the same time every day. \n\u2022 On occasions when it is not possible to take Tresiba at the same time of the day, it can be taken \n\nat a different time of day. Make sure to have a minimum of 8 hours between the doses. There is \nno experience with flexibility in dosing time of Tresiba in children and adolescents. \n\n\u2022 If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a \nchange in diet may alter your need for insulin. \n\n \nBased on your blood sugar level, your doctor may change your dose. \n \nWhen using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted. \n \nUse in elderly (\u226565 years old) \nTresiba can be used in elderly, but if you are elderly, you may need to check your blood sugar level \nmore often. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems \nIf you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk \nto your doctor about changes in your dose. \n \nInjecting your medicine  \nBefore you use Tresiba for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use it. \n\u2022 Please also read the manual that comes with your insulin delivery system. \n\u2022 Check the name and strength on the label to make sure it is Tresiba 100 units/mL. \n \nDo not use Tresiba  \n\n\n\n80 \n\n\u2022 in insulin infusion pumps. \n\u2022 if the cartridge or the delivery system you are using is damaged. Take it back to your supplier. \n\nSee your delivery system manual for further instructions. \n\u2022 if the cartridge is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5 \u2018How to store \n\nTresiba\u2019). \n\u2022 if the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. \n \nHow to inject \n\u2022 Tresiba is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Do not inject it into a \n\nvein or muscle. \n\u2022 The best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist \n\n(abdomen). \n\u2022 Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing \n\nlumps and skin pitting (see section 4). \n\u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked \n\nneedles leading to inaccurate dosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. \n \n \nIf you use more Tresiba than you should \nIf you use too much insulin, your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section \n4 \u2018Too low blood sugar\u2019. \n \nIf you forget to use Tresiba \nIf you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of \n8 hours between doses. If you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your \nnext regular scheduled dose, do not inject a double dose, but resume your once-daily dosing schedule. \n \nIf you stop using Tresiba \nDo not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin, this could \nlead to a very high blood sugar level and ketoacidosis (a condition with too much acid in the blood), \nsee advice in section 4 \u2018Too high blood sugar\u2019. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nHypoglycaemia (too low blood sugar) may occur very commonly with insulin treatment (may affect \nmore than 1 in 10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much, you may \nbecome unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If \nyou have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. \nSee advice in \u2018Too low blood sugar\u2019 below. \n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction (seen rarely) to the insulin or any of the ingredients in Tresiba, \nstop using Tresiba and see a doctor straight away. The signs of a serious allergic reaction are: \n\u2022 the local reactions spread to other parts of your body \n\u2022 you suddenly feel unwell with sweating \n\u2022 you start being sick (vomiting) \n\u2022 you experience difficulty in breathing \n\u2022 you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy. \n \nSkin changes at the injection site: \nIf you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken \n(lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by \nbuild-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The \ninsulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the \ninjection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nLocal reactions: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs may include: \npain, redness, hives, swelling and itching. The reactions usually disappear after a few days. See your \ndoctor if they do not disappear after a few weeks. Stop using Tresiba and see a doctor straight away if \nthe reactions become serious. For more information, see \u2018serious allergic reaction\u2019 above. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nSwelling around your joints: When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep more \nwater than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is usually only \nshort-lasting. \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \nThis medicine can cause allergic reactions such as hives, swelling of the tongue and lips, diarrhoea, \nnausea, tiredness and itching. \n \nGeneral effects from diabetes treatment \n\u2022 Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) \n \nToo low blood sugar may happen if you: \ndrink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal. \n \nWarning signs of too low blood sugar \u2013 these may come on suddenly: \nHeadache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat, cool pale skin; feeling sick, feeling very hungry; \ntremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused, \ndifficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight. \n \nWhat to do if you get too low blood sugar \n\u2022 Eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always carry \n\nglucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). \n\u2022 Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. You may need to measure your blood sugar more \n\nthan once, as with all basal insulin products improvement from the period of low blood sugar \nmay be delayed.  \n\n\u2022 Wait until the signs of too low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has \nsettled. Then carry on with your insulin as usual. \n\n \nWhat others need to do if you pass out  \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. \n \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must: \n\u2022 turn you on your side \n\u2022 get medical help straight away \n\u2022 not give you any food or drink because you may choke. \n \nYou may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given \nby someone who knows how to use it. \n\u2022 If you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. \n\u2022 If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital. \n\u2022 If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short \n\nor long-lasting. It may even cause death. \n \nTalk to your doctor if: \n\u2022 your blood sugar got so low that you passed out \n\u2022 you have used an injection of glucagon \n\n\n\n82 \n\n\u2022 you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently. \nThis is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be \nchanged. \n \n\u2022 Too high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \n \nToo high blood sugar may happen if you: \neat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough \ninsulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin without \ntalking to your doctor. \n \nWarning signs of too high blood sugar \u2013 these normally appear gradually: \nFlushed, dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more often, \nfeeling thirsty; losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \nThese may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the \nblood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic \ncoma and eventually death. \n \nWhat to do if you get too high blood sugar \n\u2022 Test your blood sugar level. \n\u2022 Test your urine or blood for ketones. \n\u2022 Get medical help straight away. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

regular dosing schedule, you can change the time of dosing because tresiba has a long blood sugar-lowering effect (see section 3 for 'flexibility in dosing time'). tresiba can be used with meal-related rapid-acting insulin products. in type 2 diabetes mellitus, tresiba may be used in combination with tablets for diabetes or with injectable antidiabetic medicines, other than insulin. in

not use tresiba if you are allergic to insulin degludec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using tresiba. be especially aware of the following: low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) if your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low blood sugar in section 4. high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) if your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for high blood sugar in section 4. switching from other insulin medicines the insulin dose may need to be changed if you switch from another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin. talk to your doctor. pioglitazone used together with insulin, see 'pioglitazone' below. eye disorder fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of diabetic eye disorder. if you experience eye problems, talk to your doctor. ensuring you use the right type of insulin always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between different strengths of tresiba as well as other insulin products. if you have poor eyesight, please see section 3. skin changes at the injection site the injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. the insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 'how to use tresiba'). tell your doctor if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. children and adolescents tresiba can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. there is no experience with the use of tresiba in children below the age of 1 year. other medicines and tresiba tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. some medicines affect your blood sugar level, this may mean your insulin dose has to be changed. listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable) sulfonamides, for infections anabolic steroids, such as testosterone beta-blockers, for high blood pressure. they may make it harder to recognise the warning signs of too low blood sugar (see section 4 'warning signs of too low blood sugar') acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates), for pain and mild fever monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors, for depression angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, for some heart problems or high blood pressure. your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: danazol, for endometriosis oral contraceptives (birth control pills) thyroid hormones, for thyroid problems growth hormone, for growth hormone deficiency glucocorticoids such as 'cortisone', for inflammation sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline, for asthma thiazides, for high blood pressure or if your body keeps too much water (water retention). octreotide and lanreotide: used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone (acromegaly). they may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. pioglitazone: oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. inform your doctor immediately if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). if any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. tresiba with alcohol if you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change. your blood sugar level may either rise or fall. you should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. pregnancy and breast-feeding it is not known if tresiba affects the baby in pregnancy or during breast-feeding. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. your insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. careful control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. avoiding too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the health of your baby. driving and using machines having too low or too high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. if your blood sugar is too low or too high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. this could be dangerous to yourself or others. ask your doctor whether you can drive if: you often get too low blood sugar you find it hard to recognise too low blood sugar. important information about some of the ingredients of tresiba this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. this means that the medicine is essentially 'sodium-free'.",

"3. how to use tresiba", "Section_Content": "always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. if you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen without help. get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the flextouch pre-filled pen. tresiba in a pre-filled pen is available in two strengths. \"tresiba 100 units/ml\" or \"tresiba 200 units/ml\" is clearly marked on the pen label and packaging. in addition, tresiba 100 units/ml packaging and label are light green, and tresiba 200 units/ml packaging and label are dark green with striping with a red box highlighting the formulation strength. for both strengths, the needed dose is dialled in units. the dose steps, however, differ between the two strengths of tresiba. the pre-filled pen 100 units/ml can provide a dose of 180 units in one injection in steps of 1 unit. the dose counter of the pre-filled pen shows the number of units of insulin to be injected. do not make any dose re-calculation. your doctor will decide together with you: how much tresiba you will need each day when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose. flexibility in dosing time always follow your doctor's recommendation for dose. use tresiba once each day, preferably at the same time every day. on occasions when it is not possible to take tresiba at the same time of the day, it can be taken at a different time of day. make sure to have a minimum of 8 hours between the doses. there is no experience with flexibility in dosing time of tresiba in children and adolescents. if you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a change in diet may alter your need for insulin. based on your blood sugar level, your doctor may change your dose. when using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted. use in elderly (\u226565 years old) tresiba can be used in elderly, but if you are elderly, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. if you have kidney or liver problems if you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. injecting your medicine before you use tresiba for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the pre-filled pen. check the name and strength on the label of the pen to make sure it is tresiba 100 units/ml. do not use tresiba in insulin infusion pumps. if the pen is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5). if the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. how to inject tresiba is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). do not inject it into a vein or muscle. the best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist (abdomen). change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing lumps and skin pitting (see section 4). always use a new needle for each injection. re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked needles leading to inaccurate dosing. dispose of the needle safely after each use. do not use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential overdose. detailed instructions for use are provided on the other side of this leaflet. if you use more tresiba than you should if you use too much insulin, your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section 4 'too low blood sugar'. if you forget to use tresiba if you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of 8 hours between doses. if you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your next regular scheduled dose, do not inject a double dose, but resume your once-daily dosing schedule. if you stop using tresiba do not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. if you stop using your insulin, this could lead to a very high blood sugar level and ketoacidosis (a condition with too much acid in the blood), see advice in section 4 'too high blood sugar'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "tresiba", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,

hypoglycaemia (too low blood sugar) may occur very commonly with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). it can be very serious. if your blood sugar level falls too much, you may become unconscious. serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. if you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. see advice in 'too low blood sugar' below. if you have a serious allergic reaction (seen rarely) to the insulin or any of the ingredients in tresiba, stop using this medicine and see a doctor straight away. the signs of a serious allergic reaction are: the local reactions spread to other parts of your body you suddenly feel unwell with sweating you start being sick (vomiting) you experience difficulty in breathing you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy. skin changes at the injection site: if you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). the insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. other side effects include: common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) local reactions: local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. the signs may include: pain, redness, hives, swelling and itching. the reactions usually disappear after a few days. see your doctor if they do not disappear after a few weeks. stop using tresiba and see a doctor straight away if the reactions become serious. for more information, see 'serious allergic reaction' above. uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) swelling around your joints: when you first start using your medicine, your body may keep more water than it should. this causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. this is usually only short-lasting. rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) this medicine can cause allergic reactions such as hives, swelling of the tongue and lips, diarrhoea, nausea, tiredness and itching. general effects from diabetes treatment too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) too low blood sugar may happen if you: drink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal. warning signs of too low blood sugar these may come on suddenly: headache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat, cool pale skin; feeling sick, feeling very hungry; tremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused, difficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight. what to do if you get too low blood sugar eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always carry glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. you may need to measure your blood sugar more than once, as with all basal insulin products improvement from the period of low blood sugar may be delayed. wait until the signs of too low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has settled. then carry on with your insulin as usual. what others need to do if you pass out tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. tell them what could happen if your blood sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. let them know that if you pass out, they must: 50 turn you on your side get medical help straight away not give you any food or drink because you may choke. you may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. this can only be given by someone who knows how to use it. if you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. if you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital. if severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. this can be short or long-lasting. it may even cause death. talk to your doctor if: your blood sugar got so low that you passed out you have used an injection of glucagon you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently. this is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be changed. too high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) too high blood sugar may happen if you: eat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough insulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin without talking to your doctor. warning signs of too high blood sugar these normally appear gradually: flushed, dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more often, feeling thirsty; losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). these may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. this is a build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. if not treated, this could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death. what to do if you get too high blood sugar test your blood sugar level. test your urine or blood for ketones. get medical help straight away. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition":
