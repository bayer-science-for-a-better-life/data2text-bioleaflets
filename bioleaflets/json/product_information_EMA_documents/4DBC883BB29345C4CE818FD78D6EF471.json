NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFLUENZ nasal spray suspension \nInfluenza vaccine (live attenuated, nasal) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nReassortant influenza virus* (live attenuated) of the following strains**: \n \nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like strain \n(A/California/7/2009, MEDI 228029) 107.0±0.5 FFU*** \n \nA/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like strain \n(A/Texas/50/2012, MEDI 237514) 107.0±0.5 FFU*** \n \nB/Massachusetts/2/2012-like strain \n(B/Massachusetts/2/2012, MEDI 237751) 107.0±0.5 FFU*** \n \n.......................................................................................................per 0.2 ml dose \n \n* propagated in fertilised hens’ eggs from healthy chicken flocks. \n** produced in VERO cells by reverse genetic technology. This product contains genetically \n\nmodified organisms (GMOs). \n*** fluorescent focus units \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation (Northern Hemisphere) and EU decision \nfor the 2013/2014 season. \n \nThe vaccine may contain residues of the following substances: egg proteins (e.g. ovalbumin) \nand gentamicin. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nNasal spray, suspension \n \nThe suspension is colourless to pale yellow, clear to opalescent. Small white particles may be present. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in individuals 24 months to less than 18 years of age. \n \nThe use of FLUENZ should be based on official recommendations. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nChildren and adolescents from 24 months: \n0.2 ml (administered as 0.1 ml per nostril). \n \nFor children who have not previously been vaccinated against seasonal influenza, a second dose \nshould be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks. \n \nFLUENZ should not be used in infants and toddlers below 24 months of age because of safety \nconcerns (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation must be carried out by nasal administration. \n \nDO NOT INJECT FLUENZ. \n \nSee section 6.6 for administration instructions. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (e.g. gelatin), \nor to gentamicin (a possible trace residue), eggs or egg proteins (e.g. ovalbumin). \n \nChildren and adolescents who are clinically immunodeficient due to conditions or immunosuppressive \ntherapy such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; lymphoma; symptomatic HIV infection; cellular \nimmune deficiencies; and high-dose corticosteroids. FLUENZ is not contraindicated for use in \nindividuals with asymptomatic HIV infection; or individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled \ncorticosteroids or low-dose systemic corticosteroids or those receiving corticosteroids as \nreplacement therapy, e.g. for adrenal insufficiency. \n \nChildren and adolescents younger than 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy because \nof the association of Reye’s syndrome with salicylates and wild-type influenza infection. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs with most vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of FLUENZ. \n \nFLUENZ should not be administered to children and adolescents with severe asthma or active \nwheezing because these individuals have not been adequately studied in clinical studies. \n \nDo not administer FLUENZ to infants and toddlers younger than 12 months. In a clinical study, \nan increase in hospitalisations was observed in infants and toddlers younger than 12 months \nafter vaccination (see section 4.8). It is not recommended to administer FLUENZ to infants \nand toddlers 12-23 months of age. In a clinical study, an increased rate of wheezing was \nobserved in infants and toddlers 12-23 months of age after vaccination (see section 4.8). \n \nVaccine recipients should be informed that FLUENZ is an attenuated live virus vaccine and has \nthe potential for transmission to immunocompromised contacts. Vaccine recipients should attempt \nto avoid, whenever possible, close association with severely immunocompromised individuals \n(e.g. bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for 1-2 weeks following vaccination. \nPeak incidence of vaccine virus recovery occurred 2-3 days post-vaccination in clinical studies. \nIn circumstances where contact with severely immunocompromised individuals is unavoidable, \nthe potential risk of transmission of the influenza vaccine virus should be weighed against the \nrisk of acquiring and transmitting wild-type influenza virus. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nFLUENZ should under no circumstances be injected. \n \nNo data exist regarding the safety of intranasal administration of FLUENZ in children with unrepaired \ncraniofacial malformations. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDo not administer FLUENZ to children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age receiving \nsalicylate therapy (see section 4.3). Do not use salicylates in children and adolescents younger \nthan 18 years of age for 4 weeks after vaccination unless medically indicated as Reye’s syndrome \nhas been reported following the use of salicylates during wild-type influenza infection. \n \nThe co-administration of FLUENZ with the live attenuated vaccines: measles, mumps, rubella, \nvaricella, and orally-administered poliovirus has been studied. No clinically meaningful changes in \nimmune responses to measles, mumps, varicella, orally-administered poliovirus or FLUENZ have \nbeen observed. The immune response to rubella vaccine was significantly altered. However, this \nalteration might not be of clinical relevance with the two dose immunisation schedule of the rubella \nvaccine. \n \nThe co-administration of FLUENZ with inactivated vaccines has not been studied. \n \nThe concurrent use of FLUENZ with antiviral agents that are active against influenza A and/or B \nviruses has not been evaluated. However, based upon the potential for influenza antiviral agents to \nreduce the effectiveness of FLUENZ, it is recommended not to administer the vaccine until 48 hours \nafter the cessation of influenza antiviral therapy. Administration of influenza antiviral agents within \ntwo weeks of vaccination may affect the response of the vaccine. \n \nIf influenza antiviral agents and FLUENZ are administered concomitantly, revaccination should be \nconsidered when appropriate. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data from the use of FLUENZ in pregnant women. \n \nWhile animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive \ntoxicity, FLUENZ is not recommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreastfeeding \nIt is not known whether FLUENZ is excreted in human milk. Therefore, as some viruses are excreted \nin human milk, FLUENZ should not be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \nNo data exist regarding the possible effects of FLUENZ on male and female fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe vaccine is unlikely to have an effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nSafety data regarding use of FLUENZ have been compiled from over 28,500 children and \nadolescents 2 to 17 years of age from clinical studies and over 52,500 children and adolescents \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nfrom post-authorisation safety studies. Additional experience has occurred with marketed use \nof this vaccine. \n \nAlthough safety in children and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma has been established, data \nin children with other pulmonary diseases or with chronic cardiovascular, metabolic or renal diseases \nare limited. In studies of adults in which a high percentage of individuals had underlying chronic \nmedical conditions, the safety profile of FLUENZ was comparable to the safety profile observed in \nindividuals without these conditions. \n \nSummary of adverse reactions \n \nThe most common adverse reaction observed in clinical studies was nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea. \n \nAdverse reaction frequencies are reported as: \nVery common (≥ 1/10) \nCommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \nUncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) \nVery rare (< 1/10,000) \n \nImmune system disorders \nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reactions (including facial oedema, urticaria and very rare anaphylactic \nreactions) \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Decreased appetite \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \n \nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders \nVery common: Nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea \nUncommon: Epistaxis \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: Rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: Myalgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Malaise \nCommon: Pyrexia \n \nIn an active-controlled clinical study (MI-CP111), an increased rate of hospitalisations (for any cause) \nthrough 180 days after final vaccination dose was observed in infants and toddlers 6-11 months of \nage (6.1% FLUENZ versus 2.6% injectable influenza vaccine). The rate of hospitalisations was \nnot increased in FLUENZ recipients 12 months and older. In the same study, an increased rate of \nwheezing through 42 days was observed in infants and toddlers 6-23 months of age (5.9% FLUENZ \nversus 3.8% injectable influenza vaccine). The rate of wheezing was not increased in FLUENZ \nrecipients 24 months and older. FLUENZ is not indicated for use in infants and toddlers younger \nthan 24 months (see section 4.4). \n \nVery rare reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome and exacerbation of symptoms of Leigh syndrome \n(mitochondrial encephalomyopathy) have also been observed in the post-marketing setting. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere have been occasional reports of administration of twice the recommended dose of FLUENZ \nin the post-marketing setting. The adverse reactions reported were similar to those seen with the \nrecommended single dose of FLUENZ. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, influenza live attenuated; ATC Code: J07BB03 \n \nThe influenza virus strains in FLUENZ are (a) cold-adapted (ca); (b) temperature-sensitive (ts); and \n(c) attenuated (att). As a result, they replicate in the nasopharynx and induce protective immunity. \n \nEfficacy \nFLUENZ has been administered to over 30,000 individuals in controlled clinical studies over multiple \nyears, in various regions and using different vaccine strains. \n \nPaediatric studies \n \nFLUENZ’s efficacy data in the paediatric population consist of 9 controlled studies comprising \nover 20,000 infants and toddlers, children and adolescents, conducted during 7 influenza seasons. \nFour placebo-controlled studies included second season revaccination. FLUENZ has demonstrated \nsuperiority in 3 active-controlled studies with injectable influenza vaccine.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before the vaccine is given because it contains important \ninformation for you or your child. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes \n\nany possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Fluenz is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Fluenz \n3. How Fluenz is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fluenz \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fluenz is and what it is used for \n \nFluenz is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu). It is used in children and adolescents 24 months \nto less than 18 years of age. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) \nwill produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the \nvaccine can cause the flu. \n \nFluenz vaccine viruses are grown in chicken eggs. The vaccine targets three strains of influenza \nvirus each year, following the annual recommendations by the World Health Organisation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Fluenz \n \nYou will not be given Fluenz \n \n if you are allergic to eggs, egg proteins, gentamicin, or gelatin or any of the other ingredients \n\nof Fluenz (listed in section 6 “Contents of the pack and other information”). For signs of allergic \nreactions, see section 4 “Possible side effects”. \n\n if you have a blood disorder or a cancer that affects the immune system. \n if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result \n\nof a disease, medicine, or other treatment. \n if you are under 18 years of age and already taking acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present \n\nin many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever). This is because of the risk of a very \nrare but serious disease (Reye’s syndrome). \n\n \nIf any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination: \n if the child is less than 24 months of age. Children less than 24 months of age should not \n\nreceive this vaccine because of the risk of side effects. \n if you have severe asthma or are currently wheezing. \n if you are in close contact with someone with a severely weakened immune system \n\n(for example, a bone marrow transplant patient needing isolation). \n \nIf any of these apply, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before vaccination. He or she will \ndecide if Fluenz is suitable for you. \n \nOther medicines, other vaccines and Fluenz \n \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if the person being vaccinated is taking, has recently taken \nor might take any other medicines. \n Do not give acetylsalicylic acid to children aged less than 18 years for 4 weeks after \n\nvaccination with Fluenz unless your doctor, nurse or pharmacist tells you otherwise. \nThis is because of the risk of Reye’s syndrome, a very rare but serious disease that \ncan affect the brain and liver. \n\n It is recommended that Fluenz is not given at the same time as influenza-specific antiviral \nmedicines. This is because the vaccine may work less effectively. \n\n \nYour doctor, nurse or pharmacist will decide if Fluenz can be given at the same time as other vaccines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant soon or are breast \n\nfeeding, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before receiving this vaccine. Fluenz is not \nrecommended for women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding. \n\n \n \n3. How Fluenz is given \n \nFluenz will be administered under the supervision of a doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nFluenz must only be used as a nasal spray. \n \nFluenz must not be injected. \n \nFluenz will be given as a spray in each nostril.
