This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXenleta 600 mg film-coated tablets \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains lefamulin acetate equivalent to 600 mg of lefamulin. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nBlue, oval, film-coated tablet with \u2018LEF 600\u2019 printed in black on one side. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXenleta is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults when it is \nconsidered inappropriate to use antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial \ntreatment of CAP or when these have failed (see section 5.1). \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dosage of Xenleta is described in Table 1. \nPatients may be treated throughout with oral lefamulin according to their clinical condition. Patients \nwho commence treatment by the intravenous route (see the Summary of Product Characteristics for \nXenleta solution for infusion) may be switched to the oral tablets when clinically indicated. \n \nTable 1: Dosage of Xenleta \n\nDosage Treatment duration \nOral lefamulin only: \n \n600 mg Xenleta tablet orally every 12 hours \n\n5 days \n\nIntravenous lefamulin with option to switch to oral lefamulin: \n \n150 mg of Xenleta every 12 hours by intravenous infusion over 60 \nminutes with option to switch to 600 mg Xenleta tablet orally every 12 \nhours  \n\n7 days total treatment \nby the intravenous or \ncombined intravenous \nand oral routes  \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dosage adjustment is required for the elderly (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in renally impaired patients, including those receiving haemodialysis \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of lefamulin in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use. \nThe tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Xenleta should be taken on an empty stomach.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to any other members of the pleuromutilin class. \n \nCoadministration with moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g. efavirenz, phenytoin, rifampicin) \nor with strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.gclarithromycin, itraconazole, ritonavir) (see section 4.5). \n \nCoadministration with CYP3A substrates (e.g. antipsychotics, erythromycin, tricyclic antidepressants) \nthat prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5).  \n \nCoadministration with medicinal products that prolong the QT interval such as Class IA (e.g. \nquinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nKnown QT prolongation. \n \nElectrolyte disturbances, particularly uncorrected hypokalemia. \n \nClinically relevant bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, or history of symptomatic \nventricular arrhythmias. \n \nCoadministration with sensitive CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. repaglinide) (see section 4.5).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nProlongation of QTc interval and potential QTc-interval prolongation-related clinical conditions \n \nChanges in cardiac electrophysiology have been observed in non-clinical and clinical studies with \nlefamulin. In clinical trials in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the mean change in QTcF \nfrom baseline to Day 3 to 4 was 11.4 msec. Post-baseline QTcF increases >30 msec and >60msec \nwere seen in 17.9% and in 1.7% of patients, respectively, and were more frequent following \nintravenous lefamulin dosing compared to oral dosing. \n \nLefamulin should be used with caution in patients with renal failure who require dialysis because \nmetabolic disturbances associated with renal failure may lead to QT prolongation. \n \nLefamulin should be used with caution in patients with mild, moderate, or severe cirrhosis because \nmetabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nClostridioides (formerly known as Clostridium) difficile- associated diarrhoea \n \nC. difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been reported with lefamulin and may range in severity \nfrom mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with \ndiarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of lefamulin (see section 4.8). Careful medical \nhistory is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration \nof antibacterial medicinal products. \n \nIf CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial medicinal product use not directed against \nC. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate supportive measures together with the \nadministration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be considered. \n \nNon-susceptible microorganisms \n \nProlonged use may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms which may require \ninterruption of treatment or other appropriate measures. \n \nEffects on hepatic transaminases \n \nMonitoring of hepatic transaminases (ALT, AST) is recommended during treatment, especially in \npatients whose transaminases are elevated at baseline (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment  \n \nPatients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment have \nreduced lefamulin protein binding compared to healthy subjects or subjects with mild (Child-Pugh \nClass A) hepatic impairment. Treatment should be initiated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment only after a careful benefit/risk evaluation, due to possible adverse reactions related to \nhigher free concentrations of lefamulin, including prolongation of the QTcF interval. Patients should \nbe monitored closely during treatment. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nCo-administration of lefamulin with other medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).  \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nEffects of other products on lefamulin \n \nUse with moderate and strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers \nMedicinal products that are moderate or strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. rifampicin, St John\u00b4s wort \n[Hypericum perforatum], carbamazepine, phenytoin, bosentan, efavirenz, primidone) could \nsignificantly decrease lefamulin plasma concentration and may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of \nlefamulin. Co-administration of such medicinal products with lefamulin is contraindicated (see section \n4.3).  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nUse with strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors \nMedicinal products that are strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, diltiazem, \nitraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, ritonavir-containing regimens, voriconazole) \nmay alter absorption of lefamulin and therefore increase lefamulin plasma concentrations. Co-\nadministration of such medicinal products or grapefruit juice with lefamulin is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).  \n \nPotential for lefamulin to affect other medicinal products \n \nLefamulin is a moderate CYP3A inhibitor but has no induction potential.  \n \nCo-administration of oral lefamulin with agents metabolised by CYP3A such as alprazolam, alfentanil, \nibrutinib, lovastatin, simvastatin, , triazolam, vardenafil, and verapamil may result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of these medicinal products. See Table 2. \n \nCo-administration of lefamulin with agents metabolised by CYP2C8 (e.g. repaglinide) may result in \nincreased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Co-administration with sensitive \nsubstrates of CYP2C8 is contraindicated (see section 4.3 and Table 2). \n \nIn a clinical drug-drug interaction study, no clinically relevant interaction was observed when \nlefamulin was co-administered with the P-gp substrate digoxin. Clinical drug interaction studies with \nlefamulin and substrates of other transporters have not been performed. In vitro studies indicated that \nlefamulin acts as an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, OCT1 and MATE1 transporters. \nTherefore, caution is recommended when co-administering lefamulin with sensitive substrates of these \ntransporters, especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. \n \nTable 2 summarises effects on plasma concentrations of lefamulin and on co-administered medicinal \nproducts expressed as least-square mean ratios (90% confidence interval). The direction of the arrow \nindicates the direction of the change in exposures (Cmax and AUC), where \u2191 indicates an increase more \nthan 25%, \u2193 indicates a decrease more than 25%, and \u2194 indicates no change (equal to or less than \n25% decrease or increase).

Adverse reactions are classified according to \nSystem Organ Class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 3: Frequency of adverse reactions by system organ class from clinical trials \n\nSystem organ class Common Uncommon \nInfections and infestations \n\n \nClostridioides difficile colitis \nOropharyngeal candidiasis \nVulvovaginal mycotic infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n \nAnaemia \nThrombocytopenia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHypokalaemia \n \n\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia Anxiety \nNervous system disorders Headache Dizziness \n\nSomnolence \nCardiac disorders Electrocardiogram QT \n\nprolonged \nAtrial fibrillation \nPalpitations \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n \nOropharyngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea \nNausea \nVomiting \n\nAbdominal pain \nAbdominal pain upper \nConstipation \nDyspepsia \nEpigastric discomfort \nGastritis \nGastritis erosive \n\n\n\n9 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Alanine aminotransferase \nincreased* \nAspartate aminotransferase \nincreased*  \n\nAlkaline phosphatase increased \nGamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n \n\nUrinary retention \nInvestigations \n\n \nCreatinine phosphokinase \nincreased \n\n \n*In Phase 3 trials (pooled data for intravenous and oral formulations), post-baseline alanine \naminotransferase values >3x and >5x ULN occurred in 5% and 2% of Xenleta patients compared with \n5% and 1% of moxifloxacin patients. Post-baseline aspartate aminotransferase values >3x and >5x \nULN occurred in 4% and 1% of Xenleta patients compared with 2% and 1% of moxifloxacin patients. \nThose affected were asymptomatic with reversible clinical laboratory findings that typically peaked \nwithin the first week of Xenleta dosing. No Xenleta patient met Hy\u2019s Law criteria. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest single doses of lefamulin administered in clinical trials were 750 mg oral in healthy \nsubjects which were not associated with any serious adverse reactions. The QT interval may increase \nwith increasing exposure to lefamulin. Treatment of overdose with lefamulin should consist of \nobservation and general support measures. Haemodialysis will not significantly remove lefamulin \nfrom the systemic circulation. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, pleuromutilins, ATC code: J01XX12. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibacterial agent. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting \nwith the A- and P- sites of the peptidyl transferase centre (PTC) in the central part of domain V of the \n23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing correct positioning of the tRNA. \n \nResistance  \n \nResistance to lefamulin in normally susceptible species may be due to mechanisms that include \nspecific protection or modification of the ribosomal target by ABC-F proteins such as vga (A, B, E), \nCfr methyl transferase, or by mutations of ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 or in domain V of 23S rRNA. \n \nCfr generally confers cross-resistance with oxazolidinones, lincosamides, phenicols and group A \nstreptogramins. ABC-F proteins can confer cross-resistance with lincosamides and group A \nstreptogramins. \n \nOrganisms resistant to other pleuromutilin class antibacterial agents are generally cross-resistant to \nlefamulin. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nThe activity of lefamulin is not affected by mechanisms that confer resistance to beta-lactams, \nmacrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, folate-pathway inhibitors, mupirocin and glycopeptides. \n \nInherent resistance to lefamulin occurs in Enterobacterales (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae) and non-\nfermenting Gram-negative aerobes (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). \n \nAntibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrated no antagonism between lefamulin and amikacin, azithromycin, \naztreonam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, penicillin, tigecycline, \ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. \n \nSusceptibility testing interpretive criteria \n \nThe Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) recommended interpretive criteria are: \n \n\nOrganism Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (mg/L) \nSusceptible (\u2264S) Resistant (>R) \n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae 0.5 0.5 \nStaphylococcus aureus 0.25 0.25 \n\n \nPK/PD relationship \n \nThe antimicrobial activity of lefamulin against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus correlated best with the \nratio of the area under the concentration-time curve of free drug over 24 hours to the minimum \ninhibitory concentration (24-h AUC/MIC ratio).  \n \nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens \n \nEfficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against pathogens susceptible to lefamulin in vitro \nlisted under each indication:  \n \nCommunity-acquired Pneumonia \n \n\n\u2022 Gram-positive bacteria: \n- Streptococcus pneumoniae \n- Staphylococcus aureus \n\n\u2022 Gram-negative bacteria: \n- Haemophilus influenzae \n- Legionella pneumophila \n\n\u2022 Other bacteria: \n- Mycoplasma pneumoniae \n- Chlamydophila pneumoniae \n\n \nClinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens that are relevant to the \napproved indications although in vitro studies suggest that they would be susceptible to lefamulin in \nthe absence of acquired mechanisms of resistance: \n \n\n\u2022 Gram-negative bacteria: \n- Haemophilus parainfluenzae \n- Moraxella catarrhalis \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXenleta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in community-acquired pneumonia (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nInformation from clinical trials \n \nIn a post-hoc, subgroup analysis from two Phase 3 trials in patients with community-acquired \npneumonia, the clinical cure rates at a post-treatment visit in patients with any of a positive sputum \nculture, positive blood culture or positive urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae were lower for \npatients treated with lefamulin compared to patients treated with moxifloxacin. When treatment \ncommenced by the intravenous route the cure rates were 28/36 [77.8%; (95% confidence intervals \n(CIs) 60.8% to 89.9%)] for lefamulin vs. 26/31 [83.9%; (95% CI 66.3% to 94.6%)] for moxifloxacin. \nWhen treatment commenced by the oral route, the cure rates were 19/25 (76%; 95% CI 55.9% to \n90.6%) vs. 30/32 (93.8%; 95% CI 79.2% to 99.2%), respectively. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration of an immediate-release 600 mg tablet formulation, oral bioavailability of \nlefamulin under fasted conditions was 25.8%. Exposure on Day\u202f1 (AUC0-12h) was equivalent to the \nexposure obtained with lefamulin 150\u202fmg administered intravenously. \n \nThe concomitant administration of a high-fat, high calorie breakfast with a single oral dose of 600\u202fmg \nlefamulin (immediate release tablet) resulted in a slightly reduced absolute bioavailability (21.0%).  \n \nDistribution \n \nLefamulin is moderate to highly bound to plasma proteins (alpha-1 acid glycoprotein > human serum \nalbumin) within a range of 88-97% at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, 83-94% at 3 \u00b5g/mL, and 73-86% \nat 10 \u00b5g/mL (depending on assay), demonstrating saturable, non-linear binding between 1-10 \u00b5g/mL. \nThe steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately 2.5 L/kg. Rapid tissue distribution of \nlefamulin into skin and soft tissues was demonstrated using microdialysis, and into the epithelial lining \nfluid (ELF) using bronchoalveolar lavage.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn plasma, between 24 and 42% of lefamulin is metabolised primarily by CYP3A phase I reactions, \nleading mainly to hydroxylated metabolites devoid of antibacterial properties, most notably the main \nmetabolite BC-8041 (2R-hydroxy lefamulin). BC-8041 is the only metabolite in plasma accounting for \n>10% (13.6% to 17.3%) of total drug related material after oral dosing while no metabolites exceeded \n10% (\u22646.7%) after intravenous dosing. \n \nElimination \n \nElimination was multiphasic and the terminal t1/2 ranged between 9-10\u202fh after a single oral or \nintravenous administration. Overall, lefamulin was primarily eliminated via the non-renal route. \nBetween 9.6%-14.1% of an intravenous dose of lefamulin was excreted as unchanged drug in the \nurine. The total body clearance and the renal clearance following 150\u202fmg intravenous infusion were \napproximately 20\u202fL/h and 1.6\u202fL/h, respectively.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lefamulin were observed based on \ngender, race, or weight.  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nElderly \nIn CAP patients there was a trend of increasing lefamulin exposure with increasing age, with a~50% \nincrease in AUC0-24 at steady-state in patients aged \u226585 years compared to patients aged <65 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nA study was conducted to compare lefamulin pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration \nof 150 mg in 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and 7 matched healthy control subjects. Another \n8 subjects requiring haemodialysis received 150 mg lefamulin intravenously immediately before \ndialysis (on-dialysis) and on a non-dialysis day (off-dialysis). The AUC, Cmax, and CL of lefamulin \nand its main metabolite were comparable between subjects with severe renal impairment and matched \nhealthy subjects, and in subjects requiring haemodialysis whether on- or off-dialysis. Lefamulin and \nits main metabolite were not dialyzable. Renal impairment did not impact lefamulin elimination. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA study was conducted to compare lefamulin pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration \nof 150 mg in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), 8 subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), and 11 matched healthy control subjects. No \nclinically meaningful changes in the total AUC, Cmax, and CL of lefamulin and its main metabolite \nwere observed between subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and matched healthy \ncontrol subjects. Hepatic impairment did not meaningfully impact lefamulin elimination. Plasma \nprotein binding decreased with increased impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nIn rats, there were no effects on male or female fertility that were considered related to lefamulin. \nLefamulin/metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Maximal concentrations of \nradioactivity in plasma and milk were 3.29 and 10.7 \u00b5g equivalents/g, respectively, following a single \ndose of 30 mg/kg radio-labelled lefamulin. Lefamulin/metabolites crossed the placenta in pregnant \nrats. In the plasma of suckling rat pups, lefamulin exposure was demonstrated in only 1 of 3 litters of \ntreated dams in each of the mid and high dose groups on post-natal day 4. No test item was quantified \nin pup\u2019s plasma on post-natal day 20. \n \nAdverse reactions seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with \npossible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n \nIn the rat embryo-foetal development study of lefamulin during organogenesis (GD 6-17) there were \n1, 0, 2, and 1 malformed foetuses in control, low, mid, and high dose groups, respectively. Findings \nincluded malformations (cleft palate, short lower jaw, vertebral and rib malformations, and a cyst in \nthe neck region) at the mid and high doses, but the relationship to treatment is considered equivocal. \nDecreased or no ossification in a number of skeletal elements in all treated groups may indicate \ntreatment-related developmental delay at all doses evaluated. \n \nIn the rabbit embryo-foetal development study of lefamulin during organogenesis (GD 6-18), low \nnumbers of live foetuses in utero in treated groups limited the interpretation of the study. Additional \nfindings in the high dose group included decreased foetal weight and decreased or no ossification of \nskeletal elements, which may be indicative of developmental delay. \n \nIn a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats the pup live birth index was reduced (87.4%) in \nthe high dose group. In the absence of related findings at the same dose level in the rat embryo-foetal \ndevelopment study, stillbirth was considered to be a late stage pregnancy or delivery effect.  \n \nEvidence of dose-dependent regenerative anaemia in both species indicated lefamulin was potentially \nhaemolytic at concentrations that are higher than the concentration of the infusion solution which will \n\n\n\n13 \n\nbe used clinically. This effect was not apparent from an in vitro evaluation of blood compatibility \nusing human blood at a concentration of 0.6 mg/mL. \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate and solvent for solution for infusion. \nThe concentrate is a colourless solution. \nThe solvent is a colourless solution. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXenleta is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults when it is \nconsidered inappropriate to use antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial \ntreatment of CAP or when these have failed (see section 5.1). \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dosage of Xenleta is described in Table 1. \nPatients may be treated throughout with intravenous lefamulin according to their clinical condition. \nPatients who commence treatment by the intravenous route may be switched to the oral tablets (see the \nSummary of Product Characteristics for Xenleta 600 mg tablets) when clinically indicated. \n \nTable 1: Dosage of Xenleta \n\nDosage Treatment duration \nIntravenous lefamulin only: \n \n150 mg of Xenleta every 12 hours by intravenous infusion over 60 \nminutes \n\n7 days \n\nIntravenous lefamulin with option to switch to oral lefamulin: \n \n\n7 days total treatment \nby the intravenous or \ncombined intravenous \nand oral routes \n\n\n\n16 \n\nDosage Treatment duration \n150 mg of Xenleta every 12 hours by intravenous infusion over 60 \nminutes with option to switch to 600 mg Xenleta tablet orally every 12 \nhours \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dosage adjustment is required for the elderly (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in renally impaired patients, including those receiving haemodialysis \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of lefamulin in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntravenous use. \nXenleta is administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes in an infusion volume of 250 mL. \nThe recommended infusion rate should not be exceeded. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to any other members of the pleuromutilin class. \n \nCoadministration with moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g. efavirenz, phenytoin, rifampicin) \n(see section 4.5). \n \nCoadministration with CYP3A substrates (e.g. antipsychotics, erythromycin, tricyclic antidepressants) \nthat prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5). \n \nCoadministration with medicinal products that prolong the QT interval such as Class IA (e.g. \nquinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nKnown QT prolongation. \n \nElectrolyte disturbances, particularly uncorrected hypokalemia. \n \nClinically relevant bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, or history of symptomatic \nventricular arrhythmias. \n \nCoadministration with sensitive CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. repaglinide) (see section 4.5).  \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nProlongation of QTc interval and potential QTc-interval prolongation-related clinical conditions  \n \nChanges in cardiac electrophysiology have been observed in nonclinical and clinical studies with \nlefamulin. In clinical trials in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the mean change in QTcF \nfrom baseline to Day 3 to 4 was 11.4 msec. Post-baseline QTcF increases >30 msec and >60msec \nwere seen in 17.9% and in 1.7% of patients, respectively, and were more frequent following \nintravenous lefamulin dosing compared to oral dosing. \n \nThe magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of lefamulin or \nincreasing the rate of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore, the recommended dose and \ninfusion rate should not be exceeded. \n \nLefamulin should be used with caution in patients with renal failure who require dialysis because \nmetabolic disturbances associated with renal failure may lead to QT prolongation. \n \nLefamulin should be used with caution in patients with mild, moderate, or severe cirrhosis because \nmetabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. \n \nClostridioides (formerly known as Clostridium) difficile- associated diarrhoea \n \nC. difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been reported with lefamulin and may range in severity \nfrom mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with \ndiarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of lefamulin (see section 4.8). Careful medical \nhistory is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration \nof antibacterial medicinal products. \n \nIf CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial medicinal product use not directed against \nC. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate supportive measures together with the \nadministration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be considered. \n \nNon-susceptible microorganisms \n \nProlonged use may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms which may require \ninterruption of treatment or other appropriate measures. \n \nEffects on hepatic transaminases \n \nMonitoring of hepatic transaminases (ALT, AST) is recommended during treatment, especially in \npatients whose transaminases are elevated at baseline (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment  \n \nPatients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment have \nreduced lefamulin protein binding compared to healthy subjects or subjects with mild (Child-Pugh \nClass A) hepatic impairment. Treatment should be initiated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment only after a careful benefit/risk evaluation, due to possible adverse reactions related to \nhigher free concentrations of lefamulin, including prolongation of the QTcF interval. Patients should \nbe monitored closely during treatment.  \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 1,055 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 52.75% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nCo-administration with other medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval is contraindicated \n(see section 4.3). \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nEffects of other products on lefamulin \n \nUse with moderate and strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers \nMedicinal products that are moderate or strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. rifampicin, St John\u00b4s wort \n[Hypericum perforatum], carbamazepine, phenytoin, bosentan, efavirenz, primidone) could \nsignificantly decrease lefamulin plasma concentration and may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of \nlefamulin. Co-administration of such medicinal products with lefamulin is contraindicated (see section \n4.3). \n \nPotential for lefamulin to affect other medicinal products \n \nCo-administration of lefamulin with sensitive CYP2C8 substrates such as repaglinide may result in \nincreased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Co-administration with sensitive \nsubstrates of CYP2C8 is contraindicated (See section 4.3 and Table 2). \n \nIn a clinical drug-drug interaction study, no clinically relevant interaction was observed when \nlefamulin was co-administered with the P-gp substrate digoxin. Clinical drug interaction studies with \nlefamulin and substrates of other transporters have not been performed. In vitro studies indicated that \nlefamulin acts as an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, OCT2 and MATE1 transporters. \nTherefore, caution is recommended when co-administering lefamulin with sensitive substrates of these \ntransporters, especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. \n \nTable 2 summarises effects on plasma concentrations of lefamulin and on co-administered medicinal \nproducts expressed as least-square mean ratios (90% confidence interval). The direction of the arrow \nindicates the direction of the change in exposures (Cmax and AUC), where \u2191 indicates an increase more \nthan 25%, \u2193 indicates a decrease more than 25%, and \u2194 indicates no change (equal to or less than \n25% decrease or increase).The table below is not all inclusive. \n \nTable 2: Interactions and dose recommendations of intravenous Xenleta with other medicinal \nproducts \n\nMedicinal product \nby therapeutic \nareas/possible \nmechanism of \n\ninteraction \n\nEffect on \nmedicinal \n\nproduct levels \nCmax AUC Clinical comments \n\nANTIDEPRESSANTS \nFluvoxamine* \n100 mg twice daily \n \n(Mild inhibition of \nCYP3A) \n\nNot studied \nExpected \u2194 \nLefamulin \n\n  No dose adjustment of \nintravenous lefamulin \nrequired. \n\nANTIDIABETICS \nMetformin \n1000 mg singe dose \n \n(Inhibition of  \n\nNot studied \n \n\n  Caution is \nrecommended.

Gastrointestinal disorders were predominantly associated with the oral formulation of lefamulin \nand led to treatment discontinuation in <1%. \n \nThe most frequently reported serious adverse reaction is atrial fibrillation (<1%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nBased on pooled data from Phase 3 trials for both intravenous and oral formulations, the following \nadverse reactions have been identified with lefamulin. Adverse reactions are classified according to \nSystem Organ Class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 3: Frequency of adverse reactions by system organ class from clinical trials \n\nSystem organ class Common Uncommon \nInfections and infestations \n\n \nClostridioides difficile colitis \nOropharyngeal candidiasis \nVulvovaginal mycotic infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n \nAnaemia \nThrombocytopenia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHypokalaemia \n \n\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia Anxiety \nNervous system disorders Headache Dizziness \n\nSomnolence \nCardiac disorders Electrocardiogram QT \n\nprolonged \nAtrial fibrillation \nPalpitations \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n \nOropharyngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea \nNausea \nVomiting \n\nAbdominal pain \nAbdominal pain upper \nConstipation \nDyspepsia \nEpigastric discomfort \nGastritis \nGastritis erosive \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Alanine aminotransferase \nincreased* \nAspartate aminotransferase \nincreased* \n\nAlkaline phosphatase increased \nGamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased \n\n\n\n22 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n \n\nUrinary retention \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nInfusion site pain \nInfusion site phlebitis \nInfusion site erythema  \n\nInfusion site bruising \nInfusion site coldness \n\nInvestigations \n \n\nCreatinine phosphokinase \nincreased \n\n \n*In Phase 3 trials (pooled data for intravenous and oral formulations), post-baseline alanine \naminotransferase values >3x and >5x ULN occurred in 5% and 2% of Xenleta patients compared with \n5% and 1% of moxifloxacin patients. Post-baseline aspartate aminotransferase values >3x and >5x \nULN occurred in 4% and 1% of Xenleta patients compared with 2% and 1% of moxifloxacin patients. \nThose affected were asymptomatic with reversible clinical laboratory findings that typically peaked \nwithin the first week of Xenleta dosing. No Xenleta patient met Hy\u2019s Law criteria. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest single doses of lefamulin administered in clinical trials were 400 mg intravenous in \nhealthy subjects which were not associated with any serious adverse reactions. The QT interval may \nincrease with increasing exposure to lefamulin. Treatment of overdose with lefamulin should consist \nof observation and general support measures. Haemodialysis will not significantly remove lefamulin \nfrom the systemic circulation. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, pleuromutilins, ATC code: J01XX12. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibacterial agent. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting \nwith the A- and P- sites of the peptidyl transferase centre (PTC) in the central part of domain V of the \n23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing correct positioning of the tRNA.  \n \nResistance \n \nResistance to lefamulin in normally susceptible species may be due to mechanisms that include \nspecific protection or modification of the ribosomal target by ABC-F proteins such as vga (A, B, E), \nCfr methyl transferase, or by mutations of ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 or in domain V of 23S rRNA.  \n \nCfr generally confers cross-resistance with oxazolidinones, lincosamides, phenicols and group A \nstreptogramins. ABC-F proteins can confer cross-resistance with lincosamides and group A \nstreptogramins. \n \nOrganisms resistant to other pleuromutilin class antibacterial agents are generally cross-resistant to \nlefamulin. \n \nThe activity of lefamulin is not affected by mechanisms that confer resistance to beta-lactams, \nmacrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, folate-pathway inhibitors, mupirocin and glycopeptides. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23 \n\nInherent resistance to lefamulin occurs in Enterobacterales (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae) and non-\nfermenting Gram-negative aerobes (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). \n \nAntibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrated no antagonism between lefamulin and amikacin, azithromycin, \naztreonam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, linezolid, meropenem, penicillin, tigecycline, \ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin). \n \nSusceptibility testing interpretive criteria \n \nThe Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) recommended interpretive criteria are: \n \n\nOrganism Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (mg/L) \nSusceptible (\u2264S) Resistant (>R) \n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae 0.5 0.5 \nStaphylococcus aureus 0.25 0.25 \n\n \nPK/PD relationship \n \nThe antimicrobial activity of lefamulin against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus correlated best with the \nratio of the area under the concentration-time curve of free drug over 24 hours to the minimum \ninhibitory concentration (24-h AUC/MIC ratio).  \n \nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens \n \nEfficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against pathogens susceptible to lefamulin in vitro \nlisted under each indication: \n \nCommunity-acquired Pneumonia \n \n\n\u2022 Gram-positive bacteria: \n- Streptococcus pneumoniae \n- Staphylococcus aureus \n\n\u2022 Gram-negative bacteria: \n- Haemophilus influenzae \n- Legionella pneumophila \n\n\u2022 Other bacteria: \n- Mycoplasma pneumoniae \n- Chlamydophila pneumoniae \n\n \nClinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens that are relevant to the \napproved indications although in vitro studies suggest that they would be susceptible to lefamulin in \nthe absence of acquired mechanisms of resistance: \n \n\n\u2022 Gram-negative bacteria: \n- Haemophilus parainfluenzae \n- Moraxella catarrhalis \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXenleta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in community-acquired pneumonia (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nInformation from clinical trials \n \nIn a post-hoc, subgroup analysis from two Phase 3 trials in patients with community-acquired \npneumonia, the clinical cure rates at a post-treatment visit in patients with any of a positive sputum \nculture, positive blood culture or positive urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae were lower for \npatients treated with lefamulin compared to patients treated with moxifloxacin. When treatment \ncommenced by the intravenous route the cure rates were 28/36 [77.8%; (95% confidence intervals \n(CIs) 60.8% to 89.9%)] for lefamulin vs. 26/31 [83.9%; (95% CI 66.3% to 94.6%)] for moxifloxacin. \nWhen treatment commenced by the oral route, the cure rates were 19/25 (76%; 95% CI 55.9% to \n90.6%) vs. 30/32 (93.8%; 95% CI 79.2% to 99.2%), respectively. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nNot applicable. \n \nDistribution \n \nLefamulin is moderate to highly bound to plasma proteins (alpha-1 acid glycoprotein > human serum \nalbumin) within a range of 88-97% at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, 83-94% at 3 \u00b5g/mL, and 73-86% at \n10 \u00b5g/mL (depending on assay), demonstrating saturable, non-linear binding. The steady-state volume \nof distribution (Vss) is approximately 2.5 L/kg. Rapid tissue distribution of lefamulin into skin and soft \ntissues was demonstrated using microdialysis, and into the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) using \nbronchoalveolar lavage.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn plasma, between 24 and 42% of lefamulin is metabolised primarily by CYP3A phase I reactions, \nleading mainly to hydroxylated metabolites devoid of antibacterial properties, most notably the main \nmetabolite BC-8041 (2R-hydroxy lefamulin). BC-8041 is the only metabolite in plasma accounting for \n>10% (13.6% to 17.3%) of total drug related material after oral dosing while no metabolites exceeded \n10% (\u22646.7%) after intravenous dosing. \n \nElimination \n \nElimination was multiphasic and the terminal t1/2 ranged between 9-10\u202fh after a single oral or \nintravenous administration. Overall, lefamulin was primarily eliminated via the non-renal route. \nBetween 9.6%-14.1% of an intravenous dose of lefamulin was excreted as unchanged drug in the \nurine. The total body clearance and the renal clearance following 150\u202fmg intravenous infusion were \napproximately 20\u202fL/h and 1.6\u202fL/h, respectively. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lefamulin were observed based on \ngender, race or weight.  \n \nElderly \nIn CAP patients there was a trend of increasing lefamulin exposure with increasing age, with a~50% \nincrease in AUC0-24 at steady-state in patients aged \u226585 years compared to patients aged <65 years. \n \nRenal impairment \nA study was conducted to compare lefamulin pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration \nof 150 mg in 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and 7 matched healthy control subjects. Another \n8 subjects requiring haemodialysis received 150 mg lefamulin intravenously immediately before \ndialysis (on-dialysis) and on a non-dialysis day (off-dialysis). The AUC, Cmax, and CL of lefamulin \nand its main metabolite were comparable between subjects with severe renal impairment and matched \n\n\n\n25 \n\nhealthy subjects, and in subjects requiring haemodialysis whether on- or off-dialysis. Lefamulin and \nits main metabolite were not dialyzable. Renal impairment did not impact lefamulin elimination. \n \nHepatic impairment \nA study was conducted to compare lefamulin pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration \nof 150 mg in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), 8 subjects with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), and 11 matched healthy control subjects. No \nclinically meaningful changes in the total AUC, Cmax, and CL of lefamulin and its main metabolite \nwere observed between subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and matched healthy \ncontrol subjects. Hepatic impairment did not meaningfully impact lefamulin elimination. Plasma \nprotein binding decreased with increased impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nIn rats, there were no effects on male or female fertility that were considered related to lefamulin. \nLefamulin/metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Maximal concentrations of \nradioactivity in plasma and milk were 3.29 and 10.7 \u00b5g equivalents/g, respectively, following a single \ndose of 30 mg/kg radio-labelled lefamulin. Lefamulin/metabolites crossed the placenta in pregnant \nrats. In the plasma of suckling rat pups, lefamulin exposure was demonstrated in only 1 of 3 litters of \ntreated dams in each of the mid and high dose groups on post-natal day 4. No test item was quantified \nin pup\u2019s plasma on post-natal day 20. \n \nAdverse reactions seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with \npossible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n \nIn the rat embryo-foetal development study of lefamulin during organogenesis (GD 6-17), there were \n1, 0, 2, and 1 malformed foetuses in control, low, mid, and high dose groups. Findings included \nmalformations (cleft palate, short lower jaw, vertebral and rib malformations, and a cyst in the neck \nregion) at the mid and high doses, but the relationship to treatment is considered equivocal. Decreased \nor no ossification in a number of skeletal elements in all treated groups may indicate treatment-related \ndevelopmental delay at all doses evaluated.  \n \nIn the rabbit embryo-foetal development study of lefamulin during organogenesis (GD 6-18), low \nnumbers of live foetuses in utero in treated groups limited the interpretation of the study. Additional \nfindings in the high dose group included decreased foetal weight and decreased or no ossification of \nskeletal elements, which may be indicative of developmental delay. \n \nIn a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats the pup live birth index was reduced (87.4%) in \nthe high dose group. In the absence of related findings at the same dose level in the rat embryo-foetal \ndevelopment study, stillbirth was considered to be a late stage pregnancy or delivery effect.  \n \nEvidence of dose-dependent regenerative anaemia in both species indicated lefamulin was potentially \nhaemolytic at concentrations that are ten times higher than the concentration of the infusion solution \nwhich will be used clinically. This effect was not apparent from an in vitro evaluation of blood \ncompatibility using human blood at a concentration of 0.6 mg/mL. \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n46 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nXenleta 600 mg film-coated tablets \nlefamulin \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Xenleta is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Xenleta \n3. How to take Xenleta \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Xenleta \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n1. What Xenleta is and what it is used for \n \nXenleta is an antibiotic medicine containing the active substance lefamulin. It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called \u2018pleuromutilins\u2019. \n \nLefamulin works by killing certain bacteria which cause infections.  \n \nXenleta is used to treat adults who have bacterial infections in the lung, also known as pneumonia, \nwhen other treatments for pneumonia are not considered to be suitable. \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Xenleta  \n \nDo not take Xenleta \n\n- if you are allergic to lefamulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6)  \n\n- if you are allergic to other medicines from the pleuromutilin class \n- if you are taking certain medicines that might interact with Xenleta. This is because some \n\nmedicines may stop Xenleta working or lead to side effects if they are given with Xenleta. See \nbelow under Other medicines and Xenleta for examples.  \n\n- if you are taking medicines that can cause changes in the heart\u2019s electrical activity seen with an \nECG (see below under Other medicines and Xenleta). This is because lefamulin can cause a \ncondition called QT interval prolongation i.e. abnormal electrical activity that affects the heart\u2019s \nrhythm. \n\n- if you have a salt imbalance in the blood (especially low levels of potassium in the blood) \n- if you have or have had an irregular heart rhythm or an abnormal ECG finding called QT \n\nprolongation \n- if you have a very slow heart beat (bradycardia) \n- if your heart does not work well enough (heart failure) \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Xenleta \n\n- if you have kidney failure and require dialysis. \n- if you have cirrhosis (severe liver disease.)  \n\n \nIf any of these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor before taking Xenleta. \n \nIf you develop severe diarrhoea during or after taking Xenleta tablets, talk to your doctor because \nyou may need to stop your medicine, or you may need to take another medicine to treat the diarrhoea. \nAntibiotics can lead to excessive growth of certain bacteria in your bowel (gut) that can damage the \nbowel and cause severe diarrhoea. \n \nIf you develop yellow skin (jaundice) or the white of your eyes turn yellow (scleral icterus), talk \nto your doctor because you may need to stop taking Xenleta or other medicines. \n \nOther infections \nThere is a small possibility that you may get a different infection caused by another bacteria during or \nafter treatment with Xenleta. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any new infections and give \nyou another treatment if necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nXenleta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents less than 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Xenleta \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, as some of them could affect or be affected by Xenleta. The lists below provide only some \nexamples of medicines that should be avoided while taking lefamulin or for which caution is needed. \nYour doctor will a dvise you if lefamulin is suitable for you. \n \nYou must not take any of the following medicines with lefamulin:  \n\n- carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone (for epilepsy)  \n- efavirenz, ritonavir- (for HIV) \n- St. John\u2019s Wort, an herbal remedy (for depression or low mood)  \n- bosentan diltiazem, amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, procainamide (for angina, high blood \n\npressure or heart rhythm disturbances) \n- rifampicin, clarithromycin, erythromycin (for bacterial infections) \n- fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (for fungal infections) \n- ketoconazole (for Cushing\u2019s disease) \n- repaglinide (for diabetes) \n- nefazodone, amitryptylline or pimozide (for depression or other mental illness) \n\n \nYour doctor may need to adjust the dose of some medicines while you are taking lefamulin. These \nmedicines include: \n\n* alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam or other drugs called benzodiazepines (for anxiety)  \n* alfentanil (an opioid for pain)  \n* vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction) \n* ibrutinib (for certain types of cancer) \n* lovastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin (to reduce cholesterol levels) \n* metformin (for diabetes) \n* zolpidem (for insomnia) \n* ethinyl oestradiol (used in birth control pills) \n* verapamil (for high blood pressure) \n\n \nXenleta with food and drink  \nXenleta should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. This is \nbecause food and some drinks can affect the way medicines work. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \nYou must not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while on treatment with Xenleta as it might \ninteract with Xenleta and increase side effects.  \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding \nDo not take Xenleta if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think \nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before \ntaking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTaking Xenleta will not influence the ability to drive or use machines. \n \nXenleta contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially, \u2018sodium \nfree\u2019. \n \n3. How to take Xenleta \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one 600-mg Xenleta tablet taken every 12 hours for 5 days. The tablets \nshould be swallowed whole with water. \n \nXenleta tablets may also be taken after starting treatment with Xenleta infusion via an intravenous \ndrip. The number of days you then need to take Xenleta tablets will depend on how many days you \nhad treatment by a drip.  \n \nYour doctor will tell you for how long you should take Xenleta. It is important that you complete the \ncourse. \n \nIf you take more Xenleta than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nIf you forget to take Xenleta \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. You should continue with your course \nfrom the next scheduled dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Xenleta \nTake the complete course of tablets prescribed by your doctor, even if you begin to feel better before \nyou have finished them all. If you stop taking the tablets too soon, the infection may return, or your \ncondition may get worse. \n \nSome bacteria may remain and become resistant to antibiotics if you do not complete the course or if \nyou do not take your tablets at the right time. This can result in the infection returning or in the \nantibiotic not working if the infection returns. \n \nIf you get a side effect that concerns you, tell a doctor immediately to get advice before taking the next \ndose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n* low potassium levels in your blood (hypokalaemia), which can cause muscle weakness, \n\ntwitching or abnormal heart rhythm  \n* difficulty sleeping (insomnia) \n* headache \n* change of the heart rhythm (seen on an ECG, which monitors the electrical activity of the heart) \n* diarrhoea \n* feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) \n* increase of a special liver enzyme in the blood (transaminases)  \n \n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n* inflammation of the bowel causing diarrhoea (colitis), due to an infection by a type of bacteria \n\ncalled Clostridioides difficile (previously called Clostridium difficile) \n* fungal (yeast) infection of the throat and mouth (thrush or candida infection) \n* fungal (yeast) infection of the vagina and vulva (thrush or candida infection) \n* reduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which can make the skin pale and cause weakness or \n\nbreathlessness  \n* reduction in blood platelets (blood cells which help the blood to clot), which increases your risk \n\nof bleeding or bruising  \n* feeling anxious \n* dizziness \n* feeling tired or drowsy \n* irregular heartbeat or rhythm or palpitations \n* pain at the back of the nose and throat \n* stomach pain, pain in the abdomen or around the stomach \n* constipation \n* indigestion, stomach acidity (heartburn), or inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis) \n* increase of a liver enzyme in the blood (gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase) \n* increase in a muscle enzyme in the blood (creatine phosphokinase) \n* difficulty in urinating or in fully emptying your bladder (urinary retention) \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What Xenleta is and what it is used for \n \nXenleta is an antibiotic medicine that contains the active substance lefamulin. It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called \u2018pleuromutilins\u2019. \n \nLefamulin works by killing certain bacteria which cause infections.  \n \nXenleta is used to treat adults who have bacterial infections in the lung, also known as pneumonia, \nwhen other treatments for pneumonia are not considered to be suitable. \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Xenleta \n \nYou must not be given Xenleta \n\n- if you are allergic to lefamulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6) \n\n- if you are allergic to other medicines from the pleuromutilin class \n- if you are taking certain medicines that might interact with Xenleta. This is because some \n\nmedicines may stop Xenleta working or lead to side effects if they are given with Xenleta. See \nbelow under Other medicines and Xenleta for examples.  \n\n- if you are taking medicines that can cause changes in the heart\u2019s electrical activity seen with an \nECG (see below under Other medicines and Xenleta). This is because lefamulin can cause a \ncondition called QT interval prolongation i.e. abnormal electrical activity that affects the heart\u2019s \nrhythm. \n\n- if you have a salt imbalance in the blood (especially low levels of potassium in the blood) \n- if you have or have had an irregular heart rhythm or an abnormal ECG finding called QT \n\nprolongation \n- if you have a very slow heart beat (bradycardia) \n- if your heart does not work well enough (heart failure) \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Xenleta \n\n- if you have kidney failure and require dialysis. \n- if you have cirrhosis (severe liver disease) \n\n \nIf any of these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor before you are given Xenleta. \n \nIf you develop severe diarrhoea during or after being given Xenleta, tell your doctor immediately \nsince it may be necessary to interrupt your treatment. Antibiotics can lead to excessive growth of \ncertain bacteria in your bowel (gut) that can damage the bowel and cause severe diarrhoea.  \n \nIf you develop yellow skin (jaundice) or the white of your eyes turn yellow (scleral icterus), talk \nto your doctor because you may need to stop taking Xenleta or other medicines. \n \nOther infections \nThere is a small possibility that you may get a different infection caused by another bacteria during or \nafter treatment with Xenleta. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any new infections and give \nyou another treatment if necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nXenleta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Xenleta \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, as some of \nthese could affect or be affected by Xenleta. The lists below provide only some examples of medicines \nthat should be avoided while taking lefamulin or for which caution is needed. Your doctor will a dvise \nyou if lefamulin is suitable for you. \n \nYou must not take any of the following medicines with lefamulin:  \n\n- carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone (for epilepsy) \n- efavirenz (for HIV) \n- St. John\u2019s Wort, an herbal remedy (for depression or low mood) \n- bosentan, diltiazem, amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, procainamide (for angina, high blood \n\npressure or heart rhythm disturbances) \n- rifampicin, clarithromycin, erythromycin (for bacterial infections) \n- fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (for fungal infections)  \n- ketoconazole (for Cushing\u2019s disease)  \n- repaglinide (for diabetes) \n- nefazodone, amitryptylline or pimozide (for depression or other mental illness) \n\n \nYour doctor may need to adjust the dose of some medicines while you are taking lefamulin. These \nmedicines include: \n\n* lovastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin (to reduce cholesterol levels)  \n* metformin (for diabetes) \n* ethinyl oestradiol (used in birth control pills) \n\n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding \nYou should not be given Xenleta if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or \nbreastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or nurse for \nadvice before you are given this medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nTaking Xenleta will not influence the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nXenleta contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains 1,055 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dosage unit. \nThis is equivalent to 53% of the recommeded maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n3. How you will be given Xenleta \n \nXenleta will be given to you by a doctor or nurse.  \n \nThe recommended dose for adults is 150 mg every 12 hours. It will be given to you through a drip \ndirectly into a vein (intravenously) over a period of 1 hour.  \n \nA course of treatment usually lasts for 7 days, or longer if your doctor recommends it. \n \nYour doctor may decide to switch you from having Xenleta through a drip to taking Xenleta tablets to \ncomplete your treatment for a total (drip and tablet) of 7 days of treatment. \n \nIf you are given more Xenleta than you should receive \nXenleta will be given to you in hospital by a doctor or nurse. It is, therefore, unlikely you will be given \ntoo much. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are concerned that you may have been given too much \nXenleta. \n \nIf you miss a dose of Xenleta \nXenleta will be given to you in hospital by a doctor or nurse. It is therefore unlikely you will miss a \ndose. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are concerned that you have missed a dose.  \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\n* low potassium levels in your blood (hypokalemia), which can cause muscle weakness, twitching \nor abnormal heart rhythm \n\n* difficulty sleeping (insomnia) \n* headache \n* diarrhoea \n* feeling sick (nausea), or being sick (vomiting) \n* increase of a special liver enzyme in the blood (transaminases) \n* redness or swelling or pain at the site of the injection  \n* alteration of the heart rhythm (seen on an ECG, which monitors the electrical activity of the \n\nheart) \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\n* inflammation of the bowel causing diarrhoea (colitis), due to an infection by a type of bacteria \ncalled Clostridioides difficile (previously called Clostridium difficile)  \n\n* fungal (yeast) infection of the throat and mouth (thrush or candida infection) \n* fungal (yeast) infection of the vagina and vulva (thrush or candida infection) \n* reduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which can make the skin pale and cause, weakness or \n\nbreathlessness \n* reduction in blood platelets (blood cells which help the blood to clot), which increases risk of \n\nbleeding or bruising  \n* feeling anxious \n* dizziness \n* feeling tired or drowsy \n* irregular heart beat or rhythm or palpitations \n* pain at the back of the nose and throat \n* stomach pain, pain in the abdomen or around the stomach  \n* constipation \n\n\n\n54 \n\n* indigestion, stomach acidity (heartburn), or inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis) \n* increase of a liver enzyme in the blood (gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase) \n* increase in a muscle enzyme in the blood (creatine phosphokinase) \n* difficulty urinating or in fully emptying your bladder (urinary retention) \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V.

you need to know before you take xenleta", "Section_Content": "do not take xenleta - if you are allergic to lefamulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) - if you are allergic to other medicines from the pleuromutilin class - if you are taking certain medicines that might interact with xenleta. this is because some medicines may stop xenleta working or lead to side effects if they are given with xenleta. see below under other medicines and xenleta for examples. - if you are taking medicines that can cause changes in the heart's electrical activity seen with an ecg (see below under other medicines and xenleta). this is because lefamulin can cause a condition called qt interval prolongation i.e. abnormal electrical activity that affects the heart's rhythm. - if you have a salt imbalance in the blood (especially low levels of potassium in the blood) - if you have or have had an irregular heart rhythm or an abnormal ecg finding called qt prolongation - if you have a very slow heart beat (bradycardia) - if your heart does not work well enough (heart failure) 47 warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given xenleta - if you have kidney failure and require dialysis. - if you have cirrhosis (severe liver disease.) if any of these apply to you, or if you are not sure, tell your doctor before taking xenleta. if you develop severe diarrhoea during or after taking xenleta tablets, talk to your doctor because you may need to stop your medicine, or you may need to take another medicine to treat the diarrhoea. antibiotics can lead to excessive growth of certain bacteria in your bowel (gut) that can damage the bowel and cause severe diarrhoea. if you develop yellow skin (jaundice) or the white of your eyes turn yellow (scleral icterus), talk to your doctor because you may need to stop taking xenleta or other medicines. other infections there is a small possibility that you may get a different infection caused by another bacteria during or after treatment with xenleta. your doctor will monitor you closely for any new infections and give you another treatment if necessary. children and adolescents xenleta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents less than 18 years old. other medicines and xenleta tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, as some of them could affect or be affected by xenleta. the lists below provide only some examples of medicines that should be avoided while taking lefamulin or for which caution is needed. your doctor will a dvise you if lefamulin is suitable for you. you must not take any of the following medicines with lefamulin: - carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone (for epilepsy) - efavirenz, ritonavir- (for hiv) - st. john's wort, an herbal remedy (for depression or low mood) - bosentan diltiazem, amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, procainamide (for angina, high blood pressure or heart rhythm disturbances) - rifampicin, clarithromycin, erythromycin (for bacterial infections) - fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (for fungal infections) - ketoconazole (for cushing's disease) - repaglinide (for diabetes) - nefazodone, amitryptylline or pimozide (for depression or other mental illness) your doctor may need to adjust the dose of some medicines while you are taking lefamulin. these medicines include: * alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam or other drugs called benzodiazepines (for anxiety) * alfentanil (an opioid for pain) * vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction) * ibrutinib (for certain types of cancer) * lovastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin (to reduce cholesterol levels) * metformin (for diabetes) * zolpidem (for insomnia) * ethinyl oestradiol (used in birth control pills) * verapamil (for high blood pressure) xenleta with food and drink xenleta should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. this is because food and some drinks can affect the way medicines work. you must not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while on treatment with xenleta as it might interact with xenleta and increase side effects. pregnancy, breast-feeding do not take xenleta if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. driving and using machines taking xenleta will not influence the ability to drive or use machines. xenleta contains sodium

the tablets should be swallowed whole with water. xenleta tablets may also be taken after starting treatment with xenleta infusion via an intravenous drip. the number of days you then need to take xenleta tablets will depend on how many days you had treatment by a drip. your doctor will tell you for how long you should take xenleta. it is important that you complete the course. if you take more xenleta than you should if you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist. if you forget to take xenleta do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. you should continue with your course from the next scheduled dose. if you stop taking xenleta take the complete course of tablets prescribed by your doctor, even if you begin to feel better before you have finished them all. if you stop taking the tablets too soon, the infection may return, or your condition may get worse. some bacteria may remain and become resistant to antibiotics if you do not complete the course or if you do not take your tablets at the right time. this can result in the infection returning or in the antibiotic not working if the infection returns. if you get a side effect that concerns you, tell a doctor immediately to get advice before taking the next dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.",

infection of the throat and mouth (thrush or candida infection) * fungal (yeast) infection of the vagina and vulva (thrush or candida infection) * reduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which can make the skin pale and cause weakness or breathlessness * reduction in blood platelets (blood cells which help the blood to clot), which increases your risk of bleeding or bruising * feeling anxious * dizziness * feeling tired or drowsy * irregular heartbeat or rhythm or palpitations * pain at the back of the nose and throat * stomach pain, pain in the abdomen or around the stomach * constipation *
