This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nKyntheum 210 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 210 mg brodalumab in 1.5 ml solution. \n1 ml solution contains 140 mg brodalumab. \n \nBrodalumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary \n(CHO) cells. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nThe solution is clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow and free from particles. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKyntheum is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who \nare candidates for systemic therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKyntheum is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of psoriasis. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 210 mg administered by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 1, and 2 \nfollowed by 210 mg every 2 weeks. \n \nConsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response \nafter 12-16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve \nwith continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (aged 65 years and over) \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nKyntheum has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made.  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Kyntheum in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not \nyet been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nKyntheum is administered by subcutaneous injection. Each pre-filled syringe is for single use only. \nKyntheum should not be injected into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, or \naffected by psoriasis. The pre-filled syringe must not be shaken. \n \nAfter proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Kyntheum when \ndeemed appropriate by a physician. Patients should be instructed to inject the full amount of \nKyntheum according to the instructions provided in the package leaflet. Comprehensive instructions \nfor administration are given in the package leaflet.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive Crohn\u2019s disease. \n \nClinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)  \nCases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with IL-17 \ninhibitors. Therefore Kyntheum is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (see \nsection 4.8). If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, or experiences \nan exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, Kyntheum should be discontinued and \nappropriate medical management should be initiated. \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour, including completed suicide, have been reported in patients treated \nwith Kyntheum. The majority of patients with suicidal behaviour had a history of depression and/or \nsuicidal ideation or behaviour. A causal association between treatment with Kyntheum and increased \nrisk of suicidal ideation and behaviour has not been established.  \n \nThe risk and benefit of treatment with Kyntheum should be carefully weighed for patients with a \nhistory of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour, or for patients who develop such \nsymptoms. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the \nemergence or worsening of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, or other mood changes, and they \nshould contact their healthcare provider if such events occur. If a patient suffers from new or \nworsening symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour is identified, it is \nrecommended to discontinue treatment with Kyntheum. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \nRare cases of anaphylactic reactions have been reported in the post-marketing setting. In the event of \nan anaphylactic reaction, or any other serious allergic reaction, administration of Kyntheum should be \ndiscontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nInfections \nKyntheum may increase the risk of infections.  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \nDuring the 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trial period in patients with psoriasis, serious infections \nwere observed in 0.5% of patients receiving Kyntheum (see section 4.8).  \n \nCaution should be exercised when considering the use of Kyntheum in patients with a chronic \ninfection or a history of recurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if \nsigns or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the \npatient should be closely monitored and Kyntheum should not be administered until the infection \nresolves. \n \nNo cases of active tuberculosis were reported from clinical trials. However, Kyntheum should not be \ngiven to patients with active tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should be considered prior to \ninitiation of Kyntheum in patients with latent tuberculosis.  \n \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that patients be brought up-to-date with all immunisations in accordance with local \nimmunisation guidelines prior to initiation of treatment with Kyntheum. Live vaccines should not be \ngiven concurrently with Kyntheum (see section 4.5). No data are available on the response to live \nvaccines or the risk of infection, or transmission of infection after the administration of live vaccines in \npatients receiving Kyntheum. \n \nVaccination of infants \nVaccination of infants with live vaccines following third trimester exposure to Kyntheum should be \ndiscussed with a physician (see also section 4.6). \n \nConcomitant immunosuppressive therapy \nThe safety and efficacy of Kyntheum in combination with immunosuppressants, including biologics, \nor phototherapy have not been evaluated. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with Kyntheum (see section 4.4). \n \nThe formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g. IL-1, \nIL-6, IL-10, TNF\u03b1, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Although a role for interleukin (IL)-17A and \nIL-17RA in the regulation of CYP450 enzymes has not been reported, the effect of brodalumab on \nCYP3A4/3A5 activity was evaluated in a disease-drug-drug interaction study.  \n \nIn patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, a single subcutaneous dose of 210 mg \nbrodalumab increased the exposure of midazolam, a CYP3A4/3A5 substrate by 24%. Based on the \nmagnitude of change in exposure of midazolam, no dose adjustment of CYP3A4/3A5 substrates is \nnecessary when administered concomitantly with Kyntheum. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \nWomen of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and \nfor at least 12 weeks after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of brodalumab in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nHuman IgG2 is known to cross the placental barrier and brodalumab is a human IgG2, therefore, \nbrodalumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. As a \nprecautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Kyntheum in pregnancy.  \n \nAs the metabolism of brodalumab is unknown in infants, benefit risk for exposure of the infant to live \nvaccines following third trimester exposure to Kyntheum should be discussed with a physician. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether brodalumab is excreted in human milk. Brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody \nand is expected to be present in the first milk and at low levels afterwards. \n  \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nKyntheum therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nNo data are available on the effect of brodalumab on human fertility. Animal studies did not show any \neffects on male and female reproductive organs and on sperm count, motility and morphology (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKyntheum has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in all Kyntheum-treated patients were arthralgia \n(4.6%), headache (4.3%), fatigue (2.6%), diarrhoea (2.2%), and oropharyngeal pain (2.1%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA \nsystem organ class (SOC). Within each SOC, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the \nmost frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping adverse reactions are presented in order \nof decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction \nis based on the following convention: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nTable 1: List of adverse reactions in clinical trials and post-marketing experience \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reaction \nInfections and infestations Common Influenza \n\nTinea infections (including tinea pedis, tinea \nversicolor, tinea cruris) \n\n Uncommon Candida infections (including oral, genital, and \noesophageal infections) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Neutropenia \n\nImmune system disorders Rare Anaphylactic reaction* \nNervous system disorders Common Headache \nEye disorders Uncommon Conjunctivitis \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Oropharyngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Diarrhoea \nNausea \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Arthralgia \nMyalgia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Fatigue \nInjection site reactions (including injection site \nerythema, pain, pruritus, bruising, \nhaemorrhage) \n\n*from post-marketing experience \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInflammatory bowel disease \nCases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and \nulcerative colitis) have been reported with IL-17 inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nInfections \nDuring the 12-week placebo-controlled trial period in plaque psoriasis, infections were reported in \n28.2% of patients treated with Kyntheum compared with 23.4% of patients treated with placebo. The \nmajority of infections consisted of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, \nurinary tract infections, bronchitis, influenza and sinusitis, which did not necessitate treatment \ndiscontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with Kyntheum and in 0.1% of \npatients treated with placebo. Higher rates of fungal infections, primarily non-serious skin and mucosal \ncandida infections, were observed in Kyntheum patients compared to placebo patients, 2.5% vs 1.0%, \nrespectively.  \n \nThrough Week 52, the event rates per 100 patient-years for infections were 134.7 for patients treated \nwith Kyntheum and 124.1 for patients treated with ustekinumab. The event rates per 100 patient-years \nfor serious infections were 2.4 for patients treated with Kyntheum and 1.2 for patients treated with \nustekinumab. One serious case of cryptococcal meningitis and one serious case of coccidioidies \ninfection were observed in clinical trials (see section 4.4). \n \nNeutropenia \nDuring the 12-week placebo-controlled period of clinical trials, neutropenia was reported in 0.9% of \npatients treated with Kyntheum compared with 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Most of the \nKyntheum-associated neutropenias were mild, transient and reversible. \n \nNeutropenia Grade 3 (<1.0 \u00d7 10\u02c69/L to 0.5 \u00d7 10\u02c69/L) was reported in 0.5% of patients receiving \nKyntheum compared to none of the patients who received ustekinumab or placebo. No Neutropenia \nGrade 4 (<0.5 \u00d7 10\u02c69/L) was reported in patients who received either Kyntheum or placebo, but in \n0.2% of patients who received ustekinumab. No serious infections were associated with neutropenia. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nImmunogenicity \nAntibodies to brodalumab developed in 2.2% (88/3935) of patients treated with Kyntheum for up to 52 \nweeks in psoriasis clinical trials (0.3% of the patients had anti-brodalumab antibodies at baseline). Of \nthese patients, none had neutralising antibodies. \n \nNo evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, clinical response, or safety profile was associated with \nanti-brodalumab antibody development. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 700 mg intravenously have been administered in clinical trials with no evidence of dose \nlimiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any \nsigns or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted \nimmediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC12 \n \nMechanism of action \nBrodalumab is a recombinant fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin IgG2 antibody that binds with \nhigh affinity to human IL-17RA and blocks the biological activities of the pro-inflammatory cytokines \nIL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17A/F heterodimer, IL-17C and IL-17E (also known as IL-25), resulting in \ninhibition of the inflammation and clinical symptoms associated with psoriasis. IL-17RA is a protein \nexpressed on the cell surface and is a required component of receptor complexes utilized by multiple \nIL-17 family cytokines. IL-17 family cytokine levels have been reported to be increased in psoriasis. \nIL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17A/F heterodimer have pleiotropic activities including the induction of pro-\ninflammatory mediators such as IL-6, GRO\u03b1, and G-CSF from epithelial cells, endothelial cells and \nfibroblasts that promote tissue inflammation. IL-17C has been shown to induce similar responses as \nIL-17A and IL-17F in keratinocytes. Blocking IL-17RA inhibits IL-17 cytokine-induced responses \nresulting in normalization of inflammation in the skin. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \nElevated levels of IL-17A, IL-17C and IL-17F gene expression are found in psoriatic plaques. \nElevated levels of expression of IL-12B and IL-23A, the genes for the two subunits of IL-23, an \nupstream activator of IL-17A and IL-17F expression, are also found in psoriatic plaques. Treatment \nwith Kyntheum in psoriasis patients has been shown to decrease levels of IL-17A and markers of cell \nproliferation and epidermal thickness in lesional skin biopsies to non-lesional skin biopsy levels up to \n12 weeks post-treatment. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \nThe efficacy and safety of Kyntheum was assessed in 4373 adult plaque psoriasis patients across three \nmultinational, randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled clinical trials (AMAGINE-1, \nAMAGINE-2, and AMAGINE-3). AMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3 were also active comparator \n(ustekinumab)-controlled. All three trials included a 12-week placebo-controlled induction phase, a \ndouble-blind duration of 52 weeks, and an open-label long-term extension. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nPatients enrolled were candidates for systemic therapy, including phototherapy, biologic and non-\nbiologic systemic therapies. Approximately 21% of patients had a history of psoriatic arthritis. \nApproximately 30% of patients had previously received a biological and 13% of patients were \nbiological failures. \n \nPatients were predominantly men (70%) and white (91%), with a mean age of 45 years (18 to 86 \nyears), of these 6.4% were \u226565 years of age and 0.3% were >75 years of age. Across treatment \ngroups, the baseline Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ranged from 9.4 to 72 (median: 17.4) \nand baseline involved body surface area (BSA) ranged from 10 to 97 (median: 21). Baseline static \nPhysician Global Assessment (sPGA) score ranged from \u201c3 (moderate)\u201d (58%) to \u201c5 (very severe)\u201d \n(5%). \n \nAMAGINE-1 was conducted in 661 patients. The trial included a 12-week double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled induction phase followed by a double-blind withdrawal and retreatment phase up to 52 \nweeks. Patients randomised to Kyntheum received 210 mg or 140 mg at Week 0 (day 1), Week 1, and \nWeek 2 followed by same dose every 2 weeks. At Week 12, patients originally randomised to \nKyntheum who achieved sPGA success (0 or 1) were re-randomised to receive either placebo or \ncontinued Kyntheum at their induction dose. Patients originally randomised to placebo and those who \ndid not meet the criteria for re-randomisation received Kyntheum 210 mg every two weeks beginning \nat Week 12. Retreatment was available at or after Week 16 for patients with return of disease and \nrescue treatment was available after 12 weeks of retreatment.  \n \nAMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3 were identical placebo- and ustekinumab-controlled trials conducted \nin 1831 and 1881 patients, respectively. Both trials included a 12-week double-blind, placebo- and \nustekinumab-controlled induction phase followed by a double-blind maintenance phase up to 52 \nweeks. Patients randomised to Kyntheum in the induction phase received 210 mg or 140 mg at Week 0 \n(day 1), Week 1, and Week 2 followed by same dose every 2 weeks. Patients randomised to \nustekinumab received 45 mg for patients \u2264100 kg and 90 mg for patients >100 kg at Weeks 0, 4, and \n16 followed by same dose every 12 weeks. At Week 12, patients originally randomised to Kyntheum \nwere re-randomised to receive either 210 mg every 2 weeks, or 140 mg every 2 weeks, or 140 mg \nevery 4 weeks, or 140 mg every 8 weeks during the maintenance phase. Patients originally randomised \nto placebo received Kyntheum 210 mg every 2 weeks beginning at Week 12. At Week 12, patients in \nthe ustekinumab group continued to receive ustekinumab and then were switched to Kyntheum \n210 mg every 2 weeks at Week 52. Rescue treatment was available at or after Week 16 for patients \nwith an inadequate response single sPGA \u22653 or persistent sPGA of 2 over at least a 4-week period.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nTable 2: Overview of the main efficacy results \n \n\n AMAGINE-1 AMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3 \n Placebo \n\n \nKyntheum \n\n210 mg Q2W \nPlacebo \n\n \nKyntheum \n\n210 mg Q2W \nUstekinumab \n\n \nn-randomised 220 222 624 1236 613 \nn-completed Week 12 209 212 601 1205 594 \nn-in maintenance 84 83 NA 339 590 \nn-completed Week 52  2 74 NA 236 300 \n      \nPASI       \nPASI Baseline score (mean\u00b1SD) 19.7\u00b17.7 19.4\u00b16.6 20.2\u00b18.4 20.3\u00b18.3 20.0\u00b18.4 \nPASI 75 Week 12 (%) 3 83* 7 86* 70* \nPASI 75 Week 52 (%) 0 87* NA 65 48 \n      \nsPGA (%)      \nsPGA 0 or 1 Week 12  1 76* 4 79* 59* \nsPGA 0 or 1 Week 52  0 83* NA 65 45 \n      \nPSI      \nPSIBaseline score (mean\u00b1SD) 19.0\u00b16.7 18.9\u00b16.7 18.8\u00b16.9 18.7\u00b17.0 18.8\u00b16.9 \nPSIresponder Week 12  (%) 4 61* 7 64* 54* \nQ2W = every 2 weeks \nPSI = Psoriasis Symptom Inventory.

In moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients following a single subcutaneous \nadministration of Kyntheum at 210 mg, the mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) was \n13.4 mcg/ml (standard deviation [SD] = 7.29 mcg/ml). The median time to maximum concentration \n(Tmax) was 3.0 days (range: 2.0 to 4.0 days) and the mean area under the concentration time curve to \nthe last measurable concentration (AUClast) was 111 mcg*day/ml (SD = 64.4 mcg*day/ml). The \nsubcutaneous bioavailability of brodalumab estimated by population pharmacokinetic modelling was \n55%. \n \nThe observed pharmacokinetic parameters during steady-state (weeks 10-12) were:  mean steady-state \narea under the concentration time curve over the dosing interval (AUCtau) was 227.4 mcg*day/ml (SD \n= 191.7 mcg*day/ml) corresponding to average concentration (Cav,ss) of 16.2 mcg/ml, mean Cmax was \n20.9 mcg/ml (SD = 17.0 mcg/ml) and Week 12 mean minimum serum concentration (Ctrough) was \n9.8 mcg/ml (SD = 11.2 mcg/ml). \n \nDistribution \nBased on population pharmacokinetic modelling, the estimated mean steady-state volume of \ndistribution of brodalumab was approximately 7.24 L.  \n \nBiotransformation \nAs an IgG2 human monoclonal antibody brodalumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides \nand amino acids via catabolic pathways in a manner similar to endogenous IgG. \n \nElimination \nFollowing subcutaneous administrations of 210 mg, brodalumab exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics \ntypical for a monoclonal antibody that undergoes target-mediated drug disposition. \n \nBrodalumab clearance decreases with increasing dose and exposure increases in a greater than dose-\nproportional manner. For a 3-fold increase in SC brodalumab dose from 70 to 210 mg, the steady-state \nserum brodalumab Cmax and AUC0-t increased approximately 18- and 25-fold, respectively. \n \nFollowing a single subcutaneous administration of brodalumab 210 mg in plaque psoriasis patients, the \napparent clearance (CL/F) is 2.95 L/day.  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic modelling predicted that serum brodalumab concentrations dropped below \nthe quantification limit (0.05 mcg/ml) 63 days after discontinuation of steady-state dosing of \nbrodalumab 210 mg administered every 2 weeks in 95% of the patients. However, brodalumab \nconcentrations below LLOQ (Lower Limit of Quantification) were associated with IL-17 receptor \noccupancy up to 81%. \nBased on population pharmacokinetic modelling the estimated half-life of brodalumab was 10.9 days \nat steady-state after every other week subcutaneous dose of 210 mg. \n \nImpact of weight on pharmacokinetics \nPopulation pharmacokinetic modelling indicated that exposure decreased as body weight increased. \nNo dose adjustment is recommended. \n \nElderly patients \nPopulation pharmacokinetic modelling indicated that age did not have an effect on brodalumab \npharmacokinetics, which was co-based on 259 (6%) patients being 65-74 years old and on 14 (0.3%) \npatients being \u226575 years old, within a total PK population of 4271 plaque psoriasis patients. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Renal \nelimination of intact brodalumab, an IgG monoclonal antibody, is expected to be low and of minor \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nconsequence. Brodalumab is expected to be mainly eliminated via catabolism and hepatic impairment \nis not expected to influence clearance. \n \nOther populations \nThe pharmacokinetics of brodalumab was similar between Japanese and non-Japanese patients with \npsoriasis. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that gender did not have an effect on brodalumab \npharmacokinetics. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \nA population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model, developed using all available data indicated \nthat at a dose of 210 mg every 2 weeks, 90% of all patients would be predicted to maintain a trough \nconcentration greater than the estimated IC90 value of 1.51 mcg/ml. Based on an exploratory \ndescriptive analysis, no relationship was observed between exposure and incidence of serious \ninfections and infestations, candida infections, viral infections, and suicidal ideation and behaviour \nevents. Exposure-response analysis indicates that higher brodalumab concentrations are related to \nbetter PASI and sPGA response. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity (including safety pharmacology endpoints and assessment of fertility-related endpoints), and \ntoxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies with brodalumab have not been conducted. However, there were no \nproliferative changes in cynomolgus monkeys administered weekly subcutaneous doses of brodalumab \nat 90 mg/kg for 6 months (AUC exposure 47-fold higher than in human patients receiving Kyntheum \n210 mg every 2 weeks). The mutagenic potential of brodalumab was not evaluated; however, \nmonoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. \n \nIn cynomolgus monkeys there were no effects on male and female reproductive organs and on sperm \ncount, motility and morphology following administration of brodalumab at dose levels up to 90 mg/kg \nonce weekly for 6 months, (AUC exposure up to 47-fold higher than in human patients receiving \nKyntheum 210 mg every 2 weeks). \n \nIn cynomolgus monkeys, no effects on embryo-foetal or postnatal (up to 6 months of age) \ndevelopment were observed when brodalumab was dosed subcutaneously throughout pregnancy at \nexposure levels up to 27-fold higher than those achieved in human patients receiving Kyntheum \n210 mg every 2 weeks based on the area under the concentration curve (AUC). Serum concentrations \nin monkey infants and in foetal rabbits indicated considerable passage of brodalumab from the mother \nto the foetus at the end of pregnancy.  \n \nIn cynomolgus monkeys, after weekly subcutaneous dosing of brodalumab at dose levels up to \n90 mg/kg for 6 months, brodalumab-related effects were limited to injection site reactions and \nmucocutaneous inflammation that was consistent with pharmacologic modulation of host surveillance \nto commensal microflora. There were no effects on peripheral blood immunophenotyping and the T-\ncell dependent antibody response assay. In a local tolerance test in rabbits, moderate to severe edema \nwas observed after subcutaneous injection of a formulation containing brodalumab at the clinical \nconcentration of 140 mg/ml. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nKyntheum 210 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nbrodalumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety \n\ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Kyntheum  is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Kyntheum \n3. How to use Kyntheum  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Kyntheum  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Kyntheum is and what it is used for \n \nKyntheum is a medicine that contains the active substance brodalumab. Brodalumab is a monoclonal \nantibody, a specialised type of protein that recognises and attaches to certain proteins in the body. \n \nBrodalumab belongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works \nby blocking the activity of IL-17 proteins, which are present at increased levels in diseases such as \npsoriasis. \n \nKyntheum is used to treat a skin condition called \u201cplaque psoriasis\u201d, which causes inflammation and \nscaly plaque formation on the skin. Kyntheum is used in adults with moderate to severe plaque \npsoriasis affecting large areas of the body. \n \nUsing Kyntheum will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and reducing psoriasis \nsigns and symptoms, such as itch, redness, scaling, burning, stinging, cracking, flaking and pain. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Kyntheum \n \nDo not use Kyntheum \n\u2022 if you are allergic to brodalumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice before using Kyntheum \n\u2022 if you have active Crohn\u2019s disease \n\u2022 if you have an infection which your doctor thinks is important (for example, active \n\ntuberculosis). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Kyntheum: \n\u2022 if you have an inflammatory disease affecting the gut named Crohn\u2019s disease \n\u2022 if you have an inflammation of the large intestine named ulcerative colitis \n\u2022 if you have ever had or are having suicidal thoughts or actions, depression, anxiety, or mood \n\nproblems \n\u2022 if you have an infection now or often get infections \n\u2022 if you have a long-term (chronic) infection  \n\u2022 if you have tuberculosis (TB), have had a positive TB test, or have been in close contact with \n\nsomeone with TB. You may be treated with another medicine for TB before you begin treatment \nwith Kyntheum \n\n\u2022 if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccination. You should not be given \ncertain types of vaccines (called \u2018live vaccines\u2019) while being treated with Kyntheum \n\n\u2022 if you have used Kyntheum during the last three months of your pregnancy, you should talk to \nyour doctor before vaccinating your baby \n\n\u2022 if you are receiving any other treatment for psoriasis, such as another immunosuppressant or \nphototherapy with ultraviolet (UV) light. \n\n \nAfter starting Kyntheum, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately: \n\u2022 if you have been told by your doctor that you have developed Crohn\u2019s disease \n\u2022 if you feel depressed, anxious, or have thoughts of suicide, or have unusual mood changes \n\u2022 if you have an infection or have any signs of infection listed in Section 4 \u201cPossible Side Effects\u201d \n\u2022 if you have been told you have tuberculosis. \n \nInflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis) \nStop using IL-17 inhibitors, such as Kyntheum, and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately \nif you notice abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool (any signs of \nbowel problems). \n \nLook out for allergic reactions \nKyntheum can potentially cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions. You must look out \nfor signs of these conditions while you are taking Kyntheum. \n \nStop using Kyntheum and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs \nindicating an allergic reaction. Such signs are listed under \u201cSerious side effects\u201d in section 4. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nKyntheum is not recommended for children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) because it has not \nbeen studied in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Kyntheum \nTell your doctor or pharmacist: \n\u2022 if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines \n\u2022 if you have recently had or you or your baby are going to have a vaccination, see \"Warnings and \n\nprecautions\" in section \"2. What you need to know before using Kyntheum\". \n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Kyntheum has not been tested in \npregnant women and it is not known if this medicine can harm your unborn baby. It is therefore \npreferable to avoid the use of Kyntheum during pregnancy. If you are a woman of childbearing \npotential, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and should use adequate contraception while \nusing Kyntheum and for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of Kyntheum. \n  \nIt is not known whether brodalumab passes into breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding \nor plan to breast-feed. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or stop \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nusing Kyntheum. Together you will consider the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit \nof Kyntheum to you. \n \nDriving and using machines \nKyntheum has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use Kyntheum \n \nKyntheum should be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in diagnosing and treating \npsoriasis.  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  \n \nHow much Kyntheum is given \n\u2022 Your doctor will decide how much Kyntheum you need and for how long. The recommended \n\ndose is 210 mg (one injection). \n\u2022 After the first dose you will need to have a weekly injection at Week 1 (one week after the first \n\ndose) and Week 2 (two weeks after the first dose). After that, you will need to have an injection \nevery two weeks. \n\n\u2022 Kyntheum is for long-term treatment. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to \ncheck that the treatment is having the desired effect. Tell your doctor if you think your signs and \nsymptoms of psoriasis are not improving after using Kyntheum. \n\n \nHow is Kyntheum given \nKyntheum is given as an injection under the skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). \n \nSelf-administration instructions \nSee the detailed \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d that comes with this medicine for information on the right \nway to store, prepare, and give your injections at home. \n\u2022 If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver can give the injections at home, you or your \n\ncaregiver should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Kyntheum. Do not try to \ninject Kyntheum until you or your caregiver have been shown how to inject Kyntheum by your \ndoctor or nurse.  \n\n\u2022 Do not shake the pre-filled syringe before use. \n\u2022 Kyntheum is injected in your upper legs (thighs) or stomach area (abdomen) by you or a \n\ncaregiver. A caregiver may also give you an injection in your upper, outer arm. \n\u2022 Do not inject into an area of the skin that is tender, bruised, red, hard or in an area of skin that is \n\naffected by psoriasis. \n \nIf you use more Kyntheum than you should \nIf you use more of this medicine than prescribed or take the dose sooner than required, tell your \ndoctor.  \n \nIf you forget to use Kyntheum \nIf you have forgotten to inject a dose of Kyntheum, inject the next dose as soon as you can after the \nmissed dose. Then, talk to your doctor about when you should inject the next dose. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Kyntheum \nYou should not stop using Kyntheum without speaking to your doctor first. If you stop treatment, \nsymptoms of psoriasis may come back.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects  \n \nStop using Kyntheum and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you get any of the \nfollowing side effects. Your doctor will decide if and when you may restart the treatment: \n \nSerious allergic reaction (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people), the signs may include: \n\u2022 difficulty breathing or swallowing \n\u2022 low blood pressure, which can cause dizziness or light-headedness \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat \n\u2022 severe itching of the skin, with a red rash or raised bumps. \n \nPossible serious infections (may affect up to 1 in 100 people), the signs may include: \n\u2022 fever, flu-like symptoms, night sweats \n\u2022 feeling tired or short of breath, cough which will not go away \n\u2022 warm, red and painful skin, or a painful skin rash with blisters. \n\n \nOther side effects that have been reported \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 feeling sick \n\u2022 redness, pain, itching, bruising, or bleeding at injection site \n\u2022 tiredness \n\u2022 mouth or throat pain \n\u2022 tinea (fungal) skin infections (including on feet and groin) \n\u2022 flu (influenza) \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 joint pain  \n\u2022 muscle pain.  \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 candida (fungal) infection in the mouth, throat or genitals \n\u2022 discharge from the eye with itching, redness and swelling (conjunctivitis) \n\u2022 low white blood cell count. \n\n \nMost of these side effects are mild to moderate. If any of these side effects becomes severe, tell your \ndoctor, nurse, or pharmacist. \n \nAbdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool (signs of bowel problems) \nhave also been reported with IL-17 inhibitors, such as Kyntheum. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.

doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using kyntheum: if you have an inflammatory disease affecting the gut named crohn's disease if you have an inflammation of the large intestine named ulcerative colitis if you have ever had or are having suicidal thoughts or actions, depression, anxiety, or mood problems if you have an infection now or often get infections if you have a long-term (chronic) infection if you have tuberculosis (tb), have had a positive tb test, or have been in close contact with someone with tb. you may be treated with another medicine for tb before you begin treatment with kyntheum if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccination. you should not be given certain types of vaccines (called 'live vaccines') while being treated with kyntheum if you have used kyntheum during the last three months of your pregnancy, you should talk to your doctor before vaccinating your baby if you are receiving any other treatment for psoriasis, such as another immunosuppressant or phototherapy with ultraviolet (uv) light. after starting kyntheum, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately: if you have been told by your doctor that you have developed crohn's disease if you feel depressed, anxious, or have thoughts of suicide, or have unusual mood changes if you have an infection or have any signs of infection listed in section 4

doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool (any signs of bowel problems). look out for allergic reactions kyntheum can potentially cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions. you must look out for signs of these conditions while you are taking kyntheum. stop using kyntheum and tell your doctor or seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating an allergic reaction. such signs are listed under \"serious side effects\" in section 4. children and adolescents kyntheum is not recommended for children and adolescents (below 18 years of age) because it has not been studied in this age group. other medicines and kyntheum tell your doctor or pharmacist: if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines if you have recently had or you or your baby are going to have a vaccination, see \"warnings and precautions\" in section \"2. what you need to know before using kyntheum\". pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. kyntheum has not been tested in pregnant women and it is not known if this medicine can harm your unborn baby. it is therefore preferable to avoid the use of kyntheum during pregnancy. if you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and should use adequate contraception while using kyntheum and for at least 12 weeks after the last
