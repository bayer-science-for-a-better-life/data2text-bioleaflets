NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nOpatanol 1 mg/mL eye drops, solution \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne mL of solution contains 1 mg olopatadine (as hydrochloride). \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride 0.1 mg/ml. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nEye drops, solution (eye drops). \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of ocular signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe dose is one drop of Opatanol in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) twice daily (8 hourly). \n\nTreatment may be maintained for up to four months, if considered necessary. \n\n \n\nUse in elderly \n\nNo dosage adjustment in elderly patients is necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nOpatanol may be used in paediatric patients three years of age and older at the same dose as in adults. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Opatanol in children aged under 3 years has not been established. No data \n\nare available. \n\n \n\nUse in hepatic and renal impairment \n\nOlopatadine in the form of eye drops (Opatanol) has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic \n\ndisease. However, no dosage adjustment is expected to be necessary in hepatic or renal impairment \n\n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n3 \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor ocular use only. \n\n \n\nAfter the bottle cap is removed, if the tamper evident snap collar is loose, remove before using the \n\nproduct. To prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the \n\neyelids, surrounding areas, or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. Keep the bottle tightly \n\nclosed when not in use. \n\n \n\nIn case of concomitant therapy with other topical ocular medicines, an interval of five minutes should \n\nbe allowed between successive applications. Eye ointments should be administered last. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nOpatanol is an antiallergic/antihistaminic agent and, although administered topically, is absorbed \n\nsystemically. If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nOpatanol contains benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation. \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride has also been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative \n\nkeratopathy. Close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use in dry eye patients, or in \n\nconditions where the cornea is compromised. \n\n \n\nContact lenses \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium is known to discolour soft contact lenses. Avoid contact with soft contact lenses. \n\nPatients should be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to administration of the eye drop and wait \n\nat least15 minutes after instillation before re-inserting contact lenses. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies have shown that olopatadine did not inhibit metabolic reactions which involve \n\ncytochrome P-450 isozymes 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. These results indicate that \n\nolopatadine is unlikely to result in metabolic interactions with other concomitantly administered \n\nactive substances. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ophthalmic olopatadine in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration (see \n\nsection 5.3). \n\n \n\nOlopatadine is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \n\ncontraception. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n4 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nAvailable data in animals have shown excretion of olopatadine in milk following oral administration \n\n(for details see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nA risk to the newborn/infants cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nOpatanol should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nStudies have not been performed to evaluate the effect of topical ocular administration of olopatadine \n\non human fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nOpatanol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nAs with any eye drop, temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to \n\ndrive or use machines. If blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision \n\nclears before driving or using machinery. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies involving 1680 patients, Opatanol was administered one to four times daily in both \n\neyes for up to four months as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to loratadine 10 mg. Approximately \n\n4.5% of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions associated with the use of Opatanol; \n\nhowever, only 1.6% of patients discontinued from the clinical studies due to these adverse reactions. \n\nNo serious ophthalmic or systemic adverse reactions related to Opatanol were reported in clinical \n\nstudies. The most frequent treatment-related adverse reaction was eye pain, reported at an overall \n\nincidence of 0.7%. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n5 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies and post-marketing data \n\nand are classified according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common \n\n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000)very rare (<1/10,000) \n\nor not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \n\nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Classification Frequency Adverse Reactions \n\nInfections and infestations Uncommon rhinitis \n\nImmune system disorders Not known hypersensitivity, swelling face \n\nNervous system disorders Common headache, dysgeusia \n\n Uncommon dizziness, hypoaesthesia \n\n Not known somnolence \n\nEye disorders Common eye pain, eye irritation, dry eye, abnormal \n\nsensation in eyes \n\n Uncommon corneal erosion, corneal epithelium defect, \n\ncorneal epithelium disorder, punctate \n\nkeratitis, keratitis, corneal staining, eye \n\ndischarge, photophobia, vision blurred, \n\nvisual acuity reduced, blepharospasm, \n\nocular discomfort, eye pruritus, \n\nconjunctival follicles, conjunctival \n\ndisorder, foreign body sensation in eyes, \n\nlacrimation increased, erythema of eyelid, \n\neyelid oedema, eyelid disorder, ocular \n\nhyperaemia \n\n Not known corneal oedema, eye oedema, eye swelling, \n\nconjunctivitis, mydriasis, visual \n\ndisturbance, eyelid margin crusting \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon nasal dryness \n\n Not known dyspnoea, sinusitis \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Not known nausea, vomiting, \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon dermatitis contact, skin burning sensation, \n\ndry skin \n\n Not known dermatitis, erythema \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon fatigue \n\nNot known asthenia, malaise \n\n \n\nCases of corneal calcification have been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate \n\ncontaining eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n6 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo data are available in humans regarding overdose by accidental or deliberate ingestion. Olopatadine \n\nhas a low order of acute toxicity in animals. Accidental ingestion of the entire contents of a bottle of \n\nOpatanol would deliver a maximum systemic exposure of 5 mg olopatadine. This exposure would \n\nresult in a final dose of 0.5 mg/kg in a 10 kg infant, assuming 100% absorption. \n\n \n\nProlongation of the QTc interval in dogs was observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in \n\nexcess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. A 5 mg oral dose \n\nwas administered twice-daily for 2.5 days to 102 young and elderly male and female healthy \n\nvolunteers with no significant prolongation of QTc interval compared to placebo. The range of peak \n\nsteady-state olopatadine plasma concentrations (35 to 127 ng/ml) seen in this study represents at least \n\na 70-fold safety margin for topical olopatadine with respect to effects on cardiac repolarisation. \n\n \n\nIn the case of overdose, appropriate monitoring and management of the patient should be \n\nimplemented. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: ophthalmologicals; decongestant and antiallergics; other antiallergics, \n\nATC code: S01GX 09 \n\n \n\nOlopatadine is a potent selective antiallergic/antihistaminic agent that exerts its effects through \n\nmultiple distinct mechanisms of action. It antagonises histamine (the primary mediator of allergic \n\nresponse in humans) and prevents histamine induced inflammatory cytokine production by human \n\nconjunctival epithelial cells. Data from in vitro studies suggest that it may act on human conjunctival \n\nmast cells to inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. In patients with patent nasolacrimal \n\nducts, topical ocular administration of Opatanol was suggested to reduce the nasal signs and \n\nsymptoms that frequently accompany seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. It does not produce a clinically \n\nsignificant change in pupil diameter. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nOlopatadine is absorbed systemically, as are other topically administered medicinal products. \n\nHowever, systemic absorption of topically applied olopatadine is minimal with plasma concentrations \n\nranging from below the assay quantitation limit (<0.5 ng/ml) up to 1.3 ng/ml. These concentrations \n\nare 50-to 200-fold lower than those following well tolerated oral doses. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nFrom oral pharmacokinetic studies, the half-life of olopatadine in plasma was approximately eight to \n\n12 hours, and elimination was predominantly through renal excretion. Approximately 60-70% of the \n\ndose was recovered in the urine as active substance. Two metabolites, the mono-desmethyl and the N-\n\noxide, were detected at low concentrations in the urine. \n\n \n\nSince olopatadine is excreted in urine primarily as unchanged active substance, impairment of renal \n\nfunction alters the pharmacokinetics of olopatadine with peak plasma concentrations 2.3-fold greater \n\nin patients with severe renal impairment (mean creatinine clearance of 13.0 ml/min) compared to \n\nhealthy adults. Following a 10 mg oral dose in patients undergoing haemodialysis (with no urinary \n\noutput), plasma olopatadine concentrations were significantly lower on the haemodialysis day than on \n\nthe non-haemodialysis day suggesting olopatadine can be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n\n\n \n7 \n\n \n\nStudies comparing the pharmacokinetics of 10 mg oral doses of olopatadine in young (mean age \n\n21 years) and elderly (mean age 74 years) showed no significant differences in the plasma \n\nconcentrations (AUC), protein binding or urinary excretion of unchanged parent drug and metabolites. \n\n \n\nA renal impairment study after oral dosing of olopatadine has been performed in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment. The results indicate that a somewhat higher plasma concentration can be expected \n\nwith Opatanol in this population. Since plasma concentrations following topical ocular dosing of \n\nolopatadine are 50-to 200-fold lower than after well-tolerated oral doses, dose adjustment is not \n\nexpected to be necessary in the elderly or in the renally impaired population. Liver metabolism is a \n\nminor route of elimination. Dose adjustment is not expected to be necessary with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to \n\nreproduction. \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown reduced growth of nursing pups of dams receiving systemic doses of \n\nolopatadine well in excess of the maximum level recommended for human ocular use. Olopatadine \n\nhas been detected in the milk of nursing rats following oral administration. \n\n \n\n6.

What OPATANOL is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nOpatanol is used for the treatment of signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. \n\n \n\nAllergic conjunctivitis. Some materials (allergens) like pollens, house dust or animal fur may cause \n\nallergic reactions resulting in itching, redness as well as swelling of the surface of your eye. \n\n \n\nOpatanol is a medicine for treatment of allergic conditions of the eye. It works by reducing the \n\nintensity of the allergic reaction. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Opatanol \n\n \n\nDo not use Opatanol \n\n If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to olopatadine or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\n You should not use OPATANOL if you are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Opatanol. \n\n \n\nYou should remove contact lenses that are in your eyes before using Opatanol. \n\n \n\nChildren \n\nDo not use Opatanol in children under the age of 3 years. Do not give this medicine to children under \n\nthe ages of 3 years because there is no data to indicate that it is safe and work in children under \n\n3 years. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n18 \n\nOther medicines and Opatanol \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nIf you are using other eye drops or eye ointment medicines, leave at least 5 minutes between each \n\nmedicine. Eye ointments should be administered last. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a \n\nbaby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nYou should not use Opatanol if you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before using this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYou may find that your vision is blurred for a time just after you use Opatanol. Do not drive or use \n\nmachines until this has worn off. \n\n \n\nOpatanol contains Benzalkonium chloride \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains 0.5 mg benzalkonium chloride in each 5 ml which is equivalent to 0.1 mg/ml. \n\n \n\nThe preservative in Opatanol, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and \n\nmay change the colour of the contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this \n\nmedicine and put them back 15 minutes afterwards. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause eye \n\nirritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of the \n\neye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk to \n\nyour doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Opatanol \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one drop in the eye or eyes, twice a day, morning and evening. \n\n \n\nUse this much unless your doctor tells you to do differently. Only use Opatanol in both eyes if your \n\ndoctor told you to. Use it for as long as your doctor told you to. \n\n \n\nOpatanol should only be used as an eye drop. \n\n \n\nTURN THE PAGE FOR MORE ADVICE. \n\n \n\nNow turn over. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n19 \n\nHow to use Opatanol (continued) \n\n  \n 1 2 \n\n \n\nHow much to use \n\nsee side 1 \n\n \n\n Get the Opatanol bottle and a mirror. \n\n Wash your hands. \n\n Take the bottle and twist off the cap. \n\n After cap is removed, if the tamper evident snap collar is loose, remove before using the \n\nproduct. \n\n Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and middle finger. \n\n Tilt your head back. Pull down your eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a ‘pocket’ between \n\nthe eyelid and your eye. The drop will go in here (picture 1). \n\n Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Use the mirror if it helps. \n\n Don’t touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could \n\ninfect the drops left in the bottle. \n\n Gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of Opatanol at a time. \n\n Don’t squeeze the bottle, it is designed so that just a gentle press on the bottom is needed \n\n(picture 2). \n\n If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. \n\n Put the bottle cap back on firmly immediately after use. \n\n \n\nIf a drop misses your eye, try again. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Opatanol than you should \n\nRinse it all out with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until it’s time for your next regular \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Opatanol \n\nUse a single drop as soon as you remember, and then go back to your regular dosing routine. \n\nHowever, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose before going back to your \n\nregular dosing routine. Do not use a double dose to make up for the one missed. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Opatanol \n\nDo not stop using this medicine without first speaking to your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n20 \n\n4.
