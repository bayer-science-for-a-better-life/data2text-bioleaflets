This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFlucelvax Tetra - suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nInfluenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, prepared in cell cultures) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nInfluenza virus surface antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase), inactivated, of the following \nstrains*: \n \nA/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like strain (A/Nebraska/14/2019, wild type) 15 micrograms HA** \n\nA/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like strain (A/Delaware/39/2019, wild type) 15 micrograms HA** \n\nB/Washington/02/2019-like strain (B/Darwin/7/2019, wild type) 15 micrograms HA** \nB/Phuket/3073/2013-like strain (B/Singapore/INFTT-16-0610/2016, wild type) 15 micrograms HA** \n \nper 0.5 ml dose \n………………………………………. \n* propagated in Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells \n** haemagglutinin \n \nThe vaccine complies with the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation (northern \nhemisphere) and EU recommendation for the 2020/2021 season. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra may contain traces of beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and \npolysorbate 80.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection). \nClear to slightly opalescent liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in adults and children from 9 years of age.  \n \nFlucelvax Tetra should be used in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and children from 9 years of age: \n \nA single 0.5 ml dose.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Flucelvax Tetra in children from birth to less than 9 years of age has not \nbeen established. Currently available safety and immunogenicity data are described in sections 4.8 and \n5.1 but no recommendation on posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration  \n\nFor intramuscular injection only.  \nThe preferred site for injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.  \n \nThe vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be \nmixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. \n \nFor instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible \ntrace residues such as beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and polysorbate 80. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare \nanaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nVaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved.  \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, Flucelvax Tetra must be administered with caution to individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular \nadministration. \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient \nto prevent influenza. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with Flucelvax Tetra. There are no data available on co-\nadministration of Flucelvax Tetra with other vaccines. Based on clinical experience with cell-based \ntrivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc), Flucelvax Tetra can be given at the same time as other vaccines. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data from the use of Flucelvax Tetra in pregnant women. However, inactivated \ninfluenza vaccines can be used in all stages of pregnancy. For egg-derived influenza vaccines larger \ndatasets on safety are available for the second and third trimester, compared with the first trimester; \nhowever, data from worldwide use of influenza vaccine do not indicate any adverse foetal and \nmaternal outcomes attributable to the vaccine. \n \nThere are no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies with Flucelvax Tetra. Reproductive \nand developmental toxicology data from cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) do not predict \nan increased risk of developmental abnormalities. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether Flucelvax Tetra is excreted in human milk. No effects on breast fed \nnewborn/infant are anticipated. Flucelvax Tetra may be used during lactation. \n \nFertility \nNo human fertility data are available. Animal data, with cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc), \nhave not shown effects on female fertility. Male fertility has not been assessed in animals. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFlucelvax Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Flucelvax Tetra in adults 18 years and older was evaluated in a randomised, controlled \nstudy (V130_01), in which 1334 subjects received Flucelvax Tetra. Similar rates of solicited local and \nsystemic adverse reactions were reported in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra and cell-based \ntrivalent influenza vaccine comparator in this clinical trial. \n \nThe most commonly reported (≥10%) reactions in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra were pain at \nthe injection site (34%), headache (14%), fatigue (14%), myalgia (14%), erythema (13%) and \ninduration (10%). \n \nThe incidence of some adverse reactions were considerably lower among subjects ≥ 65 years of age \nwhen compared to subjects 18 to < 65 years of age (see table below).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: Very common \n(≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nTable 1:  Adverse reactions reported following vaccination in adults 18 years and older in \nclinical trials and post-marketing surveilance. \n\nMedDRA System Organ class Very common \n(≥1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100) \n\nFrequency  \nnot known3 \n\nImmune system disorders    Allergic or \nimmediate \nhypersensitivity \nreactions, including \nanaphylactic shock \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\n Loss of appetite   \n\nNervous system disorders Headache1   Paraesthesia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Nausea,  \nDiarrhoea,  \nVomiting2 \n\n  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n   Generalised skin \nreactions including \npruritus, urticaria or \nnon-specific rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nMyalgia1 Arthralgia   \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nInjection site pain, \nFatigue1,  \nErythema, \nInduration1  \n\nEcchymosis,  \nChills \n\nFever (≥ 38°C) Extensive swelling \nof injected limb   \n\n1 Reported as Common in the elderly population 65 years of age and older \n2 Reported as Uncommon in the elderly population 65 years of age and older \n3 Adverse reactions reported from post-marketing surveillance \n \nPaediatric population (9 to less than 18 years of age) \n \nThe safety of Flucelvax Tetra in children 4 to less than 18 years of age was evaluated in a randomised, \ncontrolled study (V130_03). In this study, 1159 paediatric subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (584 \nsubjects aged > 9 to < 18 years; 575 subjects aged > 4 to < 9 years). Children 9 to less than 18 years of \nage received a single dose of Flucelvax Tetra. Children 4 to less than 9 years of age received one or \ntwo doses (separated by 4 weeks) of Flucelvax Tetra based on determination of the subject’s prior \ninfluenza vaccination history. In this age group, 235 paediatric subjects received one dose and 340 \nsubjects received two doses. Similar rates of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were \nreported in subjects who received Flucelvax Tetra and cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine \ncomparator in this clinical trial.  \n \nThe most common (≥10%) adverse reactions reported in paediatric subjects of 9  to  < 18 years of age \nwere injection site pain (58%), headache (22%), erythema (19%), fatigue (18%), myalgia (16%), and \ninduration (15%). Similar rates of local and system adverse reactions were reported in the overall \npaediatric population 4 to < 18 years of age. \n \nCompared to adults 18 years of age and older, paediatric subjects generally reported higher rates of local \nand systemic adverse reactions. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nPaediatric Population (4 to less than 9 years of age) \n \nFlucelvax Tetra is not indicated for use in children less than 9 years of age, see section 4.2. The available \nsafety data in the paediatric population are presented below. \n \nChildren less than 9 years of age reported similar rates of adverse reactions compared to older children.  \n \nIn the paediatric population 4 to less than 6 years of age, the following additional solicited adverse \nreactions were reported: sleepiness (21%), irritability (19%) and change in eating habits (14%). \n \nIn children who received a second dose of Flucelvax Tetra or cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine, the \nincidence of adverse reactions following the second dose of vaccine was similar to that observed with \nthe first dose in this clinical trial. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are no data for overdose with Flucelvax Tetra. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFlucelvax Tetra provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and \ntwo B types) contained in the vaccine. Flucelvax Tetra induces humoral antibodies against the \nhaemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra is manufactured using Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. \n \nSpecific levels of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated \ninfluenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus. In some human \nstudies, antibody titres of 1:40 or greater have been associated with protection from influenza illness in \nup to 50% of subjects. \n \nAntibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. \nFurthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new \nantigenic variant of the same type or subtype.  \n \nAnnual revaccination with current influenza vaccines is recommended because immunity declines \nduring the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus may change from year to \nyear. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nImmunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra in Adults 18 years of age and older \nImmunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra was evaluated in adults 18 years of age and older in a randomised, \ndouble-blind, controlled study (V130_01). In this study, subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (N = 1334) \nor one of the two formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) [TIV1c \n(N = 677) or TIV2c (N = 669)]. The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens was assessed, \n21 days after vaccination. \n \nThe immunogenicity endpoints were geometric mean antibody titres (GMTs) of haemagglutination \ninhibition (HI) antibodies response and percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversions, defined \nas a pre-vaccination HI titre of <1:10 with a post vaccination titre ≥1:40 or with a prevaccination HI \ntitre of ≥10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in serum HI antibody titre. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra was non-inferior to TIVc. Non-inferiority was established for all 4 influenza strains \nincluded in Flucelvax Tetra, as assessed by ratios of GMTs and the differences in the percentages of \nsubjects achieving seroconversion at 3 weeks following vaccination. The antibody response to \ninfluenza B strains contained in Flucelvax Tetra was superior to the antibody response after \nvaccination with TIVc containing an influenza B strain from the alternate lineage. There was no \nevidence that the addition of the second influenza B strain resulted in immune interference to other \nstrains included in the vaccine. \n \nAge subgroup analyses in subjects 18 to less than 65 years of age and 65 years of age and above \nconfirmed that HI antibody responses (GMT and differences in vaccine group seroconversion rates) \nmet non-inferiority immunogenicity criteria 3 weeks following vaccination for all 4 influenza strains \nin both age groups. \n \nThe non-inferiority data observed are summarised in Table 2. \n \nTable 2:  Noninferiority of Flucelvax Tetra relative to TIVc in adults 18 years of age and above \n\n– Per protocol analysis set (V130_01) \n \n\n \n\nFlucelvax Tetra \nN = 1250 \n\nTIV1c/TIV2ca \nN = 635/N = 639 \n\nVaccine Group \nRatio \n\n(95% CI) \n\nVaccine \nGroup \n\nDifference \n(95% CI) \n\nA\n/H\n\n1N\n1 GMT \n\n(95% CI) \n302.8 \n\n(281.8-325.5) \n298.9 \n\n(270.3-330.5) \n1.0 \n\n(0.9-1.1) - \n\nSeroconversion \nRateb (95% CI) \n\n49.2% \n(46.4-52.0) \n\n48.7% \n(44.7-52.6) - \n\n-0.5% \n(-5.3-4.2) \n\nA\n/H\n\n3N\n2 GMT \n\n(95% CI) \n372.3 \n\n(349.2-396.9) \n378.4 \n\n(345.1-414.8) \n1.0 \n\n(0.9-1.1) - \n\nSeroconversion \nRateb (95% CI) \n\n38.3% \n(35.6-41.1) \n\n35.6% \n(31.9-39.5) - \n\n-2.7% \n(-7.2-1.9) \n\nB\n1 \n\nGMT \n(95% CI) \n\n133.2 \n(125.3-141.7) \n\n115.6 \n(106.4-125.6) \n\n0.9 \n(0.8-1.0) - \n\nSeroconversion \nRateb (95% CI) \n\n36.6% \n(33.9-39.3) \n\n34.8% \n(31.1-38.7) - \n\n-1.8% \n(-6.2-2.8) \n\nB\n2 \n\nGMT \n(95% CI) \n\n177.2 \n(167.6-187.5) \n\n164.0 \n(151.4-177.7) \n\n0.9 \n(0.9-1.0) - \n\nSeroconversion \nRateb (95% CI) \n\n39.8% \n(37.0-42.5) \n\n35.4% \n(31.7-39.2) - \n\n-4.4% \n(-8.9-0.2) \n\nAbbreviations: GMT = geometric mean titre; CI = confidence interval.  \na The comparator vaccine for noninferiority comparisons for A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B1 is TIV1c, for B2 it is \nTIV2c. \nb Seroconversion rate = percentage of subjects with either a pre-vaccination HI titre <1:10 and post-vaccination \nHI titre ≥1:40 or with a pre-vaccination HI titre ≥1:10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI \nantibody titre. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nBold = Non-inferiority criterion met. \n \nClinical efficacy of cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) against culture-confirmed influenza \nin adults \n \nThe efficacy experience with TIVc is relevant to Flucelvax Tetra because both vaccines are \nmanufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.  \n \nA multinational, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (V58P13) was performed to \nassess clinical efficacy and safety of TIVc during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults aged 18 to \nless than 50 years. A total of 11,404 subjects were enrolled to receive TIVc (N = 3828), Agrippal \n(N = 3676) or placebo (N = 3900) in a 1:1:1 ratio.  \n\nTIVc efficacy was defined as the prevention of culture-confirmed symptomatic influenza illness \ncaused by viruses antigenically matched to those in the vaccine compared to placebo. Influenza cases \nwere identified by active and passive surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was defined \naccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition, i.e., a fever (oral \ntemperature ≥100.0°F / 38°C) and cough or sore throat. After an episode of ILI, nose and throat swab \nsamples were collected for analysis. Vaccine efficacies against vaccine-matched influenza viral \nstrains, against all influenza viral strains, and against individual influenza viral subtypes were \ncalculated (Table 3). \n \nTable 3:  Comparative efficacy of TIVc versus placebo against culture-confirmed influenza by \n\ninfluenza viral subtype (V58P13) \n TIVc \n\n(N = 3776) \nPlacebo \n\n(N = 3843) \nVaccine Efficacy* \n\n Attack Rate \n(%) \n\nNumber of \nSubjects with \n\nInfluenza \n\nAttack Rate \n(%) \n\nNumber of \nSubjects with \n\nInfluenza \n\n% Lower Limit \nof One-\n\nSided 97.5% \nCI \n\nAntigenically Matched Strains \n\nOverall 0.19 7 1.14 44 83.8 61.0 \n\nIndividual \nstrains \n\nA/H3N2** 0.05  2 0 0 -- -- \n\nA/H1N1 0.13 5 1.12 43 88.2 67.4 \n\nB** 0 0 0.03 1 -- -- \n\nAll Culture-Confirmed Influenza \n\nOverall 1.11 42 3.64 140 69.5 55.0 \n\nIndividual \nstrains \n\nA/H3N2 0.16 6 0.65 25 75.6 35.1 \n\nA/H1N1 0.16 6 1.48 57 89.3 73.0 \n\nB 0.79 30 1.59 61 49.9 18.2 \n*  Simultaneous one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals for the vaccine efficacy of each influenza vaccine \n\nrelative to placebo based on the Sidak-corrected score confidence intervals for the two relative risks.  \nVaccine Efficacy = (1 - Relative Risk) x 100%; \n\n**  There were too few cases of influenza due to vaccine-matched influenza A/H3N2 or B to adequately assess \nvaccine efficacy. \n\n \nPaediatric population  \n \nImmunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra in Children and Adolescents 9 to less than 18 Years of Age \n \nImmunogenicity of Flucelvax Tetra was evaluated in children 9 to less than 18 years of age as part of a \nrandomised, double-blind, controlled study (V130_03) that was performed in the paediatric population \n4 to less than 18 years of age. In this study, subjects received Flucelvax Tetra (N = 1159) or one of the \ntwo formulations of comparator cell-based trivalent influenza vaccine (TIVc) [TIV1c (N = 593), or \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nTIV2c (N = 580)]. The immune response to each of the vaccine antigens was assessed 21 days after \nvaccination. \nThe immunogenicity endpoints were GMTs of HI antibodies response and percentage of subjects who \nachieved seroconversions (seroconversion rate), defined as a pre-vaccination HI titre of <1:10 with a \npost-vaccination titre ≥1:40 or with a pre-vaccination HI titre ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4-fold increase in \nserum HI antibody titre. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra was noninferior to TIVc in children 4 to less than 18 years of age.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Flucelvax Tetra is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you receive Flucelvax Tetra  \n3. How Flucelvax Tetra is given  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Flucelvax Tetra   \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Flucelvax Tetra is and what it is used for \n \nFlucelvax Tetra is a vaccine against flu (influenza). Flucelvax Tetra is prepared in cell cultures, and, \ntherefore, is egg-free. \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu. \n \nFlucelvax Tetra is used to prevent flu in adults and children from 9 years of age. \n \nThe vaccine targets four strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World \nHealth Organisation for the 2020/2021 season. \n \n \n2.
