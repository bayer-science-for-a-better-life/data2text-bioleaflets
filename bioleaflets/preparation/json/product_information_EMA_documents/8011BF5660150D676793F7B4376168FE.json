PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection (powder for injection). \n \nThe powder is white to slightly off-white. \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1.  Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult patients with acromegaly who have had an inadequate response to surgery and/or \nradiation therapy and in whom an appropriate medical treatment with somatostatin analogues did not \nnormalize IGF-I concentrations or was not tolerated. \n \n4.2.  Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nacromegaly. \n \nPosology \n \nA loading dose of 80 mg pegvisomant should be administered subcutaneously under medical \nsupervision. Following this, SOMAVERT 10 mg reconstituted in 1 ml of solvent should be \nadministered once daily as a subcutaneous injection. \n \nDose adjustments should be based on serum IGF-I levels. Serum IGF-I concentrations should be \nmeasured every four to six weeks and appropriate dose adjustments made in increments of 5 mg/day in \norder to maintain the serum IGF-I concentration within the age-adjusted normal range and to maintain \nan optimal therapeutic response. \n \nAssessment of baseline levels of liver enzymes prior to initiation of SOMAVERT \nPrior to the start of SOMAVERT, patients should have an assessment of baseline levels of liver tests \n(LTs) [serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total bilirubin \n(TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)]. For recommendations regarding initiation of SOMAVERT \nbased on baseline LTs and recommendations for monitoring of LTs while on SOMAVERT, refer to \nTable A in Special warnings and precautions for use (4.4). \n \nThe maximum dose should not exceed 30 mg/day. \n \nFor the different dose regimens, the following strengths are available: SOMAVERT 10 mg, \nSOMAVERT 15 mg, SOMAVERT 20 mg, SOMAVERT 25 mg and SOMAVERT 30 mg. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of SOMAVERT in children aged 0 to 17 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of SOMAVERT in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency has not been \nestablished. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPegvisomant should be administered by subcutaneous injection. \n\n\n\n 4\n\n \nThe site of injection should be rotated daily to help prevent lipohypertrophy. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3.  Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4.  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGrowth hormone-secreting tumours \n \nGrowth hormone-secreting pituitary tumours may sometimes expand, causing serious complications \n(for example, visual field defects). Treatment by pegvisomant does not reduce tumour size. All \npatients with these tumours should be carefully monitored in order to avoid any eventual progression \nin tumour size under treatment. \n \nSerum IGF-1 monitoring \n \nPegvisomant is a potent antagonist of growth hormone action. A growth hormone deficient state may \nresult from administration of this medicinal product, despite the presence of elevated serum growth \nhormone levels. Serum IGF-I concentrations should be monitored and maintained within the \nage-adjusted normal range by adjustment of the pegvisomant dose. \n \nALT or AST elevations \n \nPrior to the start of SOMAVERT, patients should have an assessment of baseline levels of liver tests \n[serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total bilirubin \n(TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)].  \nEvidence of obstructive biliary tract disease should be ruled out in patients with elevations of ALT and \nAST or in patients with a prior history of treatment with any somatostatin analogue. Administration of \npegvisomant should be discontinued if signs of liver disease persist. \nFor recommendations regarding initiation of SOMAVERT, based on baseline liver tests (LTs) and \nrecommendations for monitoring of liver tests while on SOMAVERT, refer to Table A. \n \n\n\n\n 5\n\nTable A: Recommendations for initiation of SOMAVERT treatment based on baseline LTs and \nfor periodic monitoring of LTs during SOMAVERT treatment \n\nBaseline LT Levels Recommendations\n\nNormal \n\n May treat with SOMAVERT.  \n Serum concentrations of ALT and AST should be \n\nmonitored at 4- to 6-week intervals for the first 6 months \nof treatment with SOMAVERT, or at any time in patients \nexhibiting symptoms suggestive of hepatitis. \n\nElevated, but less than or \nequal to 3 times ULN \n\n May treat with SOMAVERT; however, monitor LTs \nmonthly for at least 1 year after initiation of therapy and \nthen bi-annually for the next year.\n\nGreater than 3 times ULN \n\n Do not treat with SOMAVERT until a comprehensive \nworkup establishes the cause of the patient’s liver \ndysfunction. \n\n Determine if cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis is \npresent, particularly in patients with a history of prior \ntherapy with somatostatin analogs.  \n\n Based on the workup, consider initiation of therapy with \nSOMAVERT.  \n\n If the decision is to treat, LTs and clinical symptoms \nshould be monitored very closely.\n\nAbbreviations: ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate transaminase; LT = liver test; \nULN = upper limit of normal. \n \nIf a patient develops LT elevations, or any other signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction while \nreceiving SOMAVERT, the following patient management is recommended (Table B). \n \nTable B. Clinical recommendations based on abnormal liver test results while on SOMAVERT \n \n\nLT Levels and Clinical \nSigns/Symptoms \n\nRecommendations \n\nElevated, but less than or equal to \n3 times ULN \n\n May continue therapy with SOMAVERT. However, monitor \nLTs monthly to determine if further increases occur. \n\nGreater than 3 but less than 5 times \nULN (without signs/symptoms of \nhepatitis or other liver injury, or \nincrease in serum TBIL)  \n\n May continue therapy with SOMAVERT. However, monitor \nLTs weekly to determine if further increases occur (see \nbelow). \n\n Perform a comprehensive hepatic workup to discern if  an \nalternative cause of liver dysfunction is present.  \n\nAt least 5 times ULN, or transaminase \nelevations at least 3 times ULN \nassociated with any increase in serum \nTBIL (with or without \nsigns/symptoms of hepatitis or other \nliver injury) \n\n Discontinue SOMAVERT immediately. \n Perform a comprehensive hepatic workup, including serial \n\nLTs, to determine if and when serum levels return to normal. \n If LTs normalize (regardless of whether an alternative cause \n\nof the liver dysfunction is discovered), consider cautious \nreinitiation of therapy with SOMAVERT, with frequent LT \nmonitoring.\n\nSigns or symptoms suggestive of \nhepatitis or other liver injury (e.g., \njaundice, bilirubinuria, fatigue, \nnausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant \npain, ascites, unexplained oedema, \neasy bruisability)  \n\n Immediately perform a comprehensive hepatic workup.  \n If liver injury is confirmed, the drug should be discontinued. \n\n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nThe study conducted with pegvisomant in diabetic patients treated either by insulin or by oral \nhypoglycaemic medicinal products revealed the risk of hypoglycaemia in this population. Therefore, \n\n\n\n 6\n\nin acromegalic patients with diabetes mellitus, doses of insulin or hypoglycaemic medicinal products \nmay need to be decreased (see section 4.5). \n \nImproved fertility \n \nThe therapeutic benefits of a reduction in IGF-I concentration which results in improvement of the \npatient’s clinical condition could potentially also improve fertility in female patients (see section 4.6). \n \nPregnancy \n \nAcromegaly control may improve during pregnancy. Pegvisomant is not recommended during \npregnancy (see section 4.6). If pegvisomant is used during pregnancy, IGF-I levels should be closely \nmonitored and pegvisomant doses may need to be adjusted (see section 4.2) based on IGF-I values. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. Patients on low sodium \ndiets can be informed that this medicinal product is essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5.  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. It should be considered whether to continue treatment \nwith somatostatin analogues. The use of this medicine in combination with other medicinal products \nfor the treatment of acromegaly has not been extensively investigated. \n \nPatients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products may require dose reduction of \nthese active substances due to the effect of pegvisomant on insulin sensitivity (see section 4.4). \n \nPegvisomant has significant structural similarity to growth hormone which causes it to cross-react in \ncommercially available growth hormone assays. Since serum concentrations of \ntherapeutically-effective doses of this medicine are generally 100 to 1000 times higher than the actual \nserum growth hormone concentrations seen in acromegalics, measurements of serum growth hormone \nconcentrations will be spuriously reported in commercially available growth hormone assays. \nPegvisomant treatment should therefore not be monitored or adjusted based on serum growth hormone \nconcentrations reported from these assays. \n \n4.6.  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of pegvisomant in pregnant women. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nSOMAVERT is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nIf pegvisomant is used during pregnancy, IGF-I levels should be closely monitored, especially during \nthe first trimester. It may be necessary to adjust the dose of pegvisomant during pregnancy (see section \n4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThe excretion of pegvisomant in breast milk has not been studied in animals. Clinical data are too \nlimited (one reported case) to draw any conclusion on the excretion of pegvisomant in human breast \nmilk. Therefore, pegvisomant should not be used in breast-feeding women. However, breast-feeding \nmay be continued if this medicine is discontinued: this decision should take into account the benefit of \npegvisomant therapy to the mother and the benefit of breast-feeding to the child. \n\n\n\n 7\n\n \nFertility \n \nFor pegvisomant no data on fertility are available. \n \nThe therapeutic benefits of a reduction in IGF-I concentration which results in improvement of the \npatient’s clinical condition could potentially also improve fertility in female patients. \n \n4.7.  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8.  Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe list below contains adverse reactions seen in clinical trials with SOMAVERT. \n \nIn clinical studies, for patients treated with pegvisomant (n=550), the majority of adverse reactions to \npegvisomant were of mild to moderate intensity, of limited duration and did not require \ndiscontinuation of treatment. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions occurring in  10% of patients with acromegaly \ntreated with pegvisomant during the clinical trials were headache 25%, arthralgia 16% and diarrhoea \n13%. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe list below contains adverse reactions seen in clinical trials or that were spontaneously reported, \nclassified by system organ class and frequency. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to the following categories: \nVery common: 1/10 \nCommon:  1/100 to <1/10 \nUncommon:  1/1,000 to <1/100 \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nSystem Organ Class Very \n\nCommon \n(≥1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥1/100 \n\nto <1/10) \n \n\nUncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to < \n\n1/100) \n \n\nFrequency \nNot Known \n(Cannot Be \nEstimated \n\nFrom \nAvailable \n\nData)\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n  thrombocytopenia, \nleukopenia, \nleukocytosis, \nhaemorrhagic \ndiathesis\n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  hypersensitivity \nreactionsb \n\nanaphylactic \nreactionb, \nanaphylactoid \nreactionb \n\n\n\n 8\n\nSystem Organ Class Very \nCommon \n(≥1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥1/100 \n\nto <1/10) \n \n\nUncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to < \n\n1/100) \n \n\nFrequency \nNot Known \n(Cannot Be \nEstimated \n\nFrom \nAvailable \n\nData)\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n hypercholesterol\naemia, \nhyperglycaemia, \nhypoglycaemia, \nweight increased\n\nhypertriglyceridemia  \n\nPsychiatric disorders  abnormal dreams panic attack, short \nterm memory loss, \napathy, confusion, \nsleep disorder, libido \nincreased\n\nanger \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nheadache somnolence, \ntremor, \ndizziness, \nhypoaesthesia\n\nnarcolepsy, migraine, \ndysgeusia \n\n \n\nEye disorders  eye pain asthenopia  \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n  Meniere’s disease  \n\nCardiac disorders  oedema \nperipheral\n\n  \n\nVascular disorders   hypertension   \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n dyspnoea  laryngospasmb \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\ndiarrhoea vomiting, \nconstipation, \nnausea, \nabdominal \ndistension, \ndyspepsia, \nflatulence\n\nhaemorrhoids, \nsalivary \nhypersecretion, dry \nmouth, tooth \ndisorder \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n abnormal liver \nfunction tests \n(e.g. \ntransaminase \nelevation) (see \nsection 4.4)\n\n  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n hyperhidrosis, \ncontusion, \npruritusb, rashb \n\nface oedema, dry \nskin, increased \ntendency to bruise, \nnight sweats, \nerythemab, urticariab \n\nangioedemab \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\narthralgia  myalgia, arthritis   \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n haematuria proteinuria, polyuria, \nrenal impairment\n\n \n\n\n\n 9\n\nSystem Organ Class Very \nCommon \n(≥1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥1/100 \n\nto <1/10) \n \n\nUncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to < \n\n1/100) \n \n\nFrequency \nNot Known \n(Cannot Be \nEstimated \n\nFrom \nAvailable \n\nData)\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions  \n\n injection site \nreaction \n(including \ninjection site \nhypersensitivity), \ninjection site \nbruising or \nbleeding, \ninjection site \nhypertrophy \n(e.g. lipohypertro\nphy)a, \ninfluenza-like \nillness, fatigue, \nasthenia, pyrexia \n\nfeeling abnormal, \nimpaired healing, \nhunger \n\n \n\na see Description of selected adverse reactions below \nb ADR related to hypersensitivity reaction \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMost injection site reactions characterised as localised erythemas and soreness, spontaneously \nresolved with local symptomatic treatment, while pegvisomant therapy continued. Occurrence of \ninjection site hypertrophy has been observed, including lipohypertrophy. \n \nThe development of isolated low-titre anti-growth hormone antibodies was observed in 16.9% of \npatients treated with pegvisomant. The clinical significance of these antibodies is unknown. \n \nSystemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, laryngospasm, \nangioedema, generalized skin reactions (rash, erythema, pruritus, urticaria) have been reported in post \nmarketing use. Some patients required hospitalization. Upon re-administration, symptoms did not \nre-occur in all patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9.  Overdose \n \nThere is limited experience of overdose with pegvisomant. In the one reported incident of acute \noverdose, where 80 mg/day was administered for 7 days, the patient experienced a slight increase in \nfatigue and dry mouth. In the week following discontinuation of treatment the adverse reactions noted \nwere: insomnia, increased fatigue, oedema peripheral, tremor, and weight gain. Two weeks after \nstopping treatment, leukocytosis and moderate bleeding from injection and vein puncture sites was \nobserved which were considered possibly related to pegvisomant. \n \nIn cases of overdose, administration of this medicine should be discontinued and not resumed until \nIGF-I levels return to within or above the normal range. \n\n\n\n 10\n\n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1.  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues, ATC code: \nH01AX01. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nPegvisomant is an analogue of human growth hormone that has been genetically modified to be a \ngrowth hormone receptor antagonist. Pegvisomant binds to growth hormone receptors on cell surfaces, \nwhere it blocks growth hormone binding, and thus interferes with intracellular growth hormone signal \ntransduction. Pegvisomant is highly selective for the GH receptor, and does not cross-react with other \ncytokine receptors, including prolactin. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nInhibition of growth hormone action with pegvisomant leads to decreased serum concentrations of \ninsulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), as well as other growth hormone-responsive serum proteins such \nas free IGF-I, the acid-labile subunit of IGF-I (ALS), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 \n(IGFBP-3).  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAcromegalic patients (n=112) have been treated in a 12-week, randomised, double-blind, multicentre \nstudy comparing placebo and pegvisomant. Dose-dependent, statistically significant reductions in \nmean IGF-I (p<0.0001), free IGF-I (p<0.05), IGFBP-3 (p<0.05) and ALS (p<0.05) were observed at \nall post-baseline visits in the pegvisomant treatment groups. The serum IGF-1 was normalised at the \nend of the study (week 12) in 9.7%, 38.5%, 75% and 82% of subjects treated with placebo, 10 mg/day, \n15 mg/day or 20 mg/day pegvisomant respectively.  \n \nStatistically significant differences from placebo (p<0.05) were observed for improvements in the total \nsigns and symptoms score for all dose groups compared to placebo. \n \nA cohort of 38 acromegalic subjects has been followed in a long-term, open-label, dose-titration study \nfor at least 12 consecutive months of daily dosing with pegvisomant (mean = 55 weeks). The mean \nIGF-I concentration in this cohort fell from 917 ng/ml to 299 ng/ml on pegvisomant, with 92% \nachieving a normal (age-adjusted) IGF-I concentration. \n \n5.2.  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAbsorption of pegvisomant following subcutaneous administration is slow and prolonged, and peak \nserum pegvisomant concentrations are not generally attained until 33-77 hours after administration. \nThe mean extent of absorption of a subcutaneous dose was 57% relative to an intravenous dose. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of pegvisomant is relatively small (7-12 L). \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe metabolism of pegvisomant has not been studied. \n \n\n\n\n 11\n\nElimination \n \nThe mean total body systemic clearance of pegvisomant following multiple doses is estimated to be \n28 ml/h for subcutaneous doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg/day. Renal clearance of pegvisomant is \nnegligible and accounts for less than 1% of total body clearance. Pegvisomant is slowly eliminated \nfrom serum, with mean estimates of half-life generally ranging from 74 to 172 hours following either \nsingle or multiple-doses. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nAfter single subcutaneous pegvisomant administration no linearity is observed with rising doses of \n10, 15 or 20 mg. Approximately linear pharmacokinetics is observed at steady state in the population \npharmacokinetic studies. The data from 145 patients in two long-term studies who received daily \ndoses of 10, 15, or 20 mg, demonstrate pegvisomant mean serum concentrations (± SD) of \napproximately 8800 ± 6300, 13200 ± 8000 and 15600 ± 10300 ng/ml, respectively. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of pegvisomant are similar in normal healthy volunteers and acromegaly \npatients, although heavier individuals tend to have a higher total body clearance of pegvisomant than \nlighter individuals, and may thus require greater doses of pegvisomant. \n \n5.3.  Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on studies of repeated dose toxicity in \nrat and monkey. However, due to the marked pharmacological response in monkey, systemic \nexposures higher than those achieved in patients at therapeutic doses have not been studied.  \n \nMalignant fibrous histiocytomas associated with fibrosis and histiocytic inflammation were observed \nat injection sites in males in the rat carcinogenicity study at exposure levels equivalent to three times \nthe human exposure based on mean plasma concentrations in two long-term studies at a daily dose of \n30 mg. The relevance of this response for humans is currently unknown. The increased incidence of \ninjection site tumours was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to \nrepeated subcutaneous injections. \n \nEarly embryonic development and embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in pregnant \nrabbits with pegvisomant at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of \nteratogenic effects associated with pegvisomant administration during organogenesis. At \n10 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum human therapeutic dose based on body surface area), an increase \nin post-implantation loss was observed in both studies. No fertility study has been conducted. \n \n \n6.  PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1.

Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts. \n\n\n\n 12\n\n \n6.3.  Shelf life \n \n3 years. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the product should be used immediately. \n \n6.4.  Special precautions for storage \n \nStore the powder vial(s) in a refrigerator (2C – 8C). Do not freeze. Keep the vial(s) in their carton(s) \nin order to protect from light. \n \nThe carton(s) containing the SOMAVERT powder vial(s) may be stored at room temperature up to a \nmaximum of 25°C for a single period of up to 30 days. The Use by date should be written on the \ncarton (up to 30 days from the date removed from the refrigerator). The vial(s) must be protected from \nlight and should not be placed back into the refrigerator. The  SOMAVERT powder vial(s) must be \ndiscarded if not used within the 30 days of room temperature storage or the expiry date printed on the \ncarton, whichever is earlier. \n \nStore the pre-filled syringe(s) below 30C or store in a refrigerator (2ºC - 8°C). Do not freeze. \n \nAfter reconstitution: \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5.  Nature and contents of container \n \n10 mg or 15 mg or 20 mg or 25 mg or 30 mg of pegvisomant in powder in a vial (type I flint glass) \nwith a stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) and 1 ml solvent (water for injections) in a pre-filled syringe \n(type I borosilicate glass) with a plunger stopper (bromobutyl rubber) and a tip cap (bromobutyl \nrubber). The colour of the protective plastic cap is specific to the strength of the product. \n \nSOMAVERT 10 mg and 15 mg \nPack size of 30 vials, pre-filled syringes and safety needles. \n \nSOMAVERT 20 mg, 25 mg and 30 mg \nPack sizes of 1 and 30 vial(s), pre-filled syringe(s) and safety needle(s) \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6.  Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe syringe and safety needle used to administer the injection are provided with the medicinal \nproduct. \n \n\n\n\n 13\n\nBefore attaching the supplied safety needle the syringe cap will need to be removed from the pre-filled \nsyringe. This is achieved by snapping it off. The syringe should be kept upright to avoid leakage and \nthe end of the syringe should not be allowed to contact anything. \n \n\n \n \nThe powder should be reconstituted with 1 ml solvent. When adding the solvent from the syringe the \nvial and syringe should held at an angle as shown in the diagram below. \n \n\n \n \nAdd the solvent to the vial of powder. The solvent should be emptied into the vial slowly to avoid the \npossibility of a foam forming. This would make the medicine unusable. Gently dissolve the powder \nwith a slow, swirling motion. Do not shake vigorously, as this might cause denaturation of the active \nsubstance. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the reconstituted solution should be inspected visually for extraneous (or for any \nforeign) particulate matter or any variation in physical appearance prior to administration. In the event \nof either being observed, discard the medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n 14\n\nBefore withdrawing the dissolved SOMAVERT invert the vial with the syringe still inserted into it \nand ensure the gap in the stopper can be seen as shown in the diagram below: \n\n \nPull the needle down so that the needle tip is at its lowest point in the liquid. Slowly withdraw the \nplunger in the syringe to withdraw the medicine from the vial. If air is seen in the syringe, tap the \nbarrel to float the bubbles to the top, and then gently push the bubbles out into the vial. \n \nBefore disposing of the syringe and needle fold the needle guard over the needle and ensure it clicks \ninto place. The syringe and needle should never be reused. \n \nFor single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in \naccordance with local requirements.  \n \n \n7.

What SOMAVERT is and what it is used for  \n \nSOMAVERT is used for the treatment of acromegaly, a hormonal disorder resulting from the \nincreased secretion of growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I (Insulin-like growth factors), which is \ncharacterised by overgrowth of bone, soft tissue swelling, heart disease and related disorders. \n \nThe active substance in SOMAVERT, pegvisomant is known as a growth hormone receptor \nantagonist. These substances decrease the action of GH and levels of IGF-I circulating in the blood. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use SOMAVERT \n \nDo not use SOMAVERT \n If you are allergic to pegvisomant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using SOMAVERT. \n \n- If you experience disturbed vision or headaches while using SOMAVERT you must contact \n\nyour doctor immediately. \n \n- Your doctor or nurse will monitor the levels of IGF-I (Insulin-like growth factors) circulating in \n\nthe blood and adjust the dose of SOMAVERT if necessary. \n \n- Your doctor should also monitor your adenoma (benign tumour). \n \n\n\n\n 62\n\n- Your doctor will conduct tests of your liver function before starting and during treatment with \nSOMAVERT. If these test results are not normal, your doctor will discuss treatment options \nwith you. Once treatment begins, your doctor or nurse will monitor the level of liver enzymes in \nthe blood every 4-6 weeks for the first 6 months of treatment with SOMAVERT. Administration \nof SOMAVERT should be discontinued if signs of liver disease persist. \n\n \n- If you are diabetic, your doctor may need to adjust the amount of insulin or other medicines you \n\nare using. \n \n- Fertility in women patients may be increased as the disease improves. The use of this medicine \n\nin pregnant women is not recommended and women of childbearing age should be advised to \nuse a contraception. See also the section about Pregnancy below. \n\n \nOther medicines and SOMAVERT \nYou must tell your doctor if you have previously used other medicines for the treatment of acromegaly \nor medicines for the treatment of diabetes. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used any other medicines. \n \nAs part of your treatment you may be given other medicines. It is important to keep using all your \nmedicines as well as SOMAVERT unless you are told otherwise by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nThe use of SOMAVERT in pregnant women is not recommended. If you are a women of childbearing \nage, a contraception should be used during treatment.  \n \nIt is not known if pegvisomant passes into breast milk. You should not breast-feed while taking \nSOMAVERT unless your doctor has discussed this with you. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nSOMAVERT contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per dose i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use SOMAVERT \n \nAlways inject this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nA starting dose of 80 mg of pegvisomant will be given subcutaneously (just under the skin) by your \ndoctor. Following this, the usual daily dose of pegvisomant is 10 mg, which is given by subcutaneous \ninjection (just under the skin). \n \nEvery four to six weeks your doctor will make appropriate dose adjustments, made in increments of \n5 mg pegvisomant/day, based on your so-called serum IGF-I levels to maintain an optimal therapeutic \nresponse.  \n \n\n\n\n 63\n\nMethod and route of administration \nSOMAVERT is injected under the skin. The injection can be self-administered or given by another \nperson, for example your doctor or his/her assistant. The detailed instructions on injection procedure \nprovided at the end of this leaflet must be followed. You should continue to inject this medicine for as \nlong as instructed by your doctor. \n \nThis medicine must be dissolved before use. The injection must not be mixed in the same syringe or \nvial as any other medicine. \n \nFatty tissue of the skin can build-up at the site of injection. To avoid this, use a slightly different place \nfor your injection each time, as described in Step 2 of the ‘instructions for preparing and giving an \ninjection of SOMAVERT’ section of this leaflet. This gives your skin and the area under your skin \ntime to recover from one injection before it receives another one in the same place. \n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of this medicine is too strong or too weak, talk to your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nIf you inject more SOMAVERT than you should \nIf you accidentally inject more SOMAVERT than told to by your doctor it is unlikely to be serious, \nbut you should contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use SOMAVERT \nIf you forget to give yourself an injection you should inject the next dose as soon as you remember \nand then continue to inject SOMAVERT as prescribed by your doctor. Do not inject a double dose to \nmake up for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMild to serious allergic (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in some patients taking \nSOMAVERT.

You must mix SOMAVERT with a liquid \n(diluent) before you can use it.  \nThe liquid comes in a pre-filled syringe labeled ‘Solvent for SOMAVERT’.  \nDo not use any other liquid to mix with SOMAVERT. \nIt is important that you do not try to give yourself or someone else an injection unless you have \nreceived training from your healthcare provider. \n \nStore the carton(s) of powder vials in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C and away from direct sunlight.  \nThe carton(s) containing the SOMAVERT powder vial(s) may be stored at room temperature up to a \nmaximum of 25°C for a single period of up to 30 days. Write the Use by date on the carton including \nday/month/year (up to 30 days from the date removed from the refrigerator). The vial(s) must be \nprotected from light. Do not return this medicine to refrigerator. \n \nDiscard this medicine if not used by the new Use by date or the expiry date printed on the carton, \nwhichever is earlier. \n \nThe pre-filled solvent syringe may be stored at room temperature. Keep out of reach of children. \n \n \n1. Things you need \n \nA single SOMAVERT pack containing: \n\n A vial of SOMAVERT powder. \n A pre-filled syringe with solvent. \n A safety needle. \n\nYou will also need: \n A cotton ball. \n An alcohol swab. \n A suitable sharps container. \n\n \n\n\n\n 69\n\n \n \n \n2. Getting ready \n \nBefore you start: \n\n Only mix SOMAVERT and the solvent when you are ready to inject your dose. \n Remove a single SOMAVERT pack from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room \n\ntemperature naturally in a safe place. \n Wash your hands with soap and water, and dry thoroughly.  \n Peel open the packaging of the syringe and safety needle to make it easier to pick up each \n\nitem as you prepare for your injection. \n Do not use the syringe or vial if:   \n\no they are damaged or faulty;  \no the expiration date has passed;  \no it has been frozen, even if it has now thawed (syringe only). \n\n \n \n3. Choose injection area \n \n\n \n \n\n Choose a different location within an area for each injection.  \n Avoid bony areas or areas that are bruised, red, sore or hard, or areas that have scars or \n\nskin conditions.  \n\n\n\n 70\n\n Clean the injection area with the alcohol swab as instructed by your healthcare provider. \n Allow the injection area to dry. \n\n \n \n4. Remove vial cap \n \n\n \n \n\n Remove the cap from the vial. \n Throw the cap away; it is not needed again. \n\nCaution: Do not let anything touch the vial stopper. \n \n \n5. Remove syringe cap \n \n\n \n \n\n Snap off the syringe cap. It may take more effort to snap off than you might expect. \n Throw the syringe cap away; it is not needed again. \n Keep the syringe upright to avoid leakage. \n\nCaution: Do not let the end of the syringe touch anything when the syringe cap is off. \n \n \n\n\n\n 71\n\n6. Attach safety needle \n \n\n \n \n\n Twist the safety needle firmly onto the syringe as far as it will go. \n \n \n7. Remove needle cover \n \n\n \n \n\n Fold the needle guard out of the way of the needle cover. \n Carefully pull the needle cover straight off. \n Throw the needle cover away; it is not needed again. \n\nCaution: Do not let the needle touch anything. \n \n \n\n\n\n 72\n\n8. Insert needle \n \n\n \n \n\n Push the needle through the centre of vial stopper, as shown. \n Support the syringe while the needle is in the vial stopper to prevent bending the needle. \n\n \n \n9. Add liquid \n \n\n \n \n\n Tilt both the vial and syringe at an angle, as shown. \n Push the plunger rod down slowly until all the liquid has emptied into the vial. \n Caution: Do not squirt the liquid directly onto the powder, as this creates foam. Foam \n\nmakes the medicine unusable. \n Do not withdraw the needle yet. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n 73\n\n10. Swirl vial \n \n\n \n \n\n Support both the syringe and vial in one hand, as shown. \n Gently swirl the liquid, sliding the vial in a circular motion on a flat surface. \n Continue swirling the liquid until all the powder has fully dissolved. \n\nNote: This may take up to 5 minutes. \n \n \n11. Check medicine \n \n\n \n \n\n Keeping the needle in the vial, look carefully at the medicine. It must be clear and free of \nparticles. \n\n Do not use if: \no the medicine is cloudy or hazy; \no the medicine has any colour at all; \no there are any particles or there is a layer of foam in the vial. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n 74\n\n12. Reposition needle \n \n\n \n \n\n Turn the vial so that you can see the stopper gap, as shown. \n Pull the needle down so that the needle tip is at the lowest point in the liquid. This will \n\nhelp you to draw off as much liquid as possible. \n Check that the plunger rod has not moved—if it has, then push it back all the way into the \n\nsyringe. This ensures that all air is removed from the syringe before you draw off the \ndose. \n\n \n \n13. Draw off dose \n \n\n \n \n\n Slowly pull back the plunger rod to withdraw as much medicine as possible from the vial. \nNote: If you see air in the syringe, tap the barrel to float the bubbles to the top,and then \ngently push the bubbles out into the vial. \n\n Pull the needle out of the vial. \n \n \n\n\n\n 75\n\n14. Insert needle \n \n\n \n \n\n Gently pinch the skin at the site of injection.  \n Insert the needle to its full depth into the pinched skin. \n\n \n \n15. Inject medicine \n \n\n \n \n\n Push the plunger rod down slowly until the barrel is empty. \nNote: Make sure you keep the needle in at full depth. \n\n Release the pinched skin and pull the needle straight out. \n \n \n\n\n\n 76\n\n16. Make needle safe \n \n\n \n \n\n Fold the needle guard over the needle. \n Gently apply pressure using a hard surface to lock the needle guard in place. \n\nNote: You will hear a click when the needle guard has been locked. \n \n \n17. Dispose \n \n\n \n \n\n The syringe and needle should NEVER be reused. Dispose of the needle and syringe as \ninstructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist and in accordance with local health and \nsafety laws. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n 77\n\n18. After injection \n \n\n \n \n\n If necessary, use a clean cotton ball and press lightly on the injection area. \n Do not rub the area. \n\n \n \nQUESTIONS & ANSWERS \n \nWhat should I do if anything has accidentally touched the vial stopper? \n\n Clean the vial stopper with a fresh alcohol wipe, and leave it to dry completely. If you are \nunable to clean the stopper, do not use the vial. \n\n \nWhat should I do with the syringe if it has been dropped? \n\n Do not use it—even if it looks undamaged. Dispose of the syringe in the same way as a \nused syringe. You will need a replacement syringe. \n\n \nHow many times can I safely insert the needle into the vial stopper? \n\n Once only. Withdrawing and reinserting greatly increases the risk of needle damage, and \nwill blunt the needle. This can cause discomfort and increases risk of skin damage and \ninfection. There is also a risk you may lose some of the medicine. \n\n \nIs it OK to shake the vial if the powder is not dissolving? \n\n No—never shake the vial. Shaking can destroy the medicine and create foam. The \npowder may take a few minutes to dissolve fully, so continue swirling the vial gently \nuntil the liquid is completely clear. \n\n \nHow can I tell if there is any foam in the vial? \n\n• Foam looks like a mass of small bubbles that float as a layer to the top of the liquid. Do \nnot inject SOMAVERT if it has foamed. \n\n \n\n\n\n 78\n\n \n \nHow can I prevent the medicine from foaming? \n\n Press the plunger very slowly so that the liquid gently runs down the inside of the vial. \nDo not spray the liquid directly onto the powder, as this creates foam. This technique will \nalso reduce the swirling time and allow more of the medicine to be drawn off. \n\n \nI can see some air in the syringe. Is this OK? \n\n Tiny air bubbles in the liquid are normal and are safe to inject. However, it is possible to \naccidently draw air into the syringe, which should be removed before injecting. Bubbles \nor air gaps that float to the top of the liquid should be pushed back out into the vial. \n\n \nWhy can’t I get all of the medicine out of the vial? \n\n The shape of the vial means that a very small amount of the medicine will be left behind \nin the vial. This is normal. To ensure that only a trace of medicine remains, make sure the \nneedle tip is as low as it can be in the vial when drawing off your dose. \n\n \nWhat should I do if I have any doubts about my medicine? \n\n All questions should be handled by a doctor, nurse or pharmacist familiar with \nSOMAVERT. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
