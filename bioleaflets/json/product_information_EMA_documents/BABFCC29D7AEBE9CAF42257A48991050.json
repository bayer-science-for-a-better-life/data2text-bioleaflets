This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZinbryta 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nZinbryta 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 150 mg of daclizumab beta in 1 mL solution for injection. \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains a pre-filled syringe, containing 150 mg of daclizumab beta in  \n1 mL solution for injection. \n \nDaclizumab beta is produced in a mammalian cell line (NS0) by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection).  \n \nColourless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent liquid with pH 6. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZinbryta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis \n(RMS) who have had an inadequate response to at least two disease modifying therapies (DMTs) and \nfor whom treatment with any other DMT is contraindicated or otherwise unsuitable (see section 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of multiple sclerosis. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Zinbryta is 150 mg injected subcutaneously once a month. \n \nIn case a dose is missed and it is within 2 weeks of the missed dose, patients should be instructed to \ninject without delay their missed dose and then remain on their original monthly dosing schedule.   \n \nIf a dose is missed and it is more than 2 weeks from the missed dose, patients should skip the missed \ndose, wait until their next scheduled dose, and then remain on their original monthly dosing schedule.   \n \nOnly one dose should be administered at a time to make up for a missed dose.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nThere was limited exposure in patients over 55 years of age in clinical studies with daclizumab beta. It \nhas not been determined whether these patients respond differently compared with younger patients.  \n \nRenal impairment \nDaclizumab beta has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. As renal excretion is not a \nmajor route of elimination, no dose adjustments are considered necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nDaclizumab beta has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Zinbryta is contraindicated \nin patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Zinbryta in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nZinbryta is for subcutaneous use. \n \nIt is recommended that patients should be trained in the proper technique for self-administering \nsubcutaneous injection using the pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen. The usual sites for subcutaneous \ninjection include the thigh, abdomen, and back of the upper arm. \n \nZinbryta is provided with the needle pre-attached. Pre-filled syringes/Pre-filled pens contain a single \ndose only and should be discarded after use.   \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nOnce removed from the refrigerator, Zinbryta should be allowed to warm to room temperature \n(20°C-30°C) (about 30 minutes) prior to injection. External heat sources such as hot water must not be \nused to warm Zinbryta. \n \nThis medicinal product should not be used if: \n• the syringe/pen is cracked or broken \n• the solution is cloudy or you can see particles floating in it \n• the solution is any other colour than colourless to slightly yellow \n• the pen has been dropped or is visibly damaged. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nZinbryta is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylaxis or \nanaphylactoid reactions) to all forms of daclizumab or to any of the excipients in Zinbryta (see section \n6.1). \n \nPre-existing hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHepatic injury \nDue to the risk of hepatic injury, the use of Zinbryta is restricted (see section 4.1). \nSerious hepatic injury including elevations of serum transaminases and fatal cases of autoimmune \nhepatitis and fulminant liver failure have occurred in patients treated with Zinbryta (see section 4.8). \nCases occurred early after treatment initiation, in patients having received repeated treatment courses \nand several months after discontinuation. \n \nPrior to treatment initiation with Zinbryta, serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin \nlevels should be obtained, and patients should be screened  for Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV). \nTreatment initiation is not recommended in patients with ALT or AST ≥ 2 times the upper limit of \nnormal (ULN) and is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment (see section \n4.3). For patients who test positive for HBV or HCV infection, consultation with a physician with \nexpertise in the treatment of HBV or HCV is recommended. Treatment initiation is not recommended \nin patients with history of concurrent autoimmune conditions other than multiple sclerosis. \n \nPatient serum transaminase and total bilirubin levels should be monitored at least monthly and as close \nas possible before each administration, and more frequently as clinically indicated during treatment \nand up to 6 months after the last dose of Zinbryta. Treatment discontinuation is recommended in \npatients who reach ALT or AST >3 times the ULN regardless of bilirubin levels.  \n \nPatients should be informed about the risk of hepatic injury, the need for periodic monitoring and \nwarned about signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. If a patient develops clinical signs \nor symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g. unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, \nfatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), it is recommended to promptly measure serum \ntransaminases, discontinue treatment with Zinbryta, as appropriate, and promptly refer the patient to a \nhepatologist.  \n \nTreatment discontinuation should be considered if an adequate response has not been achieved or the \npatient fails to follow the requirement for scheduled liver test monitoring. \n \nCaution should be exercised when administering medicinal products of known hepatotoxic potential, \nincluding non-prescription products and herbal supplements, concomitantly with Zinbryta (see section \n4.5). \n \nRefer to section below, ‘Educational Guidance’, for details of the Hepatic Risk Management Guide for \nPhysicians and Patient Card that are recommended for use with this medicine. \n \nEducational guidance \nAll physicians who intend to prescribe Zinbryta must ensure they are familiar with the Hepatic Risk \nManagement Guide for Physicians for this medicinal product.  \n \nThe physician should discuss the risk of hepatic injury with patients and provide them with a Patient \nCard.  \n \nThe Card informs patients of the risk of serious hepatic injury, and its possible symptoms, so that they \nare aware of situations in which they should contact a healthcare professional in a timely manner. In \naddition, the Card explains the need for monitoring of liver function and educates the patient on the \nimportance of adherence to their monthly blood tests. \n \nSkin reactions \nSkin reactions, some serious (e.g. exfoliative rash or dermatitis, toxic skin eruption), have been \nreported with Zinbryta. Skin reactions generally resolved with standard care, including treatment with \ntopical or systemic steroids. If a patient develops a diffuse or highly inflammatory rash, referral to a \ndermatologist and discontinuation of Zinbryta may be required (see section 4.8). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nDepression \nZinbryta should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders. \nPatients treated with Zinbryta should be advised to report any symptoms of new or worsening \ndepression, and/or suicidal ideation immediately to the prescribing physician. If a patient develops \nsevere depression, and/or suicidal ideation, discontinuation of Zinbryta should be considered (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nInfections  \nInfections, some serious (e.g. pneumonia and bronchitis), have been reported with Zinbryta. If serious \ninfection develops, it could be necessary to withhold treatment with Zinbryta until the infection \nresolves.  \n \nTuberculosis infections have been reported in patients treated with Zinbryta. In patients who have had \ntuberculosis or who live in endemic areas of the disease, screening for active tuberculosis should be \nperformed before starting treatment, and patients should be monitored during treatment. \n \nIn patients with severe active infection, a delay in initiation of Zinbryta therapy should be considered \n(see section 4.8). \n \nZinbryta has not been studied in patients with immunodeficiency syndromes. \n \nAutoimmune haemolytic anaemia  \nAutoimmune haemolytic anaemia has been reported in patients treated with Zinbryta which resolved \nwith standard treatment and discontinuation of Zinbryta.  \nIf a patient develops signs or symptoms of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (e.g. pallor, fatigue, dark \nurine, jaundice, shortness of breath), consider referring to a specialist and discontinuing Zinbryta (see \nsection 4.8).  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nColitis has been reported with Zinbryta. The colitis improved with discontinuation of Zinbryta and \nstandard treatment. Referring patients who develop symptoms of colitis (e.g. abdominal pain, fever, \nprolonged diarrhoea) to a specialist is advisable (see section 4.8).    \n \nLymphopenia \nWhen observed during Zinbryta clinical studies, lymphopenia was mostly mild to moderate \n(≥ 500/mm3). Sustained severe lymphopenia (< 500/mm3), was not observed in clinical studies with \nZinbryta.  However, as a precaution, monitoring of complete blood count is recommended every \n3 months. \n \nThe risk of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) associated to the treatment with \nZinbryta has not been established. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nThis medicinal product contains 0.14 mmol sodium per dose. It is essentially ‘sodium-free’ and can be \nused by patients on a sodium-restricted diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nZinbryta is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination. There is \nlimited data on concomitant use of Zinbryta with MS symptomatic therapies.  \n \nHepatic injury \nCases of hepatic injury have occurred in patients taking Zinbryta with other hepatotoxic drugs, \nalthough the role of these medicinal products is uncertain. Caution is recommended when \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nadministering medicinal products of known hepatotoxic potential including non-prescription products \nand herbal supplements concomitantly with Zinbryta (see section 4.4).  \n\n \nImmunisations \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during treatment with Zinbryta has not been \nstudied. Vaccination with live vaccines is not advised during treatment and up to 4 months after \ndiscontinuation. \n \nIn a clinical study, patients (n=90) on long-term treatment with Zinbryta mounted appropriate immune \nresponses to an inactivated trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. The magnitude of the immune \nresponse to the seasonal influenza vaccine, and proportion of patients with seroconversion and \nseroprotection were consistent with those observed in healthy volunteer populations. Patients on \nZinbryta may receive non-live vaccines. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited data from the use of Zinbryta in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to reprotoxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nZinbryta should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nAvailable toxicology data in lactating cynomolgus monkeys have shown excretion of daclizumab beta \nin milk (for details see section 5.3). It is not known whether Zinbryta is secreted in human milk. \nAlthough human IgG is secreted into human milk, published data suggest that antibodies in breast \nmilk do not enter the neonatal and infant circulations in substantial amounts. A risk to \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nIf a woman wishes to breast-feed during treatment with Zinbryta, the benefit of breast-feeding to the \nchild and of therapy to the woman should be considered. \n \nFertility \nNo impact on male or female fertility as assessed by fertility indices was detected in animal studies \n(see section 5.3). There are no data on the effects of Zinbryta on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZinbryta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn the placebo-controlled study (the SELECT study), 417 patients received Zinbryta (150 mg, n=208; \n300 mg, n=209; every 4 weeks) for up to 1 year. In the active-controlled study (the DECIDE study), \n919 patients received Zinbryta (150 mg, every 4 weeks) and 922 patients received interferon beta-1a \nintramuscular, (30 microgram weekly) for a minimum of 2 years and up to 3 years.  \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in patients treated with \nZinbryta were hepatic reactions, including elevations of serum transaminases (5%), and cutaneous \nreactions (4%) (see section 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported for Zinbryta were rash, increased alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), depression, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, \noropharyngeal pain, and lymphadenopathy.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions are presented as MedDRA preferred terms under the MedDRA System Order \nClass by frequency and incidence.

The \nmost common types of infections were upper respiratory tract infections and viral infections.  The \nmedian duration was similar between the treatment groups. The rate of infections and serious \ninfections did not increase over time. The majority of patients with infections continued on treatment \nwith Zinbryta. Discontinuation of Zinbryta due to infections was <1%. \n \nAutoimmune haemolytic anaemia  \nAutoimmune haemolytic anaemia was reported in < 1% of patients treated with Zinbryta in clinical \nstudies.  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nAn increased incidence of serious colitis (<1%) was reported in patients treated with Zinbryta in \nclinical studies.  \n \nLymphadenopathy \nIn clinical studies, Zinbryta increased the incidence of lymphadenopathy, with onset occurring \nthroughout the treatment period. Discontinuation due to lymphadenopathy was <1% in \nZinbryta-treated patients. The majority of patients with lymphadenopathy continued on treatment with \nZinbryta, and the majority of cases resolved within 3 months. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn the DECIDE study (see section 5.1), patients were tested for anti-drug (daclizumab beta) antibodies \nat week 4 and approximately every 3 months thereafter. Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and \nneutralising antibodies were observed in 19% (175/913) and 8% (71/913) of study patients, \nrespectively. The majority of the treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies responses were transient \n(12% [110/913]) and the remaining minority (7% [65/913]) were persistent. Among the evaluable \npatients, the majority of treatment-emergent neutralising antibody responses were transient (6% [56 of \n913]) and 2% of patients (15 of 913) had persistent responses. Treatment-emergent anti-drug \nantibodies and neutralising antibodies responses predominantly occurred during the first year of \ntreatment and their frequency declined with continued Zinbryta treatment.  \n \nIn patients with neutralising antibodies, daclizumab beta clearance was increased on average by 19% \n(see section 5.2). There was no apparent correlation of anti-drug antibodies or neutralising antibodies \ndevelopment to clinical response, adverse reactions, or pharmacodynamic profile of daclizumab beta. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReported experience with overdose is limited. The safety of doses above 300 mg administered \nsubcutaneously and 400 mg intravenously have not been evaluated. Doses up to this level were well \ntolerated with no evidence of acute toxicity. Potential adverse reactions beyond this level are expected \nto be consistent with the safety profile for daclizumab beta in MS patients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n \nManagement \nIn case of overdose, patients may require medical attention and appropriate supportive treatment \nshould be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC01 \n \nMechanism of action \n\nDaclizumab beta is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to CD25 (IL-2Rα), and \nprevents IL-2 binding to CD25. Daclizumab beta modulates IL-2 signalling by blocking CD25-\ndependent, high-affinity IL-2 receptor signalling, resulting in higher levels of IL-2 available for \nsignalling through the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor.  Key effects of this IL-2 pathway \nmodulation potentially related to the therapeutic effects of daclizumab beta in MS include selective \nantagonism of activated T-cell responses, and expansion of immunoregulatory CD56bright natural killer \n(NK) cells, which have been shown to selectively decrease activated T-cells. Together, these \nimmunomodulatory effects of daclizumab beta are believed to reduce CNS pathology in MS and \nthereby reduce the occurrence of relapses and disability progression. \n\n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn clinical studies, the pharmacodynamic effects of Zinbryta 150 mg administered subcutaneously \nevery 4 weeks were consistent with modulation of IL-2 signalling as evidenced by the rapid and \nsustained saturation of the target CD25 receptors on circulating T-cells and a sustained approximately \n2-fold increase in serum IL-2 concentration. In addition, an increase in CD56bright NK cells and a \ndecrease in regulatory T-cells (defined as CD4+CD127lowFoxP3+ T-cells) was observed within 2 weeks \nafter the first dose, with a sustained 5-fold increase in CD56bright NK cells above baseline and an \napproximately 60% decrease in regulatory T-cells in the treatment phase, with a return to baseline \nlevels approximately 20-24 weeks after the last dose. During Zinbryta treatment, mean cell counts for \nthe major immune subsets (T, B, and NK cells) remained within normal ranges; total lymphocyte, T \nand B cell counts decreased on average ≤10% from baseline during the first year of treatment. Total \nlymphocyte counts returned to baseline levels approximately 8-12 weeks after the last dose of Zinbryta \n(150mg). Total lymphocyte counts <0.8x109 cells/L ([Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \nEvents – CTCAE] Grade 2; at least one measurement) occurred in 4% of placebo-treated and 5% of \nZinbryta-treated patients in the SELECT study, and 9% of the interferon beta-1a \n(intramuscular)-treated and 8% of Zinbryta-treated patients in the DECIDE study. Total NK cell \ncounts increased approximately 1.5-fold as a result of the change in CD56bright NK cells. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe efficacy of Zinbryta was demonstrated in two studies (SELECT and DECIDE) in patients with \nRMS. The SELECT study was double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, with either Zinbryta \n150 mg (n=208), or 300 mg (n=209) versus placebo (n=204) every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The \nDECIDE study was double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled with Zinbryta 150 mg \nevery 4 weeks (n=919) versus interferon beta-1a (intramuscular) 30 micrograms weekly (n=922), for a \nminimum of 2 to a maximum of 3 years (96 to 144 weeks).

The absolute bioavailability of daclizumab beta 150 mg \nsubcutaneously administered was approximately 90% based on a cross-study population \npharmacokinetic analysis of subcutaneous and intravenous dosing. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of daclizumab beta 150 mg every 4 weeks, steady-state serum \ndaclizumab beta concentrations were achieved by the 4th dose and daclizumab beta accumulated to a \nlevel approximately 2.5-fold compared to a single dose. At steady state, daclizumab beta mean \nmaximum serum concentration (Cmax), minimum serum concentration (Cmin) and area under the serum \nconcentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUCtau) values were approximately \n30 micrograms/mL, 15 micrograms/mL and 640  day*micrograms/mL, respectively, with inter-patient \nvariability (% CV) of approximately 40%. \n \nBased on the cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis, the steady-state volume of distribution \nof daclizumab beta is 6.34 L in a patient with a body weight of 68 kg (approximate median of \nevaluated patients). This small volume of distribution indicates that daclizumab beta is primarily \nconfined to the vascular and interstitial spaces. \n \nBiotransformation \nThe exact metabolic pathway for daclizumab beta has not been characterised. As an IgG1 monoclonal \nantibody, daclizumab beta is expected to undergo catabolism to peptides and amino acids in the same \nmanner as endogenous IgG. Daclizumab beta is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic \nenzymes such as CYP isoenzymes (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \nAs an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, daclizumab beta is not expected to undergo renal elimination. \n \nBased on the cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis, the clearance of daclizumab beta is \n0.212 L/day with a terminal half-life value of approximately 21 days. Daclizumab beta clearance in \npatients who developed neutralising antibodies was, on average, 19% higher (see section 4.8 \nImmunogenicity). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nConsistent with results from individual studies, a cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis \nindicated that daclizumab beta exposure is more than dose-proportional in the 50 mg to 100 mg \nsubcutaneous dose range and is dose proportional in the 100 mg to 300 mg subcutaneous dose range. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \nWithin the studied regimens of daclizumab beta 150 mg and 300 mg administered subcutaneous every \n4 weeks in MS patients, there was no clear relationship between daclizumab beta exposure and clinical \nefficacy endpoints (ARR, T2 lesions and Gd-enhancing lesions) or safety endpoints of interest (serious \ninfection status, moderate or severe cutaneous adverse reaction, and AST/ALT > 5 times the ULN). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo studies were conducted to evaluate daclizumab beta pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or \nhepatic impairment. Daclizumab beta is not expected to undergo renal elimination or metabolism by \nhepatic enzymes (see section 4.2). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nWeight \nBased on the cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis, body weight accounted for less than \n40% of the inter-patient variability in daclizumab beta clearance. No meaningful differences in clinical \nefficacy or safety were observed among the subgroups of MS patients by weight quartile in the \nDECIDE study. \n \nAge and gender \nBased on the cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis, daclizumab beta pharmacokinetics \nwere not influenced by age (range: 18 to 66 years; n=1670) or gender (n = 567 males and \n1103 females). \n \nRace \nNo pharmacokinetic differences were observed between Japanese and Caucasian healthy volunteers. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical safety studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys due to species specificity of \ndaclizumab beta binding only to human or primate CD25. \n \nCarcinogenesis \nCarcinogenicity studies with daclizumab beta have not been conducted.  In two 9 month studies in \nmonkeys there were no pre-neoplastic or neoplastic tissue observed. \n \nMutagenesis \nGenotoxicity studies have not been conducted. \n \nReproductive toxicity \nDaclizumab beta did not affect reproductive capacity in female and male cynomolgus monkeys (AUC \nin females and males up to 85 and 100 times higher than the exposure at the clinical dose respectively). \nThere was no effect on foetal development and no evidence of teratogenicity. Daclizumab beta had no \neffect on peri- and post-natal development from birth to up to 6 months in the offspring. Exposures \n(AUC) in these studies ranged from 55 to 140 times that observed with the clinical \ndose.  Daclizumab beta was detected in the milk of 11/14 lactating monkeys at levels that were \n<0.122% of the maternal serum levels, with no adverse reactions observed in the off-spring.  \n \nToxicology \nIn two 9 month studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys daclizumab beta was subcutaneously \nadministered at bi-weekly doses of 10-200 mg/kg. \nChronic administration of daclizumab beta at all doses increased the incidence of skin findings \n(compared to those observed in control animals). These findings (dry, red raised patchy areas of the \nskin, as compared to controls, that correlated microscopically with acanthosis/hyperkeratosis and sub-\nacute to chronic inflammation) were characterised predominantly as mild to moderate, with one case \nassessed as severe. \n \nA dose dependent increase in incidence of microglial aggregates above background was observed in \nthe brain and spinal cord of monkeys treated with ≥35 mg/kg, (AUC 27 times higher than the clinical \ndose). Following a recovery period of up to 12 weeks, there was evidence of reversibility. Microglial \naggregates in monkeys did not increase in incidence or severity with increased duration of dosing and \nwere not associated with neuronal damage or neurobehavioral effects. A small subset of microglial \naggregates were associated with microhaemorrhage but with no evident functional sequelae in \nmonkeys. \n \nIn vitro investigative studies suggest that microglial aggregates are not due to a direct effect of \ndaclizumab beta on microglial cells but are likely to be attributable to an increase in local IL-2 \nbioavailability. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nThe clinical relevance of microglial aggregates is unknown, however no deleterious neurologic effects \nattributed to the microscopic change have been observed in monkeys. \n \n \n6.

This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Zinbryta is and what it is used for  \n2.

Instructions for injecting Zinbryta \n \n \n1. What Zinbryta is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance in Zinbryta is daclizumab beta. This is a type of medicine called a monoclonal \nantibody. \n \nWhat Zinbryta is used for \nZinbryta is used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults who have failed to \nrespond despite therapy with at least two MS treatment and who cannot be given other treatments. \n\nIn MS, the body’s immune system causes inflammation which damages the protective sheath (called \nmyelin) around the nerves in the central nervous system (including the brain and spinal cord). This \nloss of myelin is called demyelination. This stops nerves from working properly. \n\nPeople with relapsing MS have repeated attacks (relapses) of symptoms caused by their nerves not \nworking properly. These symptoms vary from patient to patient but usually involve problems such as \ndifficulty with walking, vision and balance. \n\nSymptoms may disappear completely after the relapse is over but, over time, some problems may \nremain between relapses and interfere with daily activities. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38 \n\nHow Zinbryta works \nZinbryta works by stopping the body’s immune system from damaging your brain and spinal \ncord. This can help to reduce the number of relapses that you have and slow down the disabling \neffects of MS. Treatment with Zinbryta can help to prevent you from getting worse, although it will \nnot cure MS. Your doctor will decide whether Zinbryta is the right medicine for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Zinbryta \n \nDo not use Zinbryta \n- if you have previously had a serious allergic reaction to any form of daclizumab, or any of the \n\nother ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6. \n- if you have liver problems.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Zinbryta: \n-  if you have any other autoimmune disorders in addition to MS \n- if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines and herbal \n\nsupplements.  Your doctor will evaluate if any medicines or supplements you are taking have \nliver side effects and whether you should continue these medicines while taking Zinbryta \n\n- if you have depression or have had it in the past. \n-  if you have a serious infection, such as pneumonia. \n- if you have ever had tuberculosis (also called TB) or live in a region where TB infections are \n\ncommon, you may be at greater risk of TB. You may be tested for TB before starting Zinbryta \nand monitored during treatment. \n\n \n\nPossible liver problems \n\nZinbryta may cause serious liver problems that may be life-threatening or result in death.  Serious liver \nproblems can occur both early after starting treatment with Zinbryta, any time during treatment and \nseveral months after discontinuing treatment. Even if you have had no previous liver problems, your \ndoctor will carry out blood tests to test your liver function. You will need: \n-  a blood test before starting treatment to check your liver function and if you have hepatitis B \n\nand C. If your blood test shows that you have some liver problems, your doctor will decide \nwhether to start Zinbryta \n\n-  at least monthly blood tests during treatment, as close as possible before each dose of \nZinbryta, and more often if your doctor decides this is necessary \n\n-  tests for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. Side effects may occur even after stopping \ntreatment (see serious side effects in section 4). \n\n \n\nIt is very important that you have these regular blood tests. If you do not not undergo your \nscheduled blood tests your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Zinbryta. \n\nYou will be given a Patient Card with further information about the things to watch out for while \ntaking Zinbryta. Keep this Card with you during treatment and for 6 months afterwards. When you \nhave any medical treatment, even if it is not for your MS, show the Patient Card to the doctor, \npharmacist or nurse. \n\nIf you experience any of the following, contact your doctor immediately: \n\n• unexplained nausea (feeling sick) \n• vomiting (being sick) \n• stomach pain \n• increased tiredness \n• loss of appetite \n• your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\n• dark (tea-coloured) urine   \n \nThese symptoms may suggest problems with your liver. If you do develop liver problems your MS \ndoctor may stop your treatment with Zinbryta and refer you to a liver specialist (see section 4, Possible \nside effects). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nZinbryta is not to be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years old. The safety and \neffectiveness of Zinbryta in this age group are not known. \n \nElderly \nZinbryta has had very little testing in people older than 55 years old. If you are over 55 your doctor \nmay still prescribe Zinbryta. \n \nOther medicines and Zinbryta \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines  and herbal \nsupplements. Your doctor will evaluate if any medicines or supplements you are taking have liver side \neffects and whether you should continue these medicines while receiving Zinbryta. \n \nVaccinations \nIf you need a vaccination, ask your doctor first because Zinbryta may affect how well vaccines work. \nSeasonal flu vaccines (inactive vaccine) have been shown to be effective when given to patients taking \nZinbryta. However, Zinbryta’s effect on other vaccines (live vaccines) is not known. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAs data on use of Zinbryta during pregnancy are limited, the risk to the baby and benefit to the mother \nshould be taken into consideration. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or \nare planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nIt is not known whether Zinbryta passes into breast milk. Your doctor will help you decide whether \nyou should stop breast-feeding, or stop using Zinbryta.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nZinbryta is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines. Your doctor will tell you \nwhether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. \n \nZinbryta contains a small amount of sodium \nEach dose of Zinbryta contains 0.14 mmol sodium. It is essentially ‘sodium-free’ and can be used by \npeople on a sodium-restricted diet. \n \n \n3. How to use Zinbryta \n \nZinbryta will be prescribed to you by a doctor experienced in the treatment of MS. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nRecommended dose \nThe dose of Zinbryta is 150 mg every month. \nTry to do your injection on the same day each month, to help you remember it. For example, inject on \nthe first day of each month.  \n \nYou will also have a blood test to check your liver every month, as close as possible before each dose \nof Zinbryta, and more often if your doctor decides this is necessary. It is very important that you do \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nnot miss this blood test. Try to keep to a set day for it each month. Contact your doctor if you think \nyou may have missed a blood test.  \n \nInjecting yourself  \nZinbryta is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) into your thigh, stomach or back of your upper \narm. Detailed instructions for injecting Zinbryta are given in section 7, Instructions for injecting \nZinbryta. \n \nYour doctor or nurse should train you to give yourself the injections. Read and follow the advice given \nin section 7. \n \nIf you have trouble handling the syringe/pen, tell your doctor or nurse who may be able to help. \n \nHow long to use Zinbryta \nYour doctor will tell you how long you need to keep using Zinbryta. Do not make changes unless your \ndoctor tells you to. \n \nIf your doctor has told you to stop using your medicine, do not restart unless your doctor tells you to. \nIf your MS does not respond to Zinbryta, your doctor may decide to stop your treatment with Zinbryta. \n \nIf you use more Zinbryta than you should \nIf you have injected more than your usual dose, and you notice any side effects, or are concerned, \nspeak with your doctor or nurse. Patients have received double the recommended dose of Zinbryta \nwith no serious extra side effects. \n \nIf you forget to take Zinbryta \nZinbryta is injected monthly. Try to keep to a particular day of the month to help remember your \ninjection. \n \n• If you do forget a dose, and it is within 2 weeks of your missed dose, inject as soon as you can. \n\nThen carry on as normal, sticking to your usual injection day. \n• However, if it is more than 2 weeks from your missed dose, skip the missed dose and take your \n\nnext dose on your usual day.  \n \nIn either case, do not use two injections to make up for a missed dose. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Do not try \nto treat any side effects yourself, but contact your doctor or nurse. Some side effects may require \nyour doctor to interrupt your treatment and refer you to a specialist. \n \nSerious side effects:  \n\nLiver problems:  \n\n(Common - may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• unexplained nausea (feeling sick) \n• vomiting (being sick) \n• stomach pain \n• increased tiredness \n• loss of appetite (anorexia) \n• your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow \n• dark (tea-coloured) urine   \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\n(Uncommon – may affect up to  1 in 100 people) \n• Severe inflammation of the liver which might be life-threatening or result in death  \n \nContact your doctor immediately.

No risk factors or alternative aetiology have been reported in any of these cases. There \nis also a plausible mechanism of action for the development of sarcoidosis due to the \nimmunomodulatory effects of daclizumab beta and involvement of daclizumab beta in the origin of \nother immune-mediated events. The causal relationship between daclizumab beta and sarcoidosis is \nconsidered possible. \n \nColitis \n \nFour new serious cases of colitis confirmed by health-care professionals have been received during \nthis period. Cumulatively, 24 cases of colitis have been retrieved from clinical trials. There is a \nplausible mechanism of action for the development of this colitis due to immunomodulatory properties \nof daclizumab beta and involvement of daclizumab beta in the origin of other immune-mediated \nevents. The causal relationship between daclizumab beta and colitis is possible. \nSection 4.8 of the SmPC has been reviewed to add the adverse reaction sarcoidosis with a frequency \nuncommon and the adverse reaction colitis with a frequency common.  \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for daclizumab beta the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing daclizumab beta is unchanged subject to \nthe proposed changes to the product information \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
