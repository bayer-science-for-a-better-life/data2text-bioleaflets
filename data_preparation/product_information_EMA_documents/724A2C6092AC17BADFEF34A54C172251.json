NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTopotecan Teva 1 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \nTopotecan Teva 4 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nTopotecan Teva 1 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n1 ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 1 mg topotecan (as hydrochloride). \n \nTopotecan Teva 4 mg/4 ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n1 ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 1 mg topotecan (as hydrochloride). \nOne vial of 4 ml of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 4 mg topotecan (as hydrochloride). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear pale yellow liquid. pH = 2.0-2.6. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTopotecan monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of: \n patients with metastatic carcinoma of the ovary after failure of first line or subsequent therapy. \n patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the \n\nfirst-line regimen is not considered appropriate (see section 5.1).  \n \nTopotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix \nrecurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior \nexposure to cisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the \ncombination (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of topotecan should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and should only be administered under the supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the use of chemotherapy (see section 6.6).  \n \nPosology \n \nWhen topotecan is used in combination with cisplatin, the full prescribing information for \ncisplatin should be consulted.  \n \nPrior to administration of the first course of topotecan, patients must have a baseline neutrophil \ncount of ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, a platelet count of ≥ 100 x 109/l and a haemoglobin level of ≥ 9 g/dl (after \ntransfusion if necessary).  \n \nOvarian and small cell lung carcinoma \nInitial dose \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 1.5 mg/m2 body surface area per day administered by \nintravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for five consecutive days with a three week interval \nbetween the start of each course. If well tolerated, treatment may continue until disease progression \n(see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  \n \nSubsequent doses \nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is ≥ 1 x 109/l, the platelet \ncount is ≥ 100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is ≥ 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary).  \n \nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan \nwith other medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to reduce the dose to maintain neutrophil counts. \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count \n< 0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection, \nor who have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by \n0.25 mg/m2/day to 1.25 mg/m2/day (or subsequently down to 1.0 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l. In clinical studies, \ntopotecan was discontinued if the dose had been reduced to 1.0 mg/m2/day and a further dose \nreduction was required to manage adverse effects.  \n \nCervical carcinoma \nInitial dose \nThe recommended dose of topotecan is 0.75 mg/m2/day administered as a 30-minute \nintravenous infusion on days 1, 2 and 3. Cisplatin is administered as an intravenous infusion on \nday 1 at a dose of 50 mg/m2/day and following the topotecan dose. This treatment schedule is \nrepeated every 21 days for six courses or until progressive disease.  \n \nSubsequent doses \nTopotecan should not be re-administered unless the neutrophil count is ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, the platelet \ncount is ≥100 x 109/l, and the haemoglobin level is ≥ 9 g/dl (after transfusion if necessary).  \n \nStandard oncology practice for the management of neutropenia is either to administer topotecan \nwith other medicinal products (e.g. G-CSF) or to reduce the dose to maintain neutrophil counts.   \n \nIf dose reduction is chosen for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count \n< 0.5 x 109/l) for seven days or more, or severe neutropenia associated with fever or infection or \nwho have had treatment delayed due to neutropenia, the dose should be reduced by 20% to \n0.60 mg/m2/day for subsequent courses (or subsequently down to 0.45 mg/m2/day if necessary). \n \nDoses should be similarly reduced if the platelet count falls below 25 x 109/l.  \n \nSpecial populations \nPatients with renal impairment \nMonotherapy (ovarian and small cell lung carcinoma) \nThere is insufficient experience with the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired \nrenal function (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min). Use of topotecan in this group of patients is \nnot recommended (see section 4.4). \nLimited data indicate that the dose should be reduced in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment. The recommended monotherapy dose of topotecan in patients with ovarian or small \ncell lung carcinoma and a creatinine clearance between 20 and 39 ml/min is 0.75 mg/m2/day for \nfive consecutive days.  \n \nCombination therapy (cervical carcinoma) \nIn clinical studies with topotecan in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of cervical \ncancer, therapy was only initiated in patients with serum creatinine less than or equal to \n1.5 mg/dl. If, during topotecan/cisplatin combination therapy serum creatinine exceeds \n\n\n\n4 \n\n1.5 mg/dl, it is recommended that the full prescribing information be consulted for any advice \non cisplatin dose reduction/continuation. If cisplatin is discontinued, there are insufficient data \nregarding continuing monotherapy with topotecan in patients with cervical cancer.  \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nA small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) were \ngiven intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2/day for five days every three weeks. A reduction in \ntopotecan clearance was observed. However, there are insufficient data available to make a dose \nrecommendation for this patient group (see section 4.4). \n \nThere is insufficient experience with the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired hepatic \nfunction (serum bilirubin ≥ 10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Topotecan is not recommended to be used in \nthis patient group (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nCurrently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology \ncan be made. \n \n \nMethod of administration \n \n \nTopotecan must be further diluted before use (see section 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n- Severe bone marrow depression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by baseline \n\nneutrophils < 1.5 x 109/l and/or a platelet count of < 100 x 109/l.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaematological toxicity is dose-related and full blood count including platelets should be determined \nregularly (see section 4.2). \n \nAs with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression. \nMyelosuppression leading to sepsis and fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients \ntreated with topotecan (see section 4.8). \n \nTopotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic \ncolitis have been reported in clinical studies with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, \nneutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic colitis \nshould be considered.  \n \nTopotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which \nhave been fatal (see section 4.8). Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary \nfibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation and use of pneumotoxic substances and/or \ncolony stimulating factors. Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of \nILD (e.g. cough, fever, dyspnoea and/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be discontinued if a \nnew diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. \n \nTopotecan monotherapy and topotecan in combination with cisplatin are commonly associated \nwith clinically relevant thrombocytopenia. This should be taken into account when prescribing \nTopotecan Teva, e.g. if patients at increased risk of tumour bleeds are considered for therapy.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nAs would be expected, patients with poor performance status (PS>1) have a lower response rate \nand an increased incidence of complications such as fever, infection and sepsis (see section 4.8). \nAccurate assessment of performance status at the time therapy is given is important, to ensure \nthat patients have not deteriorated to PS 3.  \n \nThere is insufficient experience of the use of topotecan in patients with severely impaired renal \nfunction (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) or severely impaired hepatic function (serum \nbilirubin ≥ 10 mg/dl) due to cirrhosis. Use of topotecan in these patient groups is not \nrecommended (see section 4.2). \n \nA small number of hepatically impaired patients (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and 10 mg/dl) \nwere given intravenous topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2/day for five days every three weeks. A reduction \nin topotecan clearance was observed.  However there are insufficient data available to make a \ndose recommendation for this patient group (see section 4.2).  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo in vivo human pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been performed.  \n \nTopotecan does not inhibit human P450 enzymes (see section 5.2). In a population study using \nthe intravenous route, the co-administration of granisetron, ondansetron, morphine or \ncorticosteroids did not appear to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of total \ntopotecan (active and inactive form). \n \nWhen combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each \nmedicinal product may be required to improve tolerability. However, when combining with \nplatinum agents, there is a distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the \nplatinum agent is given on day 1 or 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is \ngiven on day 1 of the topotecan dosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve \ntolerability compared to the dose of each agent which can be given if the platinum agent is \ngiven on day 5 of the topotecan dosing.  \n \nWhen topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m2/day on day 1) \nwere administered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC (12%, n = 9) and \nCmax (23%, n = 11) was noted on day 5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical \nrelevance.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n \nTopotecan has been shown to cause embryo-foetal lethality and malformations in preclinical \nstudies (see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan may cause \nfoetal harm and therefore women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming \npregnant during therapy with topotecan.  \n \nAs with all cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients being treated with topotecan must be advised that \nthey or their partner must use an effective method of contraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIf topotecan is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy with \ntopotecan, the patient must be warned of the potential hazards to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTopotecan is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3).  Although it is not known \nwhether topotecan is excreted in human breast milk, breast-feeding should be discontinued at \nthe start of therapy.  \n \nFertility \n \nNo effects on male or female fertility have been observed in reproductive toxicity studies in rats \n(see section 5.3). However as with other cytotoxic medicinal products topotecan is genotoxic \nand effects on fertility, including male fertility, cannot be excluded. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nHowever, caution should be observed when driving or operating machines if fatigue and \nasthenia persist.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn dose-finding studies involving 523 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer and 631 patients \nwith relapsed small cell lung cancer, the dose limiting toxicity of topotecan monotherapy was \nfound to be haematological. Toxicity was predictable and reversible. There were no signs of \ncumulative haematological or non- haematological toxicity.  \n \nThe safety profile of topotecan when given in combination with cisplatin in the cervical cancer \nclinical studies is consistent with that seen with topotecan monotherapy. The overall \nhaematological toxicity is lower in patients treated with topotecan in combination with cisplatin \ncompared to topotecan monotherapy, but higher than with cisplatin alone.  \n \nAdditional adverse events were seen when topotecan was given in combination with cisplatin, \nhowever, these events were seen with cisplatin monotherapy and were not attributable to \ntopotecan. The prescribing information for cisplatin should be consulted for a full list of adverse \nevents associated with cisplatin use.  \n \nThe integrated safety data for topotecan monotherapy are presented below.  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and absolute frequency (all reported \nevents). Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nInfections and infestations \nVery common Infection \nCommon Sepsis1 \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common Febrile neutropenia, neutropenia (see “Gastrointestinal disorders”), \n\nthrombocytopenia, anaemia, leucopenia \nCommon Pancytopenia \nNot known Severe bleeding (associated with thrombocytopenia) \nImmune system disorders \nCommon Hypersensitivity reaction including rash \nRare Anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, urticaria \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common Anorexia (which may be severe) \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nRare Interstitial lung disease (some cases have been fatal) \n\n\n\n7 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (all of which may be severe), constipation, \n\nabdominal pain2, mucositis \nNot known Gastrointestinal perforation \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon Hyperbilirubinaemia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common Alopecia \nCommon Pruritus \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common Pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue \nCommon Malaise \nVery rare Extravasation3 \nNot known Mucosal inflammation \n1 Fatalities due to sepsis have been reported in patients treated with topotecan (see section 4.4). \n2 Neutropenic colitis, including fatal neutropenic colitis, has been reported to occur as a complication \nof topotecan-induced neutropenia (see section 4.4). \n3 Reactions have been mild and have not generally required specific therapy. \n \nThe adverse events listed above have the potential to occur with a higher frequency in patients \nwho have a poor performance status (see section 4.4). \n \nThe frequencies associated with the haematological and non-haematological adverse events \nlisted below represent the adverse event reports considered to be related/possibly related to \ntopotecan therapy.  \n \nHaematological \n \nNeutropenia \nSevere (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 109/l) during course 1 in 55 % of patients, with duration \n≥ seven days in 20 % and overall in 77 % of patients (39 % of courses). In association with \nsevere neutropenia, fever or infection occurred in 16 % of patients during course 1 and overall \nin 23 % of patients (6 % of courses). Median time to onset of severe neutropenia was nine days \nand the median duration was seven days. Severe neutropenia lasted beyond seven days in 11 % \nof courses overall. Among all patients treated in clinical studies (including both those with \nsevere neutropenia and those who did not develop severe neutropenia), 11 % (4 % of courses) \ndeveloped fever and 26 % (9 % of courses) developed infection. In addition, 5 % of all patients \ntreated (1 % of courses) developed sepsis (see section 4.4).  \n \nThrombocytopenia \nSevere (platelets < 25 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (8 % of courses); moderate (platelets between \n25.0 and 50.0 x 109/l) in 25 % of patients (15 % of courses). Median time to onset of severe \nthrombocytopenia was day 15 and the median duration was five days. Platelet transfusions were \ngiven in 4 % of courses. Reports of significant sequelae associated with thrombocytopenia \nincluding fatalities due to tumour bleeds have been infrequent.  \n \nAnaemia \nModerate to severe (Hb ≤ 8.0 g/dl) in 37 % of patients (14 % of courses). Red cell transfusions \nwere given in 52 % of patients (21 % of courses).  \n \nNon-haematological \n \nFrequently reported non-haematological effects were gastrointestinal, such as nausea (52 %), \nvomiting (32 %), diarrhoea (18 %), constipation (9 %) and mucositis (14 %). The incidence of \nsevere (Grade 3 or 4) nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and mucositis was 4, 3, 2 and 1 % \nrespectively.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nMild abdominal pain was reported in 4 % of patients.  \n \nFatigue was observed in approximately 25 % and asthenia in 16 % of patients receiving \ntopotecan. Severe (Grade 3 or 4) fatigue and asthenia both occurred with an incidence of 3 %.  \n \nTotal or pronounced alopecia was observed in 30 % of patients and partial alopecia in 15 % of \npatients.  \n \nOther severe events that were recorded as related or possibly related to topotecan treatment were \nanorexia (12 %), malaise (3 %) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1 %).  \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been \nreported rarely. In clinical studies, rash was reported in 4 % of patients and pruritus in 1.5 % of \npatients.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdoses have been reported in patients being treated with intravenous topotecan (up to 10 fold of \nthe recommended dose) and topotecan capsules (up to 5 fold of the recommended dose). The signs and \nsymptoms observed following overdose were consistent with the known undesirable events associated \nwith topotecan (see section 4.8). The primary complications of overdose are bone marrow suppression \nand mucositis. In addition, elevated hepatic enzymes have been reported with intravenous topotecan \noverdose. \n \nThere is no known antidote for topotecan overdose. Further management should be as clinically \nindicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX17. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe anti-tumour activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of topoisomerase-I, an enzyme \nintimately involved in DNA replication as it relieves the torsional strain introduced ahead of the \nmoving replication fork. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase-I by stabilising the covalent complex \nof enzyme and strand-cleaved DNA which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The \ncellular sequela of inhibition of topoisomerase-I by topotecan is the induction of protein-\nassociated DNA single-strand breaks.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRelapsed ovarian cancer \nIn a comparative study of topotecan and paclitaxel in patients previously treated for ovarian \ncarcinoma with platinum based chemotherapy (n = 112 and 114, respectively), the response rate \n(95 % CI) was 20.5 % (13 %, 28 %) versus 14 % (8 %, 20 %) and median time to progression \n19 weeks versus 15 weeks (hazard ratio 0.7 [0.6, 1.0]),  for topotecan and paclitaxel, \n\n\n\n9 \n\nrespectively. Median overall survival was 62 weeks for topotecan versus 53 weeks for paclitaxel \n(hazard ratio 0.9 [0.6, 1.3]).  \n \nThe response rate in the whole ovarian carcinoma programme (n = 392, all previously treated \nwith cisplatin or cisplatin and paclitaxel) was 16 %. The median time to response in clinical \nstudies was 7.6-11.6 weeks. In patients refractory to, or relapsing within 3 months after cisplatin \ntherapy (n = 186), the response rate was 10%.  \n \nThese data should be evaluated in the context of the overall safety profile of the medicinal \nproduct, in particular of the significant haematological toxicity (see section 4.8).  \n \nA supplementary retrospective analysis was conducted on data from 523 patients with relapsed \novarian cancer. Overall, 87 complete and partial responses were observed, with 13 of these \noccurring during cycles 5 and 6 and 3 occurring thereafter. Of the patients who received more \nthan 6 cycles of therapy, 91 % completed the study as planned or were treated until disease \nprogression with only 3 % withdrawn for adverse events.  \n \nRelapsed SCLC \nA Phase III study (Study 478) compared oral topotecan plus best supportive care (BSC) (n=71) with \nBSC alone (n=70) in patients who had relapsed following first line therapy (median time to \nprogression [TTP] from first-line therapy: 84 days for oral topotecan plus BSC, 90 days for BSC \nalone) and for whom re-treatment with intravenous chemotherapy was not considered appropriate. In \nthe oral topotecan plus BSC group there was a statistically significant improvement in overall survival \ncompared with the BSC alone group (Log- rank p = 0.0104). The unadjusted hazard ratio for the oral \ntopotecan plus BSC group relative to the BSC alone group was 0.64 (95 % CI: 0.45, 0.90). Median \nsurvival in patients treated with oral topotecan plus BSC was 25.9 weeks (95 % CI 18.3, 31.6) \ncompared to 13.9 weeks (95 % CI 11.1, 18.6) for patients receiving BSC alone (p = 0.0104). \n \nPatient self-reports of symptoms using an unblinded assessment showed a consistent trend for \nsymptom benefit for oral topotecan plus BSC. \n \nOne Phase II study (Study 065) and one Phase III study (Study 396) were conducted to evaluate the \nefficacy of oral topotecan versus intravenous topotecan in patients who had relapsed ≥ 90 days after \ncompletion of one prior regimen of chemotherapy (see Table 1). Oral and intravenous topotecan were \nassociated with similar symptom palliation in patients with relapsed sensitive SCLC in patient self \nreports on an unblinded symptom scale assessment in each of these two studies. \n \nTable 1.

Median time to progression was similar in the two  groups (13.3 weeks and 12.3 weeks \nrespectively). Median survivals for the two groups were 25.0 and 24.7 weeks respectively. The \nhazard ratio for survival with IV topotecan relative to CAV was 1.04 (95 %   CI 0.78 – 1.40).  \n \nThe response rate to topotecan in the combined small cell lung cancer programme (n=480) for \npatients with relapsed disease sensitive to first-line therapy, was 20.2 %. Median survival was \n30.3 weeks (95 % CI: 27.6, 33.4). \n \nIn a population of patients with refractory SCLC (those not responding to first line therapy), the \nresponse rate to topotecan was 4.0 %.  \n \nCervical carcinoma \nIn a randomised, comparative Phase III study conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group \n(GOG 0179), topotecan plus cisplatin (n = 147) was compared with cisplatin alone (n = 146) for \nthe treatment of histologically confirmed persistent, recurrent or Stage IVB carcinoma of the \ncervix where curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation was not considered appropriate. \nTopotecan plus cisplatin had a statistically significant benefit in overall survival relative to \ncisplatin monotherapy after adjusting for interim analyses (Log-rank p = 0.033). \n \n \n\nStudy results Study GOG-0179 \n \n\nITT population \n Cisplatin \n\n50 mg/m2 on \nday 1, every \n\n21 days \n\nCisplatin \n50 mg/m2 on day 1 + \n\nTopotecan  \n0.75 mg/m2 on \ndays 1–3, every \n\n21 days \nSurvival (months) (n = 146) (n = 147) \nMedian (95% CI) 6.5 (5.8, 8.8) 9.4 (7.9, 11.9) \nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.76 (0.59, 0.98) \nLog rank p-value 0.033 \n  \n\nPatients without prior cisplatin chemoradiotherapy \n Cisplatin Topotecan/Cisplatin \n\nSurvival (months) (n = 46) (n = 44) \nMedian (95% CI) 8.8 (6.4, 11.5) 15.7 (11.9, 17.7) \nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.51 (0.31, 0.82) \n  \n\nPatients with prior cisplatin chemoradiotherapy \n Cisplatin Topotecan/Cisplatin \n\nSurvival (months) (n = 72) (n = 69) \nMedian (95% CI) 5.9 (4.7, 8.8) 7.9 (5.5, 10.9) \nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.85 (0.59, 1.21) \n\n \nIn patients (n = 39) with recurrence within 180 days after chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin, the \nmedian survival in the topotecan plus cisplatin arm was 4.6 months (95 % CI: 2,6, 6.1) versus \n4.5 months (95 % CI: 2.9, 9.6) for the cisplatin arm with a hazard ratio of 1.15 (0.59, 2.23). In those \n\n\n\n11 \n\npatients (n = 102) with recurrence after 180 days, median survival in the topotecan plus cisplatin arm \nwas 9.9 months (95 % CI: 7, 12.6) versus 6.3 months (95 % CI: 4.9, 9.5) for the cisplatin arm with a \nhazard ratio of 0.75 (0.49, 1.16).  \n \nPaediatric population \nTopotecan was also evaluated in the paediatric population; however, only limited data on \nefficacy and safety are available.  \n \nIn an open-label study involving children (n = 108, age range: infant to 16 years) with recurrent \nor progressive solid tumours, topotecan, was administered at a starting dose of 2.0 mg/m2 given \nas a 30- minute infusion for 5 days repeated every 3 weeks for up to one year depending on \nresponse to therapy. Tumour types included were Ewing’s sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal \ntumour, neuroblastoma, osteoblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Anti-tumour activity was \ndemonstrated primarily in patients with neuroblastoma. Toxicities of topotecan in paediatric \npatients with recurrent and refractory solid tumours were similar to those historically seen in \nadult patients. In this study, forty-six (43 %) patients received G-CSF over 192 (42.1 %) \ncourses; sixty-five (60 %) received transfusions of packed red blood cells and fifty (46 %) of \nplatelets over 139 and 159 courses (30.5 % and 34.9 %), respectively. Based on the dose-\nlimiting toxicity of myelosuppression, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at \n2.0 mg/m2/day with G-CSF and 1.4 mg/m2/day without G-CSF in a pharmacokinetic study in \npaediatric patients with refractory solid tumours (see section 5.2).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of topotecan at doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/m2 as a 30 minute \ninfusion daily for five days, topotecan demonstrated a high plasma clearance of 62 l/h (SD 22), \ncorresponding to approximately 2/3 of liver blood flow. Topotecan also had a high volume of \ndistribution, about 132 1 (SD 57), and a relatively short half-life of 2-3 hours. Comparison of \npharmacokinetic parameters did not suggest any change in pharmacokinetics over the 5 days of  \ndosing. Area under the curve increased approximately in proportion to the increase in dose. \nThere is little or no accumulation of topotecan with repeated daily dosing and there is no \nevidence of a change in the pharmacokinetics after multiple doses. Preclinical studies indicate \nplasma protein binding of topotecan is low (35 %) and distribution between blood cells and \nplasma was fairly homogeneous. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe elimination of topotecan has only been partly investigated in man. A major route of \nclearance of topotecan was by hydrolysis of the lactone ring to form the ring-opened \ncarboxylate.  \n \nMetabolism accounts for <10 % of the elimination of topotecan. An N-desmethyl metabolite, \nwhich was shown to have similar or less activity than the parent in a cell-based assay, was \nfound in urine, plasma, and faeces. The mean metabolite: parent AUC ratio was < 10% for both \ntotal topotecan and topotecan lactone. An O-glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N-\ndesmethyl topotecan has been identified in the urine.  \n \nElimination \n \nOverall recovery of topotecan-related material following five daily doses of topotecan was 71 to \n76 % of the administered IV dose. Approximately 51 % was excreted as total topotecan and 3% \nwas excreted as N-desmethyl topotecan in the urine. Faecal elimination of total topotecan \naccounted for 18% while faecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.7 %. Overall, the \nN-desmethyl metabolite contributed a mean of less than 7% (range 4-9%) of the total topotecan-\n\n\n\n12 \n\nrelated material accounted for in the urine and faeces. The topotecan-O-glucuronide and \nN-desmethyl topotecan-O-glucuronide in the urine were less than 2.0%.  \n \nIn vitro data using human liver microsomes indicate the formation of small amounts of \nN-demethylated topotecan. In vitro, topotecan did not inhibit human P450 enzymes CYP1A2, \nCYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A or CYP4A, nor did it inhibit the \nhuman cytosolic enzymes dihydropyrimidine or xanthine oxidase.  \n \nWhen given in combination with cisplatin (cisplatin day 1, topotecan days 1 to 5), the clearance \nof topotecan was reduced on day 5 compared to day 1 (19.1 l/h/m2 compared to \n21.3 l/h/m2 [n = 9]) (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nPlasma clearance in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin between 1.5 and \n10 mg/dl) decreased to about 67 % when compared with a control group of patients. Topotecan \nhalf-life was increased by about 30% but no clear change in volume of distribution was \nobserved. Plasma clearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form) in patients with hepatic \nimpairment only decreased by about 10 % compared with the control group of patients.  \n \nRenal impairment \nPlasma clearance in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 41-60 ml/min.) \ndecreased to about 67 % compared with control patients. Volume of distribution was slightly \ndecreased and thus half-life only increased by 14 %. In patients with moderate renal impairment \ntopotecan plasma clearance was reduced to 34 % of the value in control patients. Mean half-life \nincreased from 1.9 hours to 4.9 hours.  \n \nAge/weight \nIn a population study, a number of factors including age, weight and ascites had no significant \neffect on clearance of total topotecan (active and inactive form).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of topotecan given as a 30-minute infusion for 5 days were evaluated in \ntwo studies. One study included a dose range of 1.4 to 2.4 mg/m2 in children (aged 2 up to 12 \nyears, n = 18), adolescents (aged 12 up to 16 years, n = 9) and young adults (aged 16 to 21 \nyears, n = 9) with refractory solid tumours. The second study included a dose range of 2.0 to \n5.2 mg/m2 in children (n = 8), adolescents (n = 3) and young adults (n = 3) with leukaemia. In \nthese studies, there were no apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan among \nchildren, adolescents, and young adult patients with solid tumours or leukaemia, but data are too \nlimited to draw definite conclusions.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nResulting from its mechanism of action, topotecan is genotoxic to mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma \ncells and human lymphocytes) in vitro and mouse bone marrow cells in vivo. Topotecan was also \nshown to cause embryo-foetal lethality when given to rats and rabbits.  \n \nIn reproductive toxicity studies with topotecan in rats there was no effect on male or female fertility; \nhowever, in females super-ovulation and slightly increased pre-implantation loss were observed. \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of topotecan has not been studied.  \n \n \n6.
