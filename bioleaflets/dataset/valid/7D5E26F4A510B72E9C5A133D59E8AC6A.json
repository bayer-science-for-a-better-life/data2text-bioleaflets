NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nBonviva 150 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg ibandronic acid (as sodium monohydrate). \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect:  \n\nContains 154.6 mg anhydrous lactose (equivalent to 162.75 mg lactose monohydrate).  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\nWhite to off white film-coated tablets, of oblong shape marked \u201cBNVA\u201d on one side, and \u201c150\u201d on \n\nthe other side.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture (see section 5.1). \n\nA reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral neck fractures \n\nhas not been established. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose is one 150 mg film-coated tablet once a month. The tablet should preferably \n\nbe taken on the same date each month. \n\n \n\nBonviva should be taken after an overnight fast (at least 6 hours) and 1 hour before the first food or \n\ndrink (other than water) of the day (see section 4.5) or any other oral medicinal products or \n\nsupplementation (including calcium). \n\n \n\nIn case a dose is missed, patients should be instructed to take one Bonviva 150 mg tablet the morning \n\nafter the tablet is remembered, unless the time to the next scheduled dose is within 7 days.  \n\nPatients should then return to taking their dose once a month on their originally scheduled date. \n\nIf the next scheduled dose is within 7 days, patients should wait until their next dose and then continue \n\ntaking one tablet once a month as originally scheduled.  \n\nPatients should not take two tablets within the same week. \n\n \n\nPatients should receive supplemental calcium and / or vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate (see \n\nsection 4.4 and section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis has not been established. The need \n\nfor continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically based on the benefits and potential risks of \n\nBonviva on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nBonviva is not recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min due to limited \n\nclinical experience (see section 4.4 and section 5.2). \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment where creatinine \n\nclearance is equal or greater than 30 ml/min. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly population (>65 years) \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Bonviva in children below 18 years, and Bonviva was not studied in this \n\npopulation. (see section 5.1 and section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor oral use. \n\n \n\n- Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water (180 to 240 ml) while the patient is \n\nsitting or standing in an upright position. Water with a high concentration of calcium should not \n\nbe used. If there is a concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard \n\nwater), it is advised to use bottled water with a low mineral content. \n\n- Patients should not lie down for 1 hour after taking Bonviva. \n\n- Water is the only drink that should be taken with Bonviva.  \n\n- Patients should not chew or suck the tablet, because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\n- Hypocalcaemia  \n\n- Abnormalities of the oesophagus which delay oesophageal emptying such as stricture or \n\nachalasia \n\n- Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes     \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHypocalcaemia \n\nExisting hypocalcaemia must be corrected before starting Bonviva therapy. Other disturbances of bone \n\nand mineral metabolism should also be effectively treated. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D \n\nis important in all patients. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal irritation \n\nOrally administered bisphosphonates may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. \n\nBecause of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, \n\ncaution should be used when Bonviva is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems \n\n(e.g. known Barrett\u2019s oesophagus, dysphagia, other oesophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or \n\nulcers). \n\nAdverse reactions such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, in some cases \n\nsevere and requiring hospitalisation, rarely with bleeding or followed by oesophageal stricture or \n\nperforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. The risk of \n\nsevere oesophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who do not comply with the \n\ndosing instruction and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms \n\nsuggestive of oesophageal irritation. Patients should pay particular attention to and be able to comply \n\nwith the dosing instructions (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPhysicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible oesophageal reaction and \n\npatients should be instructed to discontinue Bonviva and seek medical attention if they develop \n\ndysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. \n\nWhile no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials there have been post-marketing \n\nreports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with \n\ncomplications. \n\n \n\nSince Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products and bisphosphonates are both associated \n\nwith gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant administration. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported very rarely in the post marketing setting in patients \n\nreceiving Bonviva for osteoporosis (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \n\nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth. \n\n \n\nA dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is \n\nrecommended prior to treatment with Bonviva in patients with concomitant risk factors. \n\n \n\nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient\u2019s risk of developing ONJ:  \n\n- Potency of the medicinal product that inhibit bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent \n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative \n\ndose of bone resorption therapy \n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking \n\n- Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to \n\nhead and neck \n\n- Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, invasive \n\ndental procedures e.g. tooth extractions \n\n \n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \n\nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \n\nsores or discharge during treatment with Bonviva. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures \n\nshould be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to Bonviva \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nThe management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration \n\nbetween the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary \n\ninterruption of Bonviva treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing \n\nrisk factors are mitigated where possible. \n\n  \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \n\nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \n\ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \n\npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \n\nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n\n \n\nAtypical fractures of the femur \n\nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \n\ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \n\noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \n\nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \n\nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \n\nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \n\ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \n\n\n\n5 \n\nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \n\nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \n\npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n\nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \n\nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nDue to limited clinical experience, Bonviva is not recommended for patients with a creatinine \n\nclearance below 30 ml/min (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nGalactose intolerance \n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \n\nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \n\nmedicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nMedicinal product-Food Interaction  \n\nOral bioavailability of ibandronic acid is generally reduced in the presence of food. In particular, \n\nproducts containing calcium, including milk, and other multivalent cations (such as aluminium, \n\nmagnesium, iron), are likely to interfere with absorption of Bonviva, which is consistent with findings \n\nin animal studies. Therefore, patients should fast overnight (at least 6 hours) before taking Bonviva \n\nand continue fasting for 1 hour following intake of Bonviva (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nInteractions with other medicinal products \n\nMetabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major \n\nhuman hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 \n\nsystem in rats (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not \n\nundergo any biotransformation.  \n\n \n\nCalcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products containing multivalent cations \n\nCalcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products containing multivalent cations (such \n\nas aluminium, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with the absorption of Bonviva. Therefore, \n\npatients should not take other oral medicinal products for at least 6 hours before taking Bonviva and \n\nfor 1 hour following intake of Bonviva.  \n\n \n\nAcetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs   \n\nSince Acetylsalicylic acid, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) and \n\nbisphosphonates are associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during \n\nconcomitant administration (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nH2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors  \n\nOf over 1500 patients enrolled in study BM 16549 comparing monthly with daily dosing regimens of \n\nibandronic acid, 14 % and 18 % of patients used histamine (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors \n\nafter one and two years, respectively. Among these patients, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal \n\nevents in the patients treated with Bonviva 150 mg once monthly was similar to that in patients treated \n\nwith ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. \n\n \n\nIn healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, intravenous administration of ranitidine \n\ncaused an increase in ibandronic acid bioavailability of about 20 %, probably as a result of reduced \n\ngastric acidity. However, since this increase is within the normal variability of the bioavailability of \n\nibandronic acid, no dose adjustment is considered necessary when Bonviva is administered with H2-\n\nantagonists or other active substances which increase gastric pH. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \n\nBonviva is only for use in postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women of childbearing \n\npotential. \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of ibandronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in rats have \n\nshown some reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nBonviva should not be used during pregnancy. \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats have \n\ndemonstrated the presence of low levels of ibandronic acid in the milk following intravenous \n\nadministration. \n\nBonviva should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data on the effects of ibandronic acid from humans. In reproductive studies in rats by the \n\noral route, ibandronic acid decreased fertility. In studies in rats using the intravenous route, ibandronic \n\nacid decreased fertility at high daily doses (see section 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\nOn the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and reported adverse reactions, it is \n\nexpected that Bonviva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most serious reported adverse reactions are anaphylactic reaction/shock, atypical fractures of the \n\nfemur, osteonecrosis of the jaw, gastrointestinal irritation, ocular inflammation, (see paragraph \n\n\u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d and section 4.4). \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are arthralgia and influenza-like symptoms. These \n\nsymptoms are typically in association with the first dose, generally of short duration, mild or moderate \n\nin intensity, and usually resolve during continuing treatment without requiring remedial measures (see \n\nparagraph \u201cInfluenza like illness\u201d). \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nIn table 1 a complete list  of known adverse reactions is presented. The safety of oral treatment with \n\nibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily was evaluated in 1251 patients treated in 4 placebo-controlled clinical \n\nstudies, with the large majority of patients coming from the pivotal three year fracture study \n\n(MF4411).  \n\nIn a two-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM 16549) the overall safety of \n\nBonviva 150 mg once monthly and ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily was similar. The overall proportion \n\nof patients who experienced an adverse reaction, was 22.7 % and 25.0 % for Bonviva 150 mg once \n\nmonthly after one and two years, respectively. Most cases did not lead to cessation of therapy. \n\nAdverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. \n\nFrequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (>1/10),  common \n\n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000),very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions occurring in postmenopausal women receiving Bonviva 150 mg once \n\nmonthly or ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in the phase III studies BM16549 and MF4411 and in post-\n\nmarketing experience. \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Asthma \n\nexacerbation \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nreaction  \n\nAnaphylactic \n\nreaction/shock*\u2020 \n\n \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nHeadache Dizziness   \n\nEye disorders   Ocular \n\ninflammation*\u2020 \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders* \n\nOesophagitis, \n\nGastritis, Gastro \n\noesophageal reflux \n\ndisease, Dyspepsia, \n\nDiarrhoea, \n\nAbdominal pain, \n\nNausea \n\nOesophagitis \n\nincluding \n\noesophageal \n\nulcerations or \n\nstrictures and \n\ndysphagia, \n\nVomiting, \n\nFlatulence \n\nDuodenitis  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissues disorders \n\nRash  Angioedema, \n\nFace oedema, \n\nUrticaria \n\nStevens-Johnson \n\nSyndrome\u2020, \n\nErythema \n\nMultiforme\u2020, \n\nDermatitis \n\nBullous\u2020 \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nArthralgia, Myalgia, \n\nMusculoskeletal pain, \n\nMuscle cramp, \n\nMusculoskeletal \n\nstiffness \n\nBack pain Atypical \n\nsubtrochanteric \n\nand diaphyseal \n\nfemoral fractures\u2020  \n\nOsteonecrosis of \n\njaw*\u2020  \n\nOsteonecrosis of \n\nthe external \n\nauditory canal \n\n(bisphosphonate \n\nclass adverse \n\nreaction)\u2020 \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nInfluenza like illness* Fatigue   \n\n*See further information below \n\n\u2020Identified in post-marketing experience. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal adverse reactions \n\nPatients with a previous history of gastrointestinal disease including patients with peptic ulcer without \n\nrecent bleeding or hospitalisation, and patients with dyspepsia or reflux controlled by medication were \n\nincluded in the once monthly treatment study. For these patients, there was no difference in the \n\nincidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events with the 150 mg once monthly regimen compared to \n\nthe 2.5 mg daily regimen. \n\n \n\nInfluenza-like illness \n\nInfluenza-like illness includes events reported as acute phase reaction or symptoms including myalgia, \n\narthralgia, fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, or bone pain. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nOsteonecrosis of jaw \n\nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \n\nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as ibandronic acid (see section 4.4.) Cases of \n\nONJ have been reported in the post marketing setting for ibandronic acid. \n\n \n\nOcular inflammation \n\nOcular inflammation events such as uveitis, episcleritis and scleritis have been reported with \n\nibandronic acid. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the ibandronic acid was discontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reaction/shock \n\nCases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith intravenous ibandronic acid. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Bonviva. \n\nHowever, based on a knowledge of this class of compounds, oral overdose may result in upper \n\ngastrointestinal adverse reactions (such as upset stomach, dyspepsia, oesophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer) \n\nor hypocalcaemia. Milk or antacids should be given to bind Bonviva, and any adverse reactions treated \n\nsymptomatically. Owing to the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the \n\npatient should remain fully upright. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC \n\ncode: M05-BA06 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nIbandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of \n\nbisphosphonates, which act selectively on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity \n\nwithout directly affecting bone formation. It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. Ibandronic \n\nacid leads to progressive net gains in bone mass and a decreased incidence of fractures through the \n\nreduction of elevated bone turnover towards premenopausal levels in postmenopausal women. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nThe pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic \n\nacid prevents experimentally induced bone destruction caused by cessation of gonadal function, \n\nretinoids, tumours or tumour extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is \n\nalso inhibited, leading to increased normal bone mass compared with untreated animals. \n\nAnimal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In \n\ngrowing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralization even at doses greater than 5,000 times \n\nthe dose required for osteoporosis treatment. \n\nBoth daily and intermittent (with prolonged dose-free intervals) long-term administration in rats, dogs \n\nand monkeys was associated with formation of new bone of normal quality and maintained or \n\nincreased mechanical strength even at doses in the toxic range. In humans, the efficacy of both daily \n\nand intermittent administration with a dose-free interval of 9-10 weeks of ibandronic acid was \n\nconfirmed in a clinical trial (MF 4411), in which ibandronic acid demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nIn animal models ibandronic acid produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent \n\ninhibition of bone resorption, including suppression of urinary biochemical markers of bone collagen \n\ndegradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX)). \n\n \n\nIn a Phase 1 bioequivalence study conducted in 72 postmenopausal women receiving 150 mg orally \n\nevery 28 days for a total of four doses, inhibition in serum CTX following the first dose was seen as \n\nearly as 24 hours post-dose (median inhibition 28 %), with median maximal inhibition (69 %) seen \n\n6 days later. Following the third and fourth dose, the median maximum inhibition 6 days post dose \n\nwas 74 % with reduction to a median inhibition of 56 % seen 28 days following the fourth dose. With \n\nno further dosing, there is a loss of suppression of biochemical markers of bone resorption. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nIndependent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fractures, a family \n\nhistory of fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to \n\nidentify women at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. \n\n \n\nBonviva 150 mg once monthly \n\n \n\nBone mineral density (BMD) \n\nBonviva 150 mg once monthly was shown to be at least as effective as ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily at \n\nincreasing BMD in a two year, double-blind, multicentre study (BM 16549) of postmenopausal \n\nwomen with osteoporosis (lumbar spine BMD T score below -2.5 SD at baseline). This was \n\ndemonstrated in both the primary analysis at one year and in the confirmatory analysis at two years \n\nendpoint (Table 2). \n\n \n\nTable 2: Mean relative change from baseline of lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and trochanter \n\nBMD after one year (primary analysis) and two years of treatment (Per-Protocol Population) in study \n\nBM 16549. \n\n \n\n One year data in study BM 16549 Two year data in study \n\nBM 16549 \n\nMean relative changes \n\nfrom baseline % [95% CI]  \n\nibandronic acid \n\n2.5 mg daily \n\n(N=318) \n\nBonviva \n\n150 mg once \n\nmonthly \n\n(N=320) \n\nibandronic acid \n\n2.5 mg daily \n\n(N=294) \n\nBonviva \n\n150 mg once \n\nmonthly \n\n(N=291) \n\nLumbar spine L2-L4 BMD 3.9 [3.4, 4.3]  4.9 [4.4, 5.3]  5.0 [4.4, 5.5]  6.6 [6.0, 7.1]  \n\nTotal hip BMD 2.0 [1.7, 2.3]  3.1 [2.8, 3.4]  2.5 [2.1, 2.9]  4.2 [3.8, 4.5]  \n\nFemoral neck BMD 1.7 [1.3, 2.1]  2.2 [1.9, 2.6]  1.9 [1.4, 2.4]  3.1 [2.7, 3.6]  \n\nTrochanter BMD 3.2 [2.8, 3.7]  4.6 [4.2, 5.1]  4.0 [3.5, 4.5]  6.2 [5.7, 6.7]  \n\n \n\nFurthermore, Bonviva 150 mg once monthly was proven superior to ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily for \n\nincreases in lumbar spine BMD in a prospectively planned analysis at one year, p=0.002, and at two \n\nyears, p<0.001. \n\n \n\nAt one year (primary analysis), 91.3 % (p=0.005) of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly \n\nhad a lumbar spine BMD increase above or equal to baseline (BMD responders), compared with \n\n84.0 % of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. At two years, 93.5 % (p=0.004) and 86.4 % \n\nof patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly or ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily, respectively, \n\nwere responders.  \n\n \n\nFor total hip BMD, 90.0 % (p<0.001) of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly and 76.7 % \n\nof patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily had total hip BMD increases above or equal to \n\nbaseline at one year. At two years  93.4 % (p<0.001) of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once \n\n\n\n10 \n\nmonthly and 78.4 %, of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily had total hip BMD increases \n\nabove or equal to baseline. \n\n \n\nWhen a more stringent criterion is considered, which combines both lumbar spine and total hip BMD, \n\n83.9 % (p<0.001) and 65.7 % of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly or ibandronic acid \n\n2.5 mg daily, respectively, were responders at one year. At two years, 87.1 % (p<0.001) and 70.5 %,of \n\npatients met this criterion in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms respectively. \n\n \n\nBiochemical markers of bone turn-over \n\nClinically meaningful reductions in serum CTX levels were observed at all time points measured, i.e. \n\nmonths 3, 6, 12 and 24. After one year (primary analysis) the median relative change from baseline \n\nwas -76 % for Bonviva 150 mg once monthly and -67 % for ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. At two \n\nyears the median relative change was -68 % and -62 %, in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms \n\nrespectively.  \n\n \n\nAt one year, 83.5 % (p= 0.006) of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly and 73.9 % of \n\npatients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily were identified as responders (defined as a decrease \n\n\u226550 % from baseline). At two years 78.7 % (p=0.002) and 65.6 % of patients were identified as \n\nresponders in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms respectively. \n\n \n\nBased on the results of study BM 16549, Bonviva 150 mg once monthly is expected to be at least as \n\neffective in preventing fractures as ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. \n\n \n\nIbandronic acid 2.5 mg daily \n\n \n\nIn the initial three-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fracture study (MF 4411), a \n\nstatistically significant and medically relevant decrease in the incidence of new radiographic \n\nmorphometric and clinical vertebral fractures was demonstrated (table 3). In this study, ibandronic \n\nacid was evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently as an exploratory regimen. \n\nIbandronic acid was taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink of the day (post-dose fasting \n\nperiod). The study enrolled women aged 55 to 80 years, who were at least 5 years postmenopausal, \n\nwho had a BMD at lumbar spine of 2 to 5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one \n\nvertebra [L1-L4], and who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures. All patients received 500 mg \n\ncalcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily. Efficacy was evaluated in 2,928 patients. ibandronic acid 2.5 mg \n\nadministered daily, showed a statistically significant and medically relevant reduction in the incidence \n\nof new vertebral fractures. This regimen reduced the occurrence of new radiographic vertebral \n\nfractures by 62 % (p=0.0001) over the three year duration of the study. A relative risk reduction of \n\n61 % was observed after 2 years (p=0.0006). No statistically significant difference was attained after 1 \n\nyear of treatment (p=0.056). The anti-fracture effect was consistent over the duration of the study. \n\nThere was no indication of a waning of the effect over time.  \n\nThe incidence of clinical vertebral fractures was also significantly reduced by 49 % (p=0.011). The \n\nstrong effect on vertebral fractures was furthermore reflected by a statistically significant reduction of \n\nheight loss compared to placebo (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 3: Results from 3 years fracture study MF 4411 (%, 95 % CI) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N=974) \n\nibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily \n\n(N=977) \n\nRelative Risk Reduction \n\nNew morphometric vertebral \n\nfractures \n\n62 % (40.9, 75.1) \n\nIncidence of new morphometric \n\nvertebral fractures \n\n9.56 % (7.5, 11.7) 4.68 % (3.2,6.2) \n\nRelative risk reduction of clinical \n\nvertebral fracture \n\n49 %  \n\n(14.03, 69.49) \n\nIncidence of clinical vertebral \n\nfracture \n\n5.33 % \n\n(3.73, 6.92) \n\n2.75 % \n\n(1.61, 3.89) \n\nBMD \u2013 mean change relative to \n\nbaseline lumbar spine at year 3 \n\n1.26 % (0.8, 1.7) 6.54 % (6.1, 7.0) \n\nBMD \u2013 mean change relative to \n\nbaseline total hip at year 3 \n\n-0.69 %\n\n(-1.0, -0.4)\n\n3.36 % \n\n(3.0, 3.7) \n\nThe treatment effect of ibandronic acid was further assessed in an analysis of the subpopulation of \n\npatients who at baseline had a lumbar spine BMD T-score below \u20132.5.

Increases at the hip compared to baseline were 2.8 % at the femoral neck, 3.4 % at the total \n\nhip, and 5.5 % at the trochanter. \n\nBiochemical markers of bone turnover (such as urinary CTX and serum Osteocalcin) showed the \n\nexpected pattern of suppression to premenopausal levels and reached maximum suppression within a \n\nperiod of 3-6 months. \n\nA clinically meaningful reduction of 50 % of biochemical markers of bone resorption was observed as \n\nearly as one month after start of treatment with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg. \n\n\n\n12 \n\nFollowing treatment discontinuation, there is a reversion to the pathological pre-treatment rates of \n\nelevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis. \n\nThe histological analysis of bone biopsies after two and three years of treatment of postmenopausal \n\nwomen showed bone of normal quality and no indication of a mineralization defect. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.2) \n\nBonviva was not studied in the paediatric population, therefore no efficacy or safety data are available \n\nfor this patient population.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe primary pharmacological effects of ibandronic acid on bone are not directly related to actual \n\nplasma concentrations, as demonstrated by various studies in animals and humans.  \n\n \n\nAbsorption  \n\nThe absorption of ibandronic acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration \n\nand plasma concentrations increase in a dose-proportional manner up to 50 mg oral intake, with \n\ngreater than dose-proportional increases seen above this dose. Maximum observed plasma \n\nconcentrations were reached within 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in the fasted state and absolute \n\nbioavailability was about 0.6 %. The extent of absorption is impaired when taken together with food or \n\nbeverages (other than water). Bioavailability is reduced by about 90 % when ibandronic acid is \n\nadministered with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability seen in fasted subjects. \n\nThere is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability provided ibandronic acid is taken 60 minutes \n\nbefore the first food of the day. Both bioavailability and BMD gains are reduced when food or \n\nbeverage is taken less than 60 minutes after ibandronic acid is ingested. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nAfter initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine. In \n\nhumans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 l and the amount of dose reaching \n\nthe bone is estimated to be 40-50 % of the circulating dose. Protein binding in human plasma is \n\napproximately 85 % - 87 % (determined in vitro at therapeutic concentrations), and thus there is a low \n\npotential for interaction with other medicinal products due to displacement. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nThere is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolised in animals or humans. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe absorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is removed from the circulation via bone absorption \n\n(estimated to be 40-50 % in postmenopausal women) and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by \n\nthe kidney. The unabsorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is eliminated unchanged in the faeces. \n\n \n\nThe range of observed apparent half-lives is broad, the apparent terminal half-life is generally in the \n\nrange of 10-72 hours. As the values calculated are largely a function of the duration of study, the dose \n\nused, and assay sensitivity, the true terminal half-life is likely to be substantially longer, in common \n\nwith other bisphosphonates. Early plasma levels fall quickly reaching 10 % of peak values within 3 \n\nand 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration respectively.  \n\nTotal clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range 84-160 ml/min. Renal \n\nclearance (about 60 mL/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50-60 % of total \n\nclearance and is related to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total and renal \n\nclearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone. \n\n \n\nThe secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the \n\nexcretion of other active substances. In addition, ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major human \n\nhepatic P450 isoenzymes and does not induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special clinical situations \n\n \n\nGender \n\nBioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid are similar in men and women. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nThere is no evidence for any clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences between Asians and \n\nCaucasians in ibandronic acid disposition. There are few data available on patients of African origin. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment  \n\nRenal clearance of ibandronic acid in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly \n\nrelated to creatinine clearance. \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr equal or \n\ngreater than 30 ml/min), as shown in study BM 16549 where the majority of patients had mild to \n\nmoderate renal impairment. \n\nSubjects with severe renal failure (CLcr less than 30 ml/min) receiving daily oral administration of \n\n10 mg ibandronic acid for 21 days, had 2-3 fold higher plasma concentrations than subjects with \n\nnormal renal function and total clearance of ibandronic acid was 44 ml/min. After intravenous \n\nadministration of 0.5 mg, total, renal, and non-renal clearances decreased by 67 %, 77 % and 50 %, \n\nrespectively, in subjects with severe renal failure but there was no reduction in tolerability associated \n\nwith the increase in exposure. Due to the limited clinical experience, Bonviva is not recommended in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2 and section 4.4). The pharmacokinetics of \n\nibandronic acid was not assessed in patients with end-stage renal disease managed by other than \n\nhemodialysis. The pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid in these patients is unknown, and ibandronic \n\nacid should not be used under these circumstances. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) \n\nThere are no pharmacokinetic data for ibandronic acid in patients who have hepatic impairment. The \n\nliver has no significant role in the clearance of ibandronic acid which is not metabolised but is cleared \n\nby renal excretion and by uptake into bone. Therefore dose adjustment is not necessary in patients \n\nwith hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nElderly population (see section 4.2) \n\nIn a multivariate analysis, age was not found to be an independent factor of any of the \n\npharmacokinetic parameters studied. As renal function decreases with age this is the only factor to \n\ntake into consideration (see renal impairment section). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.1) \n\nThere are no data on the use of Bonviva in these age groups. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nToxic effects, e.g signs of renal damage, were observed in dogs only at exposures considered \n\nsufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.  \n\n \n\nMutagenicity/Carcinogenicity: \n\nNo indication of carcinogenic potential was observed. Tests for genotoxicity revealed no evidence of \n\ngenetic activity for ibandronic acid. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity: \n\nThere was no evidence for a direct foetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid in orally treated \n\nrats and rabbits and there were no adverse effects on the development in F1 offspring in rats at an \n\nextrapolated exposure of at least 35 times above human exposure. In reproductive studies in rats by the \n\noral route effects on fertility consisted of increased preimplantation losses at dose levels of 1 \n\nmg/kg/day and higher. In reproductive studies in rats by the intravenous route, ibandronic acid \n\ndecreased sperm counts at doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day and decreased fertility in males at 1 \n\nmg/kg/day and in females at 1.2 mg/kg/day. Adverse effects of ibandronic acid in reproductive \n\n\n\n14 \n\ntoxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class. They include a \n\ndecreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase \n\nin visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection. \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture (see section 5.1). \n\nA reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral neck fractures \n\nhas not been established. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nPatients treated with Bonviva should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of ibandronic acid is 3 mg, administered as an intravenous injection over 15 -\n\n 30 seconds, every three months. \n\nPatients must receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.4 and section 4.5), \n\nIf a dose is missed, the injection should be administered as soon as convenient. Thereafter, injections \n\nshould be scheduled every 3 months from the date of the last injection. \n\nThe optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis has not been established. The need \n\nfor continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically based on the benefits and potential risks of \n\nBonviva on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nBonviva injection is not recommended for use in patients who have a serum creatinine above \n\n200 \u03bcmol/l (2.3 mg/dl) or who have a creatinine clearance (measured or estimated) below 30 ml/min, \n\nbecause of limited clinical data available from studies including such patients (see section 4.4 and \n\nsection 5.2). \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment where serum \n\ncreatinine is equal or below 200 \u03bcmol/l (2.3 mg/dl) or where creatinine clearance (measured or \n\nestimated) is equal or greater than 30 ml/min. \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nElderly population (>65 years) \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Bonviva in children below 18 years, and Bonviva was not studied in this \n\npopulation  (see section 5.1 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor intravenous use over 15 - 30 seconds, every three months. \n\n \n\nStrict adherence to the intravenous administration route is required (see section 4.4). \n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\n- Hypocalcaemia \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nAdministration failures \n\nCare must be taken not to administer Bonviva injection via intra-arterial or paravenous administration \n\nas this could lead to tissue damage. \n\n \n\nHypocalcaemia \n\nBonviva, like other bisphosphonates administered intravenously, may cause a transient decrease in \n\nserum calcium values. \n\nExisting hypocalcaemia must be corrected before starting Bonviva injection therapy. Other \n\ndisturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should also be effectively treated before starting \n\nBonviva injection therapy.  \n\n \n\nAll patients must receive adequate supplemental calcium and vitamin D. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reaction/shock \n\nCases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith intravenous ibandronic acid. \n\nAppropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available when Bonviva \n\nintravenous injection is administered. If anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions \n\noccur, immediately discontinue the injection and initiate appropriate treatment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nPatients with concomitant diseases, or who use medicinal products which have potential for \n\nundesirable effects on the kidney, should be reviewed regularly in line with good medical practice \n\nduring treatment.  \n\n \n\nDue to limited clinical experience, Bonviva injection is not recommended for patients with a serum \n\ncreatinine above 200 \u03bcmol/l (2.3 mg/dl) or with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min (see section \n\n4.2 and section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nPatients with cardiac impairment \n\nOverhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported very rarely in the post marketing setting in patients \n\nreceiving Bonviva for osteoporosis (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \n\nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth. \n\nA dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is \n\nrecommended prior to treatment with Bonviva in patients with concomitant risk factors. \n\nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient\u2019s risk of developing ONJ: \n\n- Potency of the medicinal product that inhibit bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent\n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative\n\ndose of bone resorption therapy\n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking\n\n- Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to\n\nhead and neck\n\n- Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease,\n\ninvasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions\n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \n\nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \n\nsores or discharge during treatment with Bonviva. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures \n\nshould be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to Bonviva \n\nadministration. \n\nThe management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration \n\nbetween the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary \n\ninterruption of Bonviva treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing \n\nrisk factors are mitigated where possible. \n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \n\nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \n\ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \n\npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \n\nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n\nAtypical fractures of the femur \n\nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \n\ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \n\noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \n\nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \n\nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \n\nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \n\ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \n\nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \n\nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \n\npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n\nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \n\nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n\nBonviva is essentially sodium free. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\nMetabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major \n\nhuman hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 \n\nsystem in rats (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not \n\nundergo any biotransformation.  \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nBonviva is only for use in postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women of child bearing \n\npotential. \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of ibandronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in rats have \n\nshown some reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nBonviva should not be used during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats have \n\ndemonstrated the presence of low levels of ibandronic acid in the milk following intravenous \n\nadministration. Bonviva should not be used during  breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no data on the effects of ibandronic acid from humans. In reproductive studies in rats by the \n\noral route, ibandronic acid decreased fertility. In studies in rats using the intravenous route, ibandronic \n\nacid decreased fertility at high daily doses (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nOn the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and reported adverse reactions, it is \n\nexpected that Bonviva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most serious reported adverse reactions are anaphylactic reaction/shock, atypical fractures of the \n\nfemur, osteonecrosis for the jaw and ocular inflammation (see paragraph \u201cDescription of selected \n\nadverse reactions\u201d and section 4.4). \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are arthralgia and influenza-like symptoms. These \n\nsymptoms are typically in association with the first dose, generally of short duration, mild or moderate \n\nin intensity, and usually resolve during continuing treatment without requiring remedial measures \n\n(please see paragraph \u201cInfluenza like illness\u201d). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nIn table 1 a complete list of known adverse reactions is presented.  \n\nThe safety of oral treatment with ibandronic acid  2.5 mg  daily was evaluated in 1251 patients treated \n\nin 4 placebo-controlled clinical studies, with the large majority of patients coming from the pivotal \n\nthree-year fracture  study (MF 4411).  \n\n \n\nIn the pivotal two-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM16550), the overall \n\nsafety of intravenous injection of Bonviva 3 mg every 3 months and oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily \n\nwere shown to be similar. The overall proportion of patients who experienced an adverse reaction was \n\n26.0 % and 28.6 % for Bonviva 3 mg injection every 3 months after one year and two years, \n\nrespectively.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC \n\ncode: M05BA06 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nIbandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of \n\nbisphosphonates, which act selectively on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity \n\nwithout directly affecting bone formation. It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. Ibandronic \n\nacid leads to progressive net gains in bone mass and a decreased incidence of fractures through the \n\nreduction of elevated bone turnover towards premenopausal levels in postmenopausal women. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nThe pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic \n\nacid prevents bone destruction experimentally induced by cessation of gonadal function, retinoids, \n\ntumours or tumour extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is also \n\ninhibited, leading to increased normal bone mass compared with untreated animals. \n\n \n\nAnimal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In \n\ngrowing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralisation even at doses greater than 5,000 times \n\nthe dose required for osteoporosis treatment. \n\n \n\nBoth daily and intermittent (with prolonged dose-free intervals) long-term administration in rats, dogs \n\nand monkeys was associated with formation of new bone of normal quality and maintained or \n\nincreased mechanical strength even at doses in the toxic range. In humans, the efficacy of both daily \n\nand intermittent administration with a dose-free interval of 9 - 10 weeks of ibandronic acid was \n\nconfirmed in a clinical trial (MF 4411), in which ibandronic acid demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy. \n\n \n\nIn animal models ibandronic acid produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent \n\ninhibition of bone resorption, including suppression of urinary biochemical markers of bone collagen \n\ndegradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX)). \n\n \n\nBoth daily, intermittent (with a dose-free interval of 9 - 10 weeks per quarter) oral doses as well as \n\nintravenous doses of ibandronic acid in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes \n\nindicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nBonviva intravenous injection decreased levels of serum C-telopeptide of the alpha chain of Type I \n\ncollagen (CTX) within 3 - 7 days of starting treatment and decreased levels of osteocalcin within \n\n3 months. \n\n \n\nFollowing treatment discontinuation, there is a reversion to the pathological pre-treatment rates of \n\nelevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis. \n\n \n\nThe histological analysis of bone biopsies after two and three years of treatment of postmenopausal \n\nwomen with doses of oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily and intermittent intravenous doses of up to \n\n1 mg every 3 months showed bone of normal quality and no indication of a mineralisation defect. An \n\nexpected decrease in bone turnover, normal quality of bone and absence of defects in mineralization \n\nwere also seen after two years of treatment with Bonviva 3 mg injection. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nIndependent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fractures, a family \n\nhistory of fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to \n\nidentify women at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. \n\n \n\nBonviva 3 mg injection every 3 months \n\n \n\nBone mineral density (BMD) \n\nBonviva 3 mg intravenous injection, administered every 3 months, was shown to be at least as \n\neffective as oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in a 2-year, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-\n\ninferiority study (BM16550) of postmenopausal women (1386 women aged 55 - 80) with osteoporosis \n\n(lumbar spine BMD T-score below -2.5 SD at baseline). This was demonstrated in both the primary \n\nanalysis at one year and in the confirmatory analysis at two years endpoint (Table 2). \n\n \n\nThe primary analysis of data from study BM16550 at one year and the confirmatory analysis at 2 years \n\ndemonstrated the non-inferiority of 3 mg every 3 months injection dosing regimen compared to 2.5 mg \n\noral daily dosing regimen, in terms of mean increases in BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck \n\nand trochanter (Table 2). \n\n \n\nTable 2: Mean relative change from baseline of lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and trochanter \n\nBMD after one year (primary analysis) and two years of treatment (Per-Protocol Population) in study \n\nBM 16550. \n\n \n\n One year data in study BM 16550 Two year data in study \n\nBM 16550 \n\nMean relative changes \n\nfrom baseline % [95% CI]  \n\nibandronic acid \n\n2.5 mg daily \n\n(N=377) \n\nBonviva 3 mg \n\ninjection every \n\n3 months \n\n(N=365) \n\nibandronic \n\nacid 2.5 mg \n\ndaily \n\n(N=334) \n\nBonviva 3 mg \n\ninjection every \n\n3 months \n\n(N=334) \n\nLumbar spine L2-L4 BMD 3.8 [3.4, 4.2] 4.8 [4.5, 5.2] 4.8 [4.3, 5.4] 6.3 [5.7, 6.8] \n\nTotal hip BMD 1.8 [1.5, 2.1] 2.4 [2.0, 2.7] 2.2 [1.8, 2.6] 3.1 [2.6, 3.6] \n\nFemoral neck BMD 1.6 [1.2, 2.0] 2.3 [1.9, 2.7] 2.2 [1.8, 2.7] 2.8 [2.3, 3.3] \n\nTrochanter BMD 3.0 [2.6, 3.4] 3.8 [3.2, 4.4] 3.5 [3.0, 4.0] 4.9 [4.1, 5.7] \n\n \n\nFurthermore, Bonviva 3 mg injection every 3 months was proven superior to oral ibandronic acid \n\n2.5 mg daily for increases in lumbar spine BMD in a prospectively planned analysis at one year, \n\np<0.001, and at two years, p<0.001.   \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nFor lumbar spine BMD, 92.1 % of patients receiving 3 mg injection every 3 months increased or \n\nmaintained their BMD after 1 year of treatment (i.e. were responders) compared with 84.9 % of \n\npatients receiving oral 2.5 mg daily (p=0.002). After 2 years of treatment, 92.8 % of patients receiving \n\n3 mg injections and 84.7 % of patient receiving 2.5 mg oral therapy had increased or maintained \n\nlumbar spine BMD (p=0.001). \n\n \n\nFor total hip BMD, 82.3 % of patients receiving 3 mg injection every 3 months were responders at one \n\nyear, compared with 75.1 % of patients receiving 2.5 mg daily orally (p=0.02). After 2 years of \n\ntreatment, 85.6 % of patients receiving 3 mg injections and 77.0 % of patient receiving 2.5 mg oral \n\ntherapy had increased or maintained total hip BMD (p=0.004). \n\n \n\nThe proportion of patients who increased or maintained their BMD at one year at both lumbar spine \n\nand total hip was 76.2 % in the 3 mg injection every 3 months arm and 67.2 % in the 2.5 mg daily \n\norally arm (p=0.007). At two years, 80.1 % and 68.8 % of patients met this criterion in the 3 mg every \n\n3 months injection arm and the 2.5 mg daily arm (p=0.001). \n\n \n\nBiochemical markers of bone turn-over \n\nClinically meaningful reductions in serum CTX levels were observed at all time points measured. At \n\n12 months median relative changes from baseline were \u201358.6 % for the intravenous injection of 3 mg \n\nevery 3 months regimen and \u201362.6 % for oral 2.5 mg daily regimen. In addition, 64.8 % of patients \n\nreceiving 3 mg every 3 months injection were identified as responders (defined as a decrease \u226550 % \n\nfrom baseline), compared with 64.9 % of patients receiving 2.5 mg daily orally. Serum CTX \n\nreduction was maintained over the 2 years, with more than half of the patients identified as responders \n\nin both treatment groups. \n\n \n\nBased on the results of study BM 16550, Bonviva 3 mg intravenous injection, administered every 3 \n\nmonths is expected to be at least as effective in preventing fractures as the oral regimen of ibandronic \n\nacid 2.5 mg daily. \n\n \n\nIbandronic acid 2.5 mg daily tablets \n\n \n\nIn the initial three-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fracture study (MF 4411), a \n\nstatistically significant and medically relevant decrease in the incidence of new radiographic \n\nmorphometric and clinical vertebral fractures was demonstrated (table 3). In this study, ibandronic \n\nacid was evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently as an exploratory regimen. \n\nIbandronic acid was taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink of the day (post-dose fasting \n\nperiod). The study enrolled women aged 55 to 80 years, who were at least 5 years postmenopausal, \n\nwho had a BMD at the lumbar spine of -2 to -5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at \n\nleast one vertebra [L1-L4], and who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures. All patients received \n\n500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily. Efficacy was evaluated in 2,928 patients. Ibandronic acid \n\n2.5 mg administered daily, showed a statistically significant and medically relevant reduction in the \n\nincidence of new vertebral fractures. This regimen reduced the occurrence of new radiographic \n\nvertebral fractures by 62 % (p=0.0001) over the three year duration of the study. A relative risk \n\nreduction of 61 % was observed after 2 years (p=0.0006). No statistically significant difference was \n\nattained after 1 year of treatment (p=0.056). The anti-fracture effect was consistent over the duration \n\nof the study. There was no indication of a waning of the effect over time.  \n\n \n\nThe incidence of clinical vertebral fractures was also significantly reduced by 49 % after 3 years \n\n(p=0.011). The strong effect on vertebral fractures was furthermore reflected by a statistically \n\nsignificant reduction of height loss compared to placebo (p<0.0001). \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nTable 3: Results from 3 years fracture study MF 4411 (%, 95 % CI) \n\n \n\n Placebo \n\n(N=974) \n\nibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily \n\n(N=977) \n\nRelative risk reduction \n\nNew morphometric vertebral \n\nfractures \n\n 62% (40.9, 75.1) \n\nIncidence of new morphometric \n\nvertebral fractures \n\n9.56% (7.5, 11.7) 4.68% (3.2, 6.2) \n\nRelative risk reduction of clinical \n\nvertebral fracture \n\n 49%  \n\n(14.03, 69.49) \n\nIncidence of clinical vertebral \n\nfracture \n\n5.33% (3.73, 6.92) 2.75%  \n\n(1.61, 3.89) \n\nBMD \u2013 mean change relative to \n\nbaseline lumbar spine at year 3 \n\n1.26% (0.8, 1.7) 6.54% (6.1, 7.0) \n\nBMD \u2013 mean change relative to \n\nbaseline total hip at year 3 \n\n-0.69% \n\n(-1.0, -0.4) \n\n3.36% \n\n(3.0, 3.7) \n\n \n\nThe treatment effect of ibandronic acid was further assessed in an analysis of the subpopulation of \n\npatients who, at baseline, had a lumbar spine BMD T-score below \u20132.5 (table 4).

Increases at the hip compared to baseline were 2.8 % at the femoral neck, 3.4 % at the total \n\nhip, and 5.5 % at the trochanter. \n\n \n\nBiochemical markers of bone turnover (such as urinary CTX and serum Osteocalcin) showed the \n\nexpected pattern of suppression to premenopausal levels and reached maximum suppression within a \n\nperiod of 3 - 6 months of using 2.5 mg ibandronic acid daily. \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nA clinically meaningful reduction of 50 % of biochemical markers of bone resorption was observed as \n\nearly as one month after starting treatment with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg. \n\nPaediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.2).  \n\nBonviva was not studied in the paediatric population, therefore no efficacy or safety data are available \n\nfor this patient population.  \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nThe primary pharmacological effects of ibandronic acid on bone are not directly related to actual \n\nplasma concentrations, as demonstrated by various studies in animals and humans.  \n\nPlasma concentrations of ibandronic acid increase in a dose-proportional manner after intravenous \n\nadministration of 0.5 mg to 6 mg. \n\nAbsorption \n\nNot applicable \n\nDistribution \n\nAfter initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine. In \n\nhumans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 l and the amount of dose reaching \n\nthe bone is estimated to be 40 \u2013 50 % of the circulating dose. Protein binding in human plasma is \n\napproximately 85 % - 87 % (determined in vitro at therapeutic ibandronic acid concentrations), and \n\nthus there is a low potential for interaction with other medicinal products due to displacement. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nThere is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolised in animals or humans. \n\nElimination \n\nIbandronic acid is removed from the circulation via bone absorption (estimated to be 40 \u2013 50 % in \n\npostmenopausal women) and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by the kidney.  \n\nThe range of observed apparent half-lives is broad, the apparent terminal half-life is generally in the \n\nrange of 10 - 72 hours. As the values calculated are largely a function of the duration of study, the \n\ndose used, and assay sensitivity, the true terminal half-life is likely to be substantially longer, in \n\ncommon with other bisphosphonates. Early plasma levels fall quickly, reaching 10 % of the peak \n\nvalues within 3 and 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration, respectively.  \n\nTotal clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range 84 - 160 ml/min. Renal \n\nclearance (about 60 ml/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50 \u2013 60 % of total \n\nclearance, and is related to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total and renal \n\nclearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone. \n\nThe secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the \n\nexcretion of other active substances.(see section 4.5). In addition, ibandronic acid does not inhibit the \n\nmajor human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and does not induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in \n\nrats. \n\nPharmacokinetics in special clinical situations \n\nGender \n\nPharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid are similar in men and women. \n\nRace \n\nThere is no evidence for any clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences between Asians and \n\nCaucasians in ibandronic acid disposition. There is limited data available on patients of African origin. \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPatients with renal impairment  \n\nRenal clearance of ibandronic acid in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly \n\nrelated to creatinine clearance (CLcr).  \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr equal or \n\nabove 30 ml/min).  \n\n \n\nSubjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 ml/min) receiving daily oral administration \n\nof 10 mg ibandronic acid for 21 days, had 2 - 3 fold higher plasma concentrations than subjects with \n\nnormal renal function and total clearance of ibandronic acid was 44 ml/min. After intravenous \n\nadministration of 0.5 mg of ibandronic acid, total, renal, and non-renal clearances decreased by 67 %, \n\n77 % and 50 %, respectively, in subjects with severe renal failure, but there was no reduction in \n\ntolerability associated with the increase in exposure. Due to the limited clinical experience, Bonviva is \n\nnot recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2 and section 4.4). The \n\npharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid in patients with end-stage renal disease was only assessed in a \n\nsmall number of patients managed by haemodialysis, therefore, the pharmacokinetics of ibandronic \n\nacid in the patients not undergoing haemodialysis is unknown. Due to the limited data available, \n\nibandronic acid should not be used in all patients with end-stage renal disease. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) \n\nThere are no pharmacokinetic data for ibandronic acid in patients who have hepatic impairment. The \n\nliver has no significant role in the clearance of ibandronic acid, which is not metabolised but is cleared \n\nby renal excretion and by uptake into bone. Therefore dose adjustment is not necessary in patients \n\nwith hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nElderly population (see section 4.2) \n\nIn a multivariate analysis, age was not found to be an independent factor of any of the \n\npharmacokinetic parameters studied. As renal function decreases with age, renal function is the only \n\nfactor to take into consideration (see renal impairment section). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.1) \n\nThere are no data on the use of Bonviva in these age groups.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nToxic effects, e.g. signs of renal damage, were observed in dogs only at exposures considered \n\nsufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure, indicating little relevance to clinical use.  \n\n \n\nMutagenicity/Carcinogenicity: \n\nNo indication of carcinogenic potential was observed. Tests for genotoxicity revealed no evidence of \n\ngenetic activity for ibandronic acid. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity: \n\nSpecific studies for the 3-monthly dosing regimen have not been performed. In studies with daily i.v. \n\ndosing regimen, there was no evidence for a direct foetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid \n\nin rats and rabbits. Body weight gain was decreased in F1 offspring in rats. In reproductive studies in \n\nrats by the oral route effects on fertility consisted of increased preimplantation losses at dose levels of \n\n1 mg/kg/day and higher. In reproductive studies in rats by the intravenous route, ibandronic acid \n\ndecreased sperm counts at doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day and decreased fertility in males at 1 \n\nmg/kg/day and in females at 1.2 mg/kg/day. Other adverse reactions to ibandronic acid in reproductive \n\ntoxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class. They include a \n\ndecreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase \n\nin visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n41 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nBonviva \n\n150 mg film-coated tablets \n\nIbandronic acid \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n\n1. What Bonviva is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Bonviva \n\n3. How to take Bonviva \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Bonviva \n\n6. Content of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Bonviva is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nBonviva belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates. It contains the active substance \n\nibandronic acid. Bonviva may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing bone \n\nmass in most women who take it, even though they won\u2019t be able to see or feel a difference. Bonviva \n\nmay help lower the chances of breaking bones (fractures). This reduction in fractures was shown for \n\nthe spine but not for the hip. \n\n \n\nBonviva is prescribed to you to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis because you have an \n\nincreased risk of fractures. Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones, which is common \n\nin women after the menopause. At the menopause, a woman\u2019s ovaries stop producing the female \n\nhormone, oestrogen, which helps to keep her skeleton healthy. \n\n \n\nThe earlier a woman reaches the menopause, the greater her risk of fractures in osteoporosis.  \n\n \n\nOther things that can increase the risk of fractures include: \n\n\u2022 not enough calcium and vitamin D in the diet \n\n\u2022 smoking, or drinking too much alcohol \n\n\u2022 not enough walking or other weight-bearing exercise \n\n\u2022 a family history of osteoporosis. \n\n \n\nA healthy lifestyle will also help you to get the most benefit from your treatment. This includes:  \n\n\u2022 eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D  \n\n\u2022 walking or any other weight-bearing exercise  \n\n\u2022 not smoking; and not drinking too much alcohol. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Bonviva \n\n \n\nDo not take Bonviva \n\n\u2022 If you are allergic to ibandronic acid, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in \n\nsection 6. \n\n\u2022 If you have certain problems with your gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) such as narrowing or \n\ndifficulty swallowing. \n\n\u2022 If you can\u2019t stand or sit upright for at least one hour (60 minutes) at a time. \n\n\u2022 If you have, or had in the past low blood calcium. Please consult your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very \n\nrarely in the post marketing setting in patients receiving Bonviva for osteoporosis.  ONJ can also occur \n\nafter stopping treatment.  \n\n \n\nIt is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to \n\ntreat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions \n\nyou should take. \n\n \n\nBefore receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if: \n\n\u2022 you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \n\nplanned tooth extraction \n\n\u2022 you don\u2019t receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time \n\n\u2022 you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems) \n\n\u2022 you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \n\ndisorders) \n\n\u2022 you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) \n\n\u2022 you have cancer. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Bonviva. \n\n \n\nWhile being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and \n\nreceive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you \n\nare under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor \n\nabout your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Bonviva. \n\n \n\nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth \n\nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of \n\nosteonecrosis of the jaw. \n\n \n\nSome people need to be especially careful while they\u2019re taking Bonviva. Talk to your doctor before \n\ntaking Bonviva: \n\n\u2022 If you have any disturbances of mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency).  \n\n\u2022 If your kidneys are not functioning normally. \n\n\u2022 If you have any swallowing or digestive problems. \n\n \n\nIrritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) often with symptoms of \n\nsevere pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting \n\nmay occur, especially if you do not drink a full glass of water and/or if you lie down within an hour of \n\ntaking Bonviva. If you develop these symptoms, stop taking Bonviva and tell your doctor straight \n\naway (see section 3). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not give Bonviva to children or adolescents below 18 years. \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nOther medicines and Bonviva \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Especially: \n\n \n\n\u2022 Supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium, as they could possibly \n\ninfluence the effects of Bonviva. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Acetylsalicylic acid and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) (including \n\nibuprofen, diclofenac sodium and naproxen) may irritate the stomach and intestine. Bonviva \n\nmay also do so. So be especially careful if you take painkillers or anti-inflammatories while \n\nyou\u2019re taking Bonviva.  \n\n \n\nAfter swallowing your monthly Bonviva tablet, wait for 1 hour before taking any other medication, \n\nincluding indigestion tablets, calcium supplements, or vitamins. \n\n \n\nBonviva with food and drink: \n\nDo not take Bonviva with food. Bonviva is less effective if it\u2019s taken with food. \n\nYou can drink water but no other drinks  \n\n \n\nAfter you have taken Bonviva, please wait for 1 hour before you can have your first food and further \n\ndrinks. (see 3. How to take Bonviva). \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast feeding \n\nBonviva is for use only by postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women who could still \n\nhave a baby.  \n\nDo not take Bonviva if you are pregnant or breast feeding.  \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYou can drive and use machines as it\u2019s expected that Bonviva has no or negligible effect on your \n\nability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nBonviva contains lactose. \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you cannot tolerate or digest some sugars (e.g. if you have a \n\ngalactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or have problems with glucose-galactose \n\nabsorption), talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Bonviva \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Bonviva is one tablet once a month. \n\n \n\nTaking your monthly tablet \n\nIt\u2019s important to follow these instructions carefully. They are designed to help your Bonviva tablet \n\nreach your stomach quickly, so it\u2019s less likely to cause irritation. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Take one Bonviva 150 mg tablet once a month. \n\n\u2022 Choose one day of the month that will be easy to remember. You can choose either the same \n\ndate (such as the 1st of each month) or the same day (such as the first Sunday of each month) to \n\ntake your Bonviva tablet. Choose the date that best fits your routine. \n\n\u2022 Take your Bonviva tablet at least 6 hours after you last had anything to eat or drink except \n\nwater. \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n\u2022 Take your Bonviva tablet \n\n\u2022 after you first get up for the day, and \n\n\u2022 before you have anything to eat or drink (on an empty stomach). \n\n \n\n\u2022 Swallow your tablet with a full glass of water (at least 180 ml).  \n\n \n\nDo not take your tablet with water with a high concentration of calcium, fruit juice or any other \n\ndrinks. If there is a concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard water), \n\nit is advised to use bottled water with a low mineral content. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Swallow your tablet whole, do not chew it, crush it or let it dissolve in your mouth. \n\n \n\n\u2022 For the next hour (60 minutes) after you\u2019ve taken your tablet \n\n\u2022 do not lie down; if you do not stay upright (standing or sitting), some of the medicine \n\ncould leak back into your oesophagus \n\n \n\n\u2022 do not eat anything \n\n \n\n\u2022 do not drink anything (except water if you need it) \n\n\u2022 do not take any other medicines. \n\n \n\n\u2022 After you\u2019ve waited for an hour, you can have your first food and drink of the day. Once you\u2019ve \n\neaten, it\u2019s OK to lie down if you wish, and to take any other medication you need. \n\n \n\nContinuing to take Bonviva \n\nIt\u2019s important to keep taking Bonviva every month, as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. After \n\n5 years of  using Bonviva, please consult with your doctor whether you should continue to take \n\nBonviva. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Bonviva than you should \n\nIf you\u2019ve taken more than one tablet by mistake, drink a full glass of milk and talk to your doctor \n\nstraight away. \n\n \n\nDo not make yourself vomit, and do not lie down \u2014 this could cause Bonviva to irritate your \n\noesophagus. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Bonviva \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you forget to take your tablet on the morning of your chosen day, do not take a tablet later \n\nin the day.  \n\nInstead, consult your calendar and find out when your next scheduled dose is. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n\u2022 If you forgot to take your tablet on your chosen day and your next scheduled dose is only 1 \n\nto 7 days away\u2026 \n\n \n\nNever take two Bonviva tablets within the same week. You should wait until the next \n\nscheduled dose is due and take it as normal; then, continue taking one tablet once a month on \n\nthe scheduled days you\u2019ve marked on your calendar.  \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you forgot to take your tablet on your chosen day and your next scheduled dose is more \n\nthan 7 days away\u2026  \n\nYou should take one tablet the next morning after the day you remember; then, continue taking \n\none tablet once a month on the scheduled days you\u2019ve marked on your calendar. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

Content of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Bonviva is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nBonviva belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates. It contains the active substance \n\nibandronic acid.  \n\nBonviva may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing bone mass in most \n\nwomen who take it, even though they won\u2019t be able to see or feel a difference. Bonviva  may help \n\nlower the chances of breaking bones (fractures). This reduction in fractures was shown for the spine \n\nbut not for the hip. \n\n \n\nBonviva is prescribed to you to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis because you have an \n\nincreased risk of fractures. Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones, which is common \n\nin women after the menopause. At the menopause, a woman\u2019s ovaries stop producing the female \n\nhormone, oestrogen, which helps to keep her skeleton healthy. The earlier a woman reaches the \n\nmenopause, the greater her risk of fractures in osteoporosis. \n\n \n\nOther things that can increase the risk of fractures include: \n\n\u2022 not enough calcium and vitamin D in the diet \n\n\u2022 smoking cigarettes, or drinking too much alcohol \n\n\u2022 not enough walking or other weight-bearing exercise \n\n\u2022 a family history of osteoporosis. \n\n \n\nA healthy lifestyle will also help you to get the most benefit from your treatment. This includes: \n\n\u2022 eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D  \n\n\u2022 walking or other weight-bearing exercise \n\n\u2022 not smoking and not drinking too much alcohol.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you receive Bonviva  \n\n \n\nDo not receive Bonviva \n\n\u2022 if you have, or had in the past, low blood calcium. Please consult your doctor \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic to ibandronic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very \n\nrarely in the post marketing setting in patients receiving Bonviva for osteoporosis.  ONJ can also occur \n\nafter stopping treatment.  \n\n \n\nIt is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to \n\ntreat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions \n\nyou should take. \n\n \n\nBefore receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if: \n\n\u2022 you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a \n\nplanned tooth extraction \n\n\u2022 you don\u2019t receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time \n\n\u2022 you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems) \n\n\u2022 you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \n\ndisorders) \n\n\u2022 you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) \n\n\u2022 you have cancer. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Bonviva. \n\n \n\nWhile being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and \n\nreceive routine dental check-ups.  If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you \n\nare under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor \n\nabout your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Bonviva. \n\n \n\nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth \n\nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of \n\nosteonecrosis of the jaw. \n\n \n\nSome patients need to be especially careful when using Bonviva. Talk to your doctor before receiving \n\nBonviva: \n\n\u2022 If you have or have ever had kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed dialysis, or if you \n\nhave any other disease that may affect your kidneys  \n\n\u2022 If you have any disturbance of mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) \n\n\u2022 You should take calcium and vitamin-D supplements while receiving Bonviva. If you are \n\n unable to do so, you should inform your doctor \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you have heart problems and the doctor recommended to limit your daily fluid intake. \n\n \n\nCases of serious, sometimes fatal allergic reaction have been reported in patients treated with \n\nintravenous ibandronic acid. If you experience one of the following symptoms, such as shortness of \n\nbreath/difficulty breathing, tight feeling in throat, swelling of tongue, dizziness, feeling of loss of \n\nconsciousness, redness or swelling of face, body rash, nausea and vomiting, you should immediately \n\nalert your doctor or nurse (see section 4). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \n\nBonviva must not be used in children or adolescents below 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Bonviva \n\nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nBonviva is for use only by postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women who could still \n\nhave a baby.  \n\nDo not take Bonviva if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.  \n\n\n\n51 \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYou can drive and use machines as it\u2019s expected that Bonviva has no or negligible effect on your \n\nability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\nBonviva contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose (3 ml), i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to receive Bonviva  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Bonviva for the intravenous injection is 3 mg (1 pre-filled syringe) once \n\nevery 3 months. \n\n \n\nThe injection should be given into the vein by a physician or qualified/trained health care worker. Do \n\nnot administer the injection to yourself. \n\n \n\nThe solution for injection must be administered into a vein only, and not anywhere else in the body. \n\n \n\nContinuing to receive Bonviva \n\nTo get the most benefit from the treatment it is important to continue receiving the injections every 3 \n\nmonths for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. Bonviva can treat osteoporosis only for as long \n\nas you keep receiving the treatment, even though you will not be able to see or feel a difference. After \n\n5 years of receiving Bonviva, please consult with your doctor whether you should continue to receive \n\nBonviva. \n\n \n\nYou should also take calcium and vitamin-D supplements, as recommended by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf too much Bonviva is given \n\nYou may develop low levels of calcium, phosphorus or magnesium in the blood. Your doctor may \n\ntake steps to correct such changes and may give you an injection containing these minerals. \n\n \n\nIf a dose of Bonviva is missed \n\nYou should arrange an appointment to get the next injection as soon as possible. After that, go back to \n\ngetting the injections every 3 months from the date of the most recent injection.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nTalk to a nurse or a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects - \n\nyou may need urgent medical treatment: \n\n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): \n\n\u2022 itching, swelling of your face, lips, tongue and throat, with difficulty breathing  \n\n\u2022 persistent eye pain and inflammation (if prolonged) \n\n\u2022 new pain, weakness or discomfort in your thigh, hip or groin.

If you inadvertently inject into the tissues around the vein, patients may experience local \n\nirritation, pain and inflammation at the injection site. \n\n \n\nBonviva 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe must not be mixed with calcium-containing \n\nsolutions (such as Ringer-Lactate solution, calcium heparin) or other intravenously administered \n\nmedicinal products. Where Bonviva is administered via an existing intravenous infusion line, the \n\nintravenous infusate should be restricted to either isotonic saline or 50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose solution. \n\n \n\nMissed dose: \n\nIf a dose is missed, the injection should be administered as soon as convenient. Thereafter, injections \n\nshould be scheduled every 3 months from the date of the last injection. \n\n \n\nOverdose: \n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Bonviva.  \n\n \n\nBased on knowledge of this class of compounds, intravenous overdosage may result in hypocalcaemia, \n\nhypophosphataemia, and hypomagnesaemia, which can cause paraesthesia. In severe cases \n\nintravenous infusion of appropriate doses of calcium gluconate, potassium or sodium phosphate, and \n\nmagnesium sulfate, may be needed. \n\n \n\nGeneral advice: \n\nBonviva 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe like other bisphosphonates administered \n\nintravenously, may cause a transient decrease in serum calcium values. \n\n \n\nHypocalcaemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be assessed and \n\neffectively treated before starting Bonviva injection therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and \n\nvitamin D is important in all patients. All patients must receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D. \n\n \n\nPatients with concomitant diseases, or who use medicinal products which have a potential for \n\nundesirable effects on the kidney, should be reviewed regularly in line with good medical practice \n\nduring treatment.  \n\n \n\nAny unused solution for injection, syringe and injection needle should be disposed of in accordance \n\nwith local requirements. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.\tMANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\r\n\n\tB.

"Section_Content": "do not take bonviva if you are allergic to ibandronic acid, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6. if you have certain problems with your gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) such as narrowing or difficulty swallowing. if you can't stand or sit upright for at least one hour (60 minutes) at a time. if you have, or had in the past low blood calcium. please consult your doctor. warnings and precautions a side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (onj) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very rarely in the post marketing setting in patients receiving bonviva for osteoporosis. onj can also occur after stopping treatment. it is important to try and prevent onj developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. in order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions you should take. before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if: you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a planned tooth extraction you don't receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems) you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders) you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) you have cancer. your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with bonviva. while being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. if you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. if you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with bonviva. contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. some people need to be especially careful while they're taking bonviva. talk to your doctor before taking bonviva: if you have any disturbances of mineral metabolism (such as vitamin d deficiency). if your kidneys are not functioning normally. if you have any swallowing or digestive problems. irritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) often with symptoms of severe pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting may occur, especially if you do not drink a full glass of water and/or if you lie down within an hour of taking bonviva. if you develop these symptoms, stop taking bonviva and tell your doctor straight away (see section 3). children and adolescents do not give bonviva to children or adolescents below 18 years. other medicines and bonviva tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. especially: supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium, as they could possibly influence the effects of bonviva. acetylsalicylic acid and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (nsaids) (including ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium and naproxen) may irritate the stomach and intestine. bonviva may also do so. so be especially careful if you take painkillers or anti-inflammatories while you're taking bonviva. after swallowing your monthly bonviva tablet, wait for 1 hour before taking any other medication, including indigestion tablets, calcium supplements, or vitamins. bonviva with food and drink: do not take bonviva with food. bonviva is less effective if it's taken with food. you can drink water but no other drinks after you have taken bonviva, please wait for 1 hour before you can have your first food and further drinks.
