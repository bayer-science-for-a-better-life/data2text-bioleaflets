This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nSpherox 10-70 spheroids/cm2 implantation suspension \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\n2.1 General description \n\n \n\nSpheroids of human autologous matrix-associated chondrocytes for implantation suspended in isotonic \n\nsodium chloride solution. \n\n \n\n2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition \n\n \n\nSpheroids are spherical aggregates of ex vivo expanded human autologous chondrocytes and self-\n\nsynthesized extracellular matrix. \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe or applicator contains a specific number of spheroids according to the defect \n\nsize (10-70 spheroids/cm2) to be treated. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nImplantation suspension. \n\n \n\nWhite to yellowish spheroids of matrix-associated autologous chondrocytes in a clear, colourless \n\nsolution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRepair of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and the patella of the knee \n\n(International Cartilage Regeneration & Joint Preservation Society [ICRS] grade III or IV) with defect \n\nsizes up to 10 cm2 in adults.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nSpherox is intended for autologous use only. It must be administered by a specialised orthopedic \n\nsurgeon and in a medical facility. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\n10-70 spheroids are applied per square centimetre defect. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Spherox in children aged 15 to 18 years have not been established.  \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Spherox in children aged less than 15 years have not been established. No \n\ndata are available. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Spherox in patients aged over 50 years have not been established. No data \n\nare available.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor intraarticular use. \n\n  \n\nSpherox is administered to patients by intraarticular implantation. \n\n \n\nThe implantation must be performed during a surgical procedure (preferably an arthroscopy or mini-\n\narthrotomy). A debridement of the defect area is required. The subchondral plate should not be \n\ndamaged. The spheroids are provided in a pre-filled syringe or an applicator (stem length 150 mm \n\n(co.fix 150)). Spheroids should be applied evenly on the defect ground and, if necessary, spread over \n\nthe whole defect area by means of surgical instruments. The spheroids self-adhere within 20 minutes \n\nonto the defect ground. Afterwards, the surgical wound can be closed without any additional cover of \n\nthe treated area (e.g. periosteal flap; matrix), or any fixation of spheroids by using fibrin glue. The \n\ntreatment of defect sizes up to 10 cm2 is eligible for single as well as adjacent defects (combined area). \n\n \n\nPatients treated with Spherox have to undergo a specific rehabilitation program (see section 4.4). The \n\nprogram may take up to one year depending on the recommendation of the physician. \n\n \n\nFor information on preparation and handling of Spherox, please refer to section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\u2022 Patients with not fully closed epiphyseal growth plate in the affected joint. \n\n\u2022 Primary (generalised) osteoarthritis. \n\n\u2022 Advanced osteoarthritis of the affected joint (exceeding grade II according to Kellgren and \nLawrence). \n\n\u2022 Infection with the hepatitits B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV I/II. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nSpherox is an autologous medicinal product and must not be given to any other patient than the donor. \n\n \n\nPrior to use, it must be verified if patient name matches the information of the patient/donor provided \n\non the shipping documents and the product label. Also it needs to be checked if the correct order \n\nnumber (lot number) is on the primary package. \n\nIf the primary or secondary packaging is damaged and therefore unsterile, Spherox must not be \n\napplied. \n\n \n\nThe application of Spherox in patients with cartilage defects outside the knee joint is not \n\nrecommended. The safety and efficacy of Spherox in patients with cartilage defects outside the \n\nfemoral condyle and the patella of the knee have not been established. No data are available.  \n\n \n\nPrecautions for use \n\n \n\nPatients with local inflammations or acute as well as recent bone or joint infections should be \n\ntemporarily deferred until the recovery from the infection is documented. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIn the pivotal studies of Spherox, patients were excluded if they had signs of chronic inflammatory \n\ndiseases. \n\n \n\nConcomitant joint problems like early osteoarthritis, subchondral bone defects, instability of the joint, \n\nlesions of ligaments or of the meniscus, abnormal weight distribution in the joint, varus or valgus \n\nmalalignment, patellar malalignment or instability, and metabolic, inflammatory, immunological or \n\nneoplastic diseases of the affected joint are potential complicating factors. Untreated bone oedema \n\ncorresponding with the cartilage defect to be treated may adversely affect the success of the procedure. \n\nIf possible, concomitant joint problems should be corrected prior to or at the latest at the time of \n\nSpherox implantation. \n\n \n\nFor decision on treatment of facing defects (\u201ckissing lesions\u201d larger than ICRS grade II) the degree of \n\noverlap and location of the defects in the joint have to be taken into consideration. \n\n \n\nPost-operative haemarthrosis occurs mainly in patients with a predisposition to haemorrhage or poor \n\nsurgical haemorrhage control. The patient\u2019s haemostatic functions should be screened prior to surgery. \n\nThromboprophylaxis should be administered according to local guidelines. \n\n \n\nApplication of Spherox in obese patients is not recommended. \n\n \n\nRehabilitation \n\n \n\nAfter implantation, the patient should follow an appropriate rehabilitation schedule. Physical activity \n\nshould be resumed as recommended by the physician. Too early and vigorous activity may \n\ncompromise the grafting and the durability of clinical benefit from Spherox. \n\n \n\nCompliance with an adequate rehabilitation programme after implantation (especially for patients with \n\nmental disorders or addiction) should be warranted. \n\n \n\nCases in which Spherox cannot be supplied \n\n \n\nIf the manufacturing of spheroids has failed or if the release criteria are not fulfilled, e.g. due to \n\ninsufficient biopsy quality, the medicinal product cannot be delivered. The physician will be informed \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\nLocally applied antibiotics or disinfectants may have potential toxicity on articular cartilage and it is \n\nnot recommended that Spherox comes into direct contact with those substances. \n\nIn the pivotal studies of Spherox, patients were excluded if they were under medical treatment with \n\ncorticosteroids. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for autologous chondrocytes or spheroids from \n\nautologous chondrocytes. \n\nAs Spherox is used to repair cartilage defects of the joint and is therefore implanted during a surgical \n\nprocedure, it is not recommended for use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data on possible effects of Spherox treatment on fertility. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nThe surgical procedure will have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Also, \n\nduring the rehabilitation period, the ability to drive and use machines may be restricted due to reduced \n\nmobility. Therefore, patients should consult their treating physician and follow his/her advice strictly. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\n \n\nInformation on adverse reactions in 127 patients from pivotal clinical trials are available. During \n\ntreatment with Spherox surgery-related (implantation) or Spherox-related adverse reactions may \n\noccur. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions related to Spherox are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 1 \n\nbelow: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n\n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Undesirable Effects related to Spherox \n\nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Frequency Adverse Reaction \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue disorders \n\nVery common Joint effusion, \n\nArthralgia,  \n\nJoint swelling \n\nCommon Bone marrow oedema, \n\nJoint noise, \n\nJoint lock, \n\nSynovial cyst \n\nUncommon Chondromalacia, \n\nOsteochondrosis, \n\nOsteonecrosis, \n\nExtraskeletal ossification \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nCommon Pain, \n\nGait disturbance \n\nInjury, poisoning and \n\nprocedural complications \n\nUncommon Hypertrophy, \n\nGraft delamination \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nGraft delamination \n\nGraft delamination describes the partial or complete detachment of the formed tissue from the \n\nsubchondral bone and the surrounding cartilage. A complete graft delamination is a serious \n\ncomplication which can be accompanied by pain. Risk factors are in particular non-treatment of \n\nconcomitant diseases, such as joint instability or to renege on the rehabilitation protocol. \n\n \n\nHypertrophy of the transplant \n\nA symptomatic hypertrophy of the transplant may occur during treatment with Spherox resulting in \n\npain. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions related to the surgical procedure: \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThe following adverse reactions considered surgery-related have been reported during the course of the \n\nclinical trials and/or from spontaneous sources: \n\n\u2022 SOC Vascular disorders: lymphoedema (common), thrombophlebitis (common), deep vein \nthrombosis (uncommon), haematoma (uncommon) \n\n\u2022 SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: scar pain (common) \n\n\u2022 SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: joint effusion (very common), arthralgia \n(very common), joint swelling (very common), tendonitis (common), muscular weakness \n\n(common), patellofemoral pain syndrome (common), osteonecrosis (uncommon) \n\n\u2022 SOC General disorders and administration site conditions: pain (common), gait disturbance \n(common), discomfort (uncommon) \n\n\u2022 SOC Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: ligament sprain (common), suture-related \ncomplication (uncommon), wound dehiscence (uncommon)  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn cases where the recommended dose was significantly exceeded (up to 170 spheroids/cm\u00b2 in an \n\ninvestigator-initiated trial with a follow-up period of 12 months), no negative effects were observed. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for disorders of the musculo-skeletal system, ATC code: \n\nM09AX02  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nAutologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is based on the extraction of the patient\u2019s own \n\nchondrocytes isolated from healthy cartilage, their culture in vitro and their subsequent implantation \n\ninto the cartilage defect. Spherox is cultured and implanted as three-dimensional spheroids.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nSince 2004, Spherox has been available on a named patient basis for the treatment of cartilage defects \n\nclassified as Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 or ICRS grade III or IV (Outerbridge 1961, ICRS Cartilage \n\nInjury Evaluation Package 2000). Mainly, patients were treated with cartilage defects in knee. \n\n \n\nSpherox has been analysed in a prospective, randomized, uncontrolled open-label, multicentre Phase II \n\nclinical trial including 75 patients with focal cartilage defects (ICRS grade III or IV) in the knee with a \n\ndefect size of 4-10 cm2. Twenty-five patients were treated with 10-30 spheroids/cm\u00b2 defect, 25 with \n\n40-70 spheroids/cm\u00b2 defect and 25 with 3-7 spheroids/cm\u00b2 defect. The intention-to-treat (ITT) \n\npopulation consisted of 73 patients. The mean patient age was 34 years (range 19 to 48 years) with a \n\nmean body mass index (BMI) of 25.2. In all three dose groups a significant improvement (\u03b1 < 0.05) of \n\nthe KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) after 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months \n\ncompared to before treatment could be observed. For \u2018all dose groups\u2019 the mean overall KOOS \n\nincreased in the first year after treatment from 57.0 \u00b1 15.2 to 73.4 \u00b1 17.3 on a scale from 0 (worst) to \n\n100 (best) and continued to increase slightly, reaching 74.6 \u00b1 17.6 after 18 months, 73.8 \u00b1 18.4 after \n\ntwo years, 77.0 \u00b1 17.8 after three years, 77.1 \u00b1 18.6 after four years and 76.9 \u00b1 19.3 at final follow-up \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nafter five years. Changes within each dose group were of similar magnitude, and the three between-\n\ngroup (pairwise) analyses did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the groups.  \n\nFurther patient scores, e.g. the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC; subjective \n\nevaluation of the knee) and the Lysholm score showed after 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months also a \n\nsignificant improvement in comparison to the value before treatment.  \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results according to the Magnetic Resonance Observation of \n\nCartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scoring system (0 = worst result; 100 = best result) showed an \n\nimprovement within the first 60 months from 59.8 at Visit 2 (3 months after treatment) up to \n\n75.0 points in the group of patients treated with 3-7 spheroids/cm\u00b2 defect, from 64.5 at Visit 2 up to \n\n76.4 points in the dose group of 10-30 spheroids/cm\u00b2 defect, and from 64.7 at Visit 2 up to 73.6 points \n\nin the dose group of 40-70 spheroids/cm\u00b2 defect. \n\n \n\nFurthermore, a multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled Phase III clinical trial is ongoing. The \n\nobjective of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the treatment of cartilage defects (1 to \n\nless than 4 cm2) at the femoral condyle of the knee joint with Spherox and microfracture treatment \n\nover a period of 5 years. Pivotal efficacy data were based on an interim analysis at 12 months after \n\ntreatment. Additional statistical assessments were performed 24 and 36 months after treatment.  \n\n \n\nThe treatment groups were balanced with respect to size, demography and disease background. The \n\nanalysis population comprised 102 patients (41 women, 61 men) aged 37 years on average (range from \n\n18 to 49 years) with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 25.8. Defect sizes ranged from 0.5 to 4 cm2. \n\nICRS grades were mostly IV A, followed by IIIB and IIIA (56, 23 and 10 patients respectively). None \n\nof the patients had received prior treatment with microfracture for their lesion less than one year \n\nbefore screening.  \n\nThe assessment of the \u2018overall KOOS\u2019 for the ITT population showed that both treatments yielded a \n\nstatistically significant improvement relative to baseline (day before arthroscopy). For the patients \n\ntreated with Spherox the mean overall KOOS (scale of 0-100 \u00b1 SD) increased from 56.6 \u00b1 15.4 at \n\nbaseline to 78.7 \u00b1 18.6 at the follow-up visit 12 months after treatment, improved up to the 24 months \n\nvisit to 81.5 \u00b1 17.3, reached 83.2 \u00b1 14.9 at the 36 months visit and 84.4 \u00b1 15.8 at the 48 months visit. \n\nFor patients treated by microfracture the mean overall KOOS increased from 51.7 \u00b1 16.5 to \n\n68.1 \u00b1 18.6 after 12 months, 72.6 \u00b1 19.5 after 24 months, 76.3 \u00b1 17.1 after 36 months and 76.5 \u00b1 18.2 \n\nafter 48 months (p < 0.0001 in all cases for both treatment groups). With regard to the between-group \n\nanalysis, the treatment with Spherox passed the test of non-inferiority compared with microfracture (\u0394 \n\nof 5.7 with lower bound of CI equal to \u20131.0 at the 12 months assessment, \u0394 of 6.1 with lower bound of \n\nCI equal to \u20130.4 at the 24 months assessment, \u0394 of 4.5 with lower bound of CI equal to -1.3 at the 36 \n\nmonths assessment, and \u0394 of 5.5 with lower bound of CI equal to -0.7 at the 48 months assessment). \n\nThe total MOCART scores 3, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 months after treatment did not differ substantially \n\nbetween the two treatment groups. \n\nIKDC subscores as well as results from the IKDC Current Health Assessment Form and the modified \n\nLysholm score also revealed overall improvements from baseline in both treatment groups with \n\nnumerically slightly better results in the Spherox group but with no statistical significance. \n\n \n\nFurther follow-up assessments of up to 5 years will be performed to generate long-term efficacy data \n\non the treatment with Spherox. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nDue to the nature and intended clinical use of Spherox, conventional studies on pharmacokinetics, \n\nabsorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination are not applicable. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nEx vivo produced spheroids were implanted in mice (subcutaneous implantation of cartilage explants \n\nwith human spheroids) or in minipigs (autologous spheroids implanted in cartilage defects). No signs \n\nof inflammation, synovitis, infections, rejection, hypertrophy or immune toxicity, tumourigenicity or \n\nbiodistribution were observed.  \n\nA GLP-compliant examination of biodistribution and tumourigenicity in NSG mice showed no signs \n\nof biodistribution and/or migration from implanted human spheroids. No suspicion of potential \n\ntumourigenesis or increased prevalence of tumours due to the implanted spheroids was observed. In a \n\nsheep study, also no biodistribution was observed after injection of spheroids into the knee joint. \n\nThis suggests that there are no risks for the use of spheroids in humans. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n\n \n\nSodium chloride \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n\n \n\nIn absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product should not be mixed with other medicinal \n\nproducts.  \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n\n \n\n72 hours  \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nStore at temperatures between 1 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C. \n\nDo not freeze. \n\nDo not irradiate. \n\nDo not open the outer packaging before use to prevent microbial contamination. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container and special equipment for use, administration or \n\nimplantation \n\n \n\nThe spheroids are provided in an applicator or a pre-filled syringe as primary packaging unit. \n\n \n\nThe applicator (stem length 150 mm (co.fix 150)) is packed in a sterile tube and additionally \n\nsurrounded by an extra bag. A tube may contain a maximum of two co.fix 150. The catheter of the \n\napplicator is made of thermoplastic polyurethane, the sealing plug on one side of acrylonitrile \n\nbutadiene styrene and a silicone stopper on the other side. The applicator is delivered with an \n\napplication device (sterile injection syringe).  \n\n \n\nThe pre-filled syringe consists of a luer lock, a sealing ring and a cover cap. It is packed in a sterile \n\ntube with a screw-type cap and additionally surrounded by an extra bag. All parts of the pre-filled \n\nsyringe are made of polypropylene, the sealing ring of isoprene. Silicone oil serves as lubricant. The \n\npre-filled syringe is delivered with an application device (indwelling cannula or filter stem).  \n\n \n\nPack sizes \n\n \n\nThe number of primary packaging units delivered depends on the type of the primary packaging unit \n\nand the number of spheroids necessary for the specific defect size (10-70 spheroids/cm\u00b2).  \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nOne applicator has a maximum capacity of 60 spheroids in a volume of up to 200 microlitre isotonic \n\nsodium chloride solution. \n\nOne pre-filled syringe has a maximum capacity of 100 spheroids in a volume of up to 1000 microlitre \n\nisotonic sodium chloride solution. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n \n\nIf the primary or secondary packaging is damaged and therefore unsterile, Spherox should not be \n\napplied.  \n\n \n\nRemaining spheroids must not be stored for later application.  \n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed in accordance with local requirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given with this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n\n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n\n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or physical therapist. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Spherox is and what it is used for  \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Spherox  \n\n3. How to use Spherox  \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Spherox \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Spherox is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nSpherox consists of so-called spheroids. A spheroid looks like a tiny pearl made of cartilage cells and \n\ncartilage material derived from your own body. Cartilage tissue is present in every joint as a hard \n\nsmooth layer on the surface of bone ends. It protects the bones and allows our joints to work smoothly. \n\nTo make the spheroids, a small cartilage sample is taken from part of one of your joints during a minor \n\noperation, and then grown in the laboratory to make the medicine. By surgery the spheroids are \n\nimplanted to the defected cartilage area and stick to the defect site. They are then expected to repair \n\nthe defect with healthy and functional cartilage over time. \n\n \n\nSpherox is used to repair cartilage defects of knee in adults. These defects can be caused by acute \n\ninjury, such as a fall. They can also be caused by repetitive injury, such as long-term incorrect weight \n\nbearing on the joint. Spherox is used to treat defects up to 10 cm\u00b2 in size.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Spherox  \n\n \n\nDo not use Spherox if  \n\n \n\n\u2022 the bones in the joint have not finished growing \n\n\u2022 you have advanced joint and bone inflammation with degeneration in the affected joint \n(osteoarthritis) \n\n\u2022 you are infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), hepatitits B virus or with hepatitis C \nvirus \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor before you are given Spherox, if you have any other joint problems or excess \n\nweight, as this may reduce the success of the procedure. \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nSpherox should preferably be implanted into an otherwise healthy joint. Other joint problems should \n\nbe corrected before or at the time of Spherox implantation.  \n\n \n\nRehabilitation program  \n\n \n\nFollow the rehabilitation program, strictly, after implantation. Only resume physical activity when \n\ninstructed by your doctor. Resuming vigorous activity too soon may reduce the benefit and durability \n\nof Spherox. \n\n \n\nOther cases in which Spherox cannot be supplied \n\n \n\nEven if the cartilage sample has already been taken, it may happen that you cannot be treated with \n\nSpherox. This can occur because the sample taken is not of sufficient quality to manufacture the \n\nproduct. Your doctor might have to select an alternative treatment for you. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nSpherox is not recommended in children or adolescents below 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Spherox \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\n \n\nSpherox is not recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women, as it is applied during surgery. If \n\nyou are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nThe surgical procedure will have a major influence on your ability to drive and use machines. Driving \n\ncars and using machines may be limited during the rehabilitation period. Strictly follow the advice of \n\nyour doctor or physical therapist. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Spherox \n\n \n\nSpherox can only be implanted by a specialist doctor in a medical facility and must only be used in the \n\npatient for whom it has been prepared. \n\n \n\nThe treatment of adults with Spherox is a two-step procedure: \n\n \n\nVisit 1: \n\nEvaluation of the cartilage defect, sample and blood taking \n\n \n\nOn the first visit, the doctor will evaluate your cartilage defect during an exploratory operation. This is \n\nusually done as keyhole surgery through very small incisions (cuts), using a special instrument to look \n\ninside the knee (arthroscopy). \n\nIf Spherox is appropriate for you, the doctor takes a small cartilage sample from your joint. Your \n\ncartilage cells are extracted from this sample in a laboratory and are then grown to make the spheroids \n\nthat constitute Spherox. The process takes about 6 to 8 weeks. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nVisit 2: \n\nSpherox implantation \n\n \n\nSpherox is implanted into the cartilage defect in the joint during the next operation. This may also be \n\ncarried out by keyhole surgery.  \n\n \n\nRehabilitation \n\n \n\nIn order to allow your joint to recover well, you will have to follow an individual rehabilitation \n\nprogram. This may take up to one year. Your doctor or physical therapist will advise you. \n\n \n\nVery important: Carefully comply with the recommendations of your doctor and physical therapist. \n\nThe risk of treatment failure may increase if you do not follow your rehabilitation schedule. \n\nBe very careful when bending and putting weight on your treated joint. During the rehabilitation \n\nperiod, the amount of weight you can put on the joint will increase gradually. How quickly this occurs \n\ndepends for example on your body weight and the size of the cartilage defect. Depending on the \n\ntreated joint, you may have to wear a brace. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or physical therapist if you have any further questions about treatment with Spherox. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Side \n\neffects appearing after the implantation of Spherox are mostly related to the surgery. In general, these \n\nside effects are quite mild and disappear during the weeks following surgery. \n\n \n\nIf you get any of the following serious side effects, you should immediately contact a doctor: \n\n \n\n\u2022 hypersensitivity (allergy) (symptoms: e.g. skin reactions, low blood pressure, constriction of \nairways, swollen tongue or throat, weak and rapid pulse, sickness, vomiting, diarrhoea, \n\ndizziness, fainting, fever) \n\n\u2022 blood clot in a deep vein (symptoms: e.g. swelling, pain, increased warmth in the affected area) \n \n\nOther side effects  \n\n \n\nSide effects can occur with the following frequencies: \n\nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\n\u2022 accumulation of fluid in the joint \n\n\u2022 pain in the joint  \n\n\u2022 swelling in the joint \n \n\nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\n\u2022 cracking sounds in the joint \n\n\u2022 ligament disorder \n\n\u2022 pain \n\n\u2022 tendon inflammation \n\n\u2022 muscle weakness \n\n\u2022 joint lock \n\n\u2022 impairment of walking \n\n\u2022 pain of the front knee or kneecap \n\n\u2022 tissue lump that may occur in the joint \n\n\u2022 swelling due to obstructed flow of tissue fluid via the lymph vessels \n\n\u2022 scar tissue pain \n\n\u2022 accumulation of excess fluid in the bone marrow \n\n\n\n25 \n\n\u2022 inflammation of veins combined with the formation of a blood clot located near the surface of \nthe skin (symptoms: e.g. redness and/or warmth of the skin along the vein, tenderness, pain) \n\n \n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\n\u2022 increase in size of the cartilage cells, softening of cartilage, disorder of bone formation, death of \nbone tissue, bone formation outside the skeleton. You may in that case notice symptoms, for \n\nexample swelling or pain of the tissues around the joint. \n\n\u2022 uneasiness \n\n\u2022 wound-related complication \n\n\u2022 reopening of a closed wound \n\n\u2022 partial or complete detachment of the tissue beneath the bone and surrounding cartilage \n\n\u2022 internal bleedings \n \n\nReporting side effects \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or physical therapist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

exploratory operation. this is usually done as keyhole surgery through very small incisions (cuts), using a special instrument to look inside the knee (arthroscopy). if spherox is appropriate for you, the doctor takes a small cartilage sample from your joint. your cartilage cells are extracted from this sample in a laboratory and are then grown to make the spheroids that constitute spherox. the process takes about 6 to 8 weeks. visit 2: spherox implantation spherox is implanted into the cartilage defect in the joint during the next operation. this may also be carried out by keyhole surgery. rehabilitation in order to allow your joint to recover well, you will have to follow an individual rehabilitation program. this may take up to one year. your doctor or physical therapist will advise you. very important: carefully comply with the recommendations of your doctor and physical therapist. the risk of treatment failure may increase if you do not follow your rehabilitation schedule. be very careful when bending and putting weight on your treated joint. during the rehabilitation period, the amount of weight you can put on the joint will increase gradually. how quickly this occurs depends for example on your body weight and the size of the cartilage defect. depending on the treated joint, you may have to wear a brace. ask your doctor or physical therapist if you have any
