CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nMIRAPEXIN is indicated in adults for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of the disease, \nthrough to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations \nof the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or \u201con off\u201d fluctuations).\n\nMIRAPEXIN is indicated in adults for symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic \nRestless Legs Syndrome in doses up to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) (see section 4.2).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease\n\nThe daily dose is administered in equally divided doses 3 times a day.\n\nInitial treatment\nDoses should be increased gradually from a starting dose of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per \nday and then increased every 5-7 days. Providing patients do not experience intolerable undesirable \neffects, the dose should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.\n\nAscending dose schedule of MIRAPEXIN\nWeek Dose\n\n(mg of base)\nTotal Daily Dose\n(mg of base)\n\nDose\n(mg of salt)\n\nTotal Daily Dose\n(mg of salt)\n\n1 3 x 0.088 0.264 3 x 0.125 0.375\n2 3 x 0.18 0.54 3 x 0.25 0.75\n3 3 x 0.35 1.1 3 x 0.5 1.50\n\nIf a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg \nof salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.\nHowever, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg\n(of salt) per day (see section 4.8).\n\nMaintenance treatment\nThe individual dose of pramipexole should be in the range of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a \nmaximum of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. During dose escalation in pivotal studies, \nefficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt). Further dose \nadjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions. In \nclinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of \nsalt). In advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, pramipexole doses higher than 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) \nper day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended. It is \nrecommended that the dose of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the \nmaintenance treatment with MIRAPEXIN, depending on reactions in individual patients (see section \n4.5).\n\nTreatment discontinuation\nAbrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome or a dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. Pramipexole should be tapered off \nat a rate of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.54 mg \nof base (0.75 mg of salt). Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of \nsalt) per day (see section 4.4). Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome could still appear while \n\n\n\n4\n\ntapering and a temporary increase of the dose could be necessary before resuming tapering (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nRenal impairment\nThe elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. The following dose schedule is \nsuggested for initiation of therapy:\n\nPatients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min require no reduction in daily dose or dosing \nfrequency.\n\nIn patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/min, the initial daily dose of \nMIRAPEXIN should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of \nsalt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/0.25 mg of salt daily). A maximum daily dose of 1.57 mg \npramipexole base (2.25 mg of salt) should not be exceeded.\n\nIn patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/min, the daily dose of MIRAPEXIN should be \nadministered in a single dose, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) daily. A maximum daily \ndose of 1.1 mg pramipexole base (1.5 mg of salt) should not be exceeded.\n\nIf renal function declines during maintenance therapy the MIRAPEXIN daily dose should be reduced \nby the same percentage as the decline in creatinine clearance, i.e. if creatinine clearance declines by \n30%, then the MIRAPEXIN daily dose should be reduced by 30%. The daily dose can be administered \nin two divided doses if creatinine clearance is between 20 and 50 ml/min and as a single daily dose if \ncreatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min.\n\nHepatic impairment\nDose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx. 90% of absorbed \nactive substance is excreted through the kidneys. However, the potential influence of hepatic \ninsufficiency on MIRAPEXIN pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of MIRAPEXIN in children below 18 years has not been established. There is \nno relevant use of MIRAPEXIN in the paediatric population for the indication of Parkinson\u2019s Disease.\n\nRestless Legs Syndrome\n\nThe recommended starting dose of MIRAPEXIN is 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) taken once \ndaily 2-3 hours before bedtime. For patients requiring additional symptomatic relief, the dose may be \nincreased every 4-7 days to a maximum of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day (as shown in the \ntable below).\n\nDose Schedule of MIRAPEXIN\nTitration Step Once Daily Evening Dose\n\n(mg of base)\nOnce Daily Evening Dose\n(mg of salt)\n\n1 0.088 0.125\n2* 0.18 0.25\n3* 0.35 0.50\n4* 0.54 0.75\n* if needed\n\nPatient\u2019s response should be evaluated after 3 months treatment and the need for treatment \ncontinuation should be reconsidered. If treatment is interrupted for more than a few days it should be \nre-initiated by dose titration carried out as above.\n\nTreatment discontinuation\nSince the daily dose for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome will not exceed 0.54 mg of base \n(0.75 mg of salt) MIRAPEXIN can be discontinued without tapering off. In a 26 week placebo \n\n\n\n5\n\ncontrolled trial, rebound of RLS symptoms (worsening of symptom severity as compared to baseline) \nwas observed in 10% of patients (14 out of 135) after abrupt discontinuation of treatment. This effect \nwas found to be similar across all doses.\n\nRenal impairment\nThe elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. Patients with a creatinine clearance \nabove 20 ml/min require no reduction in daily dose.\nThe use of MIRAPEXIN has not been studied in haemodialysis patients, or in patients with severe \nrenal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nDose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is not required, as approx. 90% of absorbed active \nsubstance is excreted through the kidneys.\n\nPaediatric population\nMIRAPEXIN is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of \ndata on safety and efficacy.\n\nTourette Disorder\n\nPaediatric population\nMIRAPEXIN is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years since the \nefficacy and safety has not been established in this population. MIRAPEXIN should not be used in \nchildren or adolescents with Tourette Disorder because of a negative benefit-risk balance for this \ndisorder (see section 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe tablets should be taken orally, swallowed with water, and can be taken either with or without \nfood.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhen prescribing MIRAPEXIN in a patient with Parkinson\u2019s disease with renal impairment a reduced \ndose is suggested in line with section 4.2.\n\nHallucinations\nHallucinations are known as a side effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa. Patients \nshould be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.\n\nDyskinesia\nIn advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesia can occur during \nthe initial titration of MIRAPEXIN. If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.\n\nDystonia\nAxial dystonia including antecollis, camptocormia and pleurothotonus (Pisa Syndrome) has\noccasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease following initiation or incremental\ndose increase of pramipexole. Although dystonia may be a symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease, the\nsymptoms in these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of pramipexole. If dystonia\noccurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and an adjustment in the dose of\npramipexole considered.\n\n\n\n6\n\nSudden onset of sleep and somnolence\nPramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in \npatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without \nawareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly. Patients must be informed of this and \nadvised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with MIRAPEXIN. \nPatients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from \ndriving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of the dose or termination of therapy may be \nconsidered. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking \nother sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.5, 4.7 \nand section 4.8).\n\nImpulse control disorders\nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and \ncarers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including MIRAPEXIN. \nDose reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.\n\nMania and delirium\nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of mania and delirium. Patients and carers \nshould be made aware that mania and delirium can occur in patients treated with pramipexole. Dose \nreduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.\n\nPatients with psychotic disorders\nPatients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential \nbenefits outweigh the risks. Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole \nshould be avoided (see section 4.5).\n\nOphthalmologic monitoring\nOphthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.\n\nSevere cardiovascular disease\nIn case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken. It is recommended to monitor blood \npressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension \nassociated with dopaminergic therapy.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nSymptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal \nof dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2).\n\nDopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS)\nDAWS has been reported with dopamine agonists, including pramipexole (see section 4.8). To \ndiscontinue treatment in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, pramipexole should be tapered off (see \nsection 4.2). Limited data suggests that patients with impulse control disorders and those receiving \nhigh daily dose and/or high cumulative doses of dopamine agonists may be at higher risk for \ndeveloping DAWS. Withdrawal symptoms may include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating \nand pain and do not respond to levodopa. Prior to tapering off and discontinuing pramipexole, patients \nshould be informed about potential withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be closely monitored during \ntapering and discontinuation. In case of severe and/or persistent withdrawal symptoms, temporary re-\nadministration of pramipexole at the lowest effective dose may be considered.\n\nAugmentation\nReports in the literature indicate that treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome with dopaminergic \nmedicinal products can result in augmentation. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms \nin the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other \nextremities. Augmentation was specifically investigated in a controlled clinical trial over 26 weeks. \nAugmentation was observed in 11.8% of patients in the pramipexole group (N = 152) and 9.4% of \n\n\n\n7\n\npatients in the placebo group (N = 149). Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to augmentation showed no \nsignificant difference between pramipexole and placebo groups.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPlasma protein binding\nPramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is \nseen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or \nelimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by \nbiotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with \nanticholinergics has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and \nlevodopa.\n\nInhibitors/competitors of active renal elimination pathway\nCimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by \ninhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules. Therefore, medicinal products \nthat are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as \ncimetidine, amantadine, mexiletine, zidovudine, cisplatin, quinine, and procainamide, may interact \nwith pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of pramipexole. Reduction of the pramipexole dose \nshould be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly with \nMIRAPEXIN.\n\nCombination with levodopa\nWhen MIRAPEXIN is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dose of \nlevodopa is reduced and the dose of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while \nincreasing the dose of MIRAPEXIN.\n\nBecause of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating \nmedicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.4, 4.7 and 4.8).\n\nAntipsychotic medicinal products\nCo-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see \nsection 4.4), e.g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThe effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans. Pramipexole was not \nteratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). \nMIRAPEXIN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAs pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. \nThe excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women. In rats, the \nconcentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma.\nIn the absence of human data, MIRAPEXIN should not be used during breast-feeding. However, if its \nuse is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.\n\nFertility\nNo studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted. In animal studies, pramipexole \naffected oestrous cycles and reduced female fertility as expected for a dopamine agonist. However, \nthese studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to male fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nMIRAPEXIN can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n\n\n8\n\nHallucinations or somnolence can occur.\n\nPatients being treated with MIRAPEXIN and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep \nepisodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness \nmay put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until such \nrecurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,923 patients on \npramipexole and 1,354 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently reported for both \ngroups. 63% of patients on pramipexole and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse \ndrug reaction.\n\nThe majority of adverse drug reactions usually start early in therapy and most tend to disappear even \nas therapy is continued.\n\nWithin the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of \npatients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (\u2265 1/10); \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)..\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease, most common adverse reactions\nThe most commonly (\u2265 5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease more \nfrequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, \ndizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue. The incidence of \nsomnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg pramipexole salt per day (see section 4.2). A \nmore frequent adverse drug reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia. Hypotension may \noccur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.\n\n\n\n9\n\nTable 1: Parkinson\u2019s disease\nBody System Very \n\ncommon\n(\u22651/10)\n\nCommon\n(\u22651/100 to \n\n<1/10)\n\nUncommon\n(\u22651/1,000 to\n\n< 1/100)\n\nRare\n(\u22651/10,000 \n\nto \n<1/1,000)\n\nNot known\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\npneumonia\n\nEndocrine \ndisorders\n\ninappropriate \nantidiuretic\nhormone secretion1\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nInsomnia\nhallucinations\nabnormal dreams \nconfusion \n\nbehavioural \nsymptoms of \nimpulse control \ndisorders and \ncompulsions \n\ncompulsive shopping \npathological \ngambling\nrestlessness\nhypersexuality\ndelusion\nlibido disorder\nparanoia\ndelirium\nbinge eating1\n\nhyperphagia1\n\nmania\n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nsomnolence\ndizziness \ndyskinesia \n\nheadache sudden onset of \nsleep\namnesia\nhyperkinesia\nsyncope\n\nEye disorders visual \nimpairment \nincluding \ndiplopia vision \nblurred \nvisual acuity \nreduced\n\nCardiac \ndisorders\n\ncardiac failure1\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nhypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic, and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nDyspnoea\nhiccups\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nnausea constipation\nvomiting\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nhypersensitivity \npruritus\nrash\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nfatigue\nperipheral \noedema\n\nDopamine \nagonist \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \nincluding \napathy, \nanxiety, \ndepression, \nfatigue, \nsweating \nand pain.\n\n\n\n10\n\nInvestigations weight decrease \nincluding \ndecreased \nappetite\n\nweight increase\n\n1 This side effect has been observed in post-marketing experience.

Nausea and fatigue were more \noften reported in female patients treated with MIRAPEXIN (20.8% and 10.5%, respectively) \ncompared to males (6.7% and 7.3%, respectively).\n\nTable 2: Restless Legs Syndrome\nBody System Very \n\ncommon\n(\u22651/10)\n\nCommon\n(\u22651/100 to \n\n<1/10)\n\nUncommon\n(\u22651/1,000 to\n\n< 1/100)\n\nNot known\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\npneumonia1\n\nEndocrine \ndisorders\n\ninappropriate antidiuretic hormone \nsecretion1\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\ninsomnia\nabnormal \ndreams \n\nrestlessness\nconfusion \nhallucinations\nlibido disorder\ndelusion1\n\nhyperphagia1\n\nparanoia1\n\nmania1\n\ndelirium1\n\nbehavioural symptoms of impulse \ncontrol disorders and compulsions1\n\n(such as:\ncompulsive shopping,\npathological gambling,\nhypersexuality, binge eating)\n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nheadache\ndizziness\nsomnolance\n\nsudden onset of sleep \nsyncope\ndyskinesia\namnesia1\n\nhyperkinesia1\n\nEye disorders visual impairment including \nvisual acuity reduced\ndiplopia \nvision blurred \n\nCardiac \ndisorders\n\ncardiac failure1\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nhypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic, and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\ndyspnoea\nhiccups\n\nGastrointestinal nausea constipation\n\n\n\n11\n\ndisorders vomiting\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nhypersensitivity pruritus\nrash\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nfatigue peripheral oedema Dopamine \nagonist \nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \nincluding \napathy, anxiety, \ndepression, \nfatigue, \nsweating and \npain\n\nInvestigations weight decrease including \ndecreased appetite\nweight increase\n\n1 This side effect has been observed in post-marketing experience. With 95 % certainty, the \nfrequency category is not greater than uncommon, but might be lower. A precise frequency \nestimation is not possible as the side effect did not occur in a clinical trial database of 1,395 \npatients with Restless Legs Syndrome treated with pramipexole\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nSomnolence\nPramipexole is commonly associated with somnolence and has been associated uncommonly with \nexcessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (see also section 4.4).\n\nLibido disorders\nPramipexole may uncommonly be associated with libido disorders (increased or decreased).\n\nImpulse control disorders\nPathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including MIRAPEXIN\n(see section 4.4).\n\nIn a cross-sectional, retrospective screening and case-control study including 3,090 Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease patients, 13.6% of all patients receiving dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic treatment had \nsymptoms of an impulse control disorder during the past six months. Manifestations observed include \npathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge eating, and compulsive sexual behaviour \n(hypersexuality). Possible independent risk factors for impulse control disorders included \ndopaminergic treatments and higher doses of dopaminergic treatment, younger age ( \u2264 65 years), not \nbeing married and self-reported family history of gambling behaviours.\n\nDopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome\nNon-motor adverse effects may occur when tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists including \npramipexole. Symptoms include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating and pain (see section \n4.4).\n\nCardiac failure\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing experience cardiac failure has been reported in patients with \npramipexole. In a pharmacoepidemiological study pramipexole use was associated with an increased \nrisk of cardiac failure compared with non-use of pramipexole (observed risk ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-\n2.85).\n\n\n\n12\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no clinical experience with massive overdose. The expected adverse reactions would be those \nrelated to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, \nhyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension. There is no established antidote for overdose \nof a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent \nmay be indicated. Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with \ngastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of activated charcoal and electrocardiogram \nmonitoring.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-Parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists, ATC code: N04BC05.\n\nMechanism of action\nPramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D2 subfamily \nof dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D3 receptors, and has full intrinsic \nactivity.\n\nPramipexole alleviates parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the \nstriatum. Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and \nturnover.\n\nThe mechanism of action of pramipexole as treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome is unknown. \nNeuropharmacological evidence suggests primary dopaminergic system involvement.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nIn human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed. In a clinical trial with \nhealthy volunteers, where MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets were titrated faster (every 3 days) \nthan recommended up to 3.15 mg pramipexole base (4.5 mg of salt) per day, an increase in blood \npressure and heart rate was observed. Such effect was not observed in patient studies.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety in Parkinson\u2019s disease\nIn patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trials included approximately 1,800 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I \u2013 V treated \nwith pramipexole. Out of these, approximately 1,000 were in more advanced stages, received \nconcomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications.\n\nIn early and advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in controlled clinical trials was \nmaintained for approximately six months. In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years\nthere were no signs of decreasing efficacy. \n\nIn a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole \nsignificantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to \ninitial treatment with levodopa. This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be \nbalanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean \nchange in UPDRS-score). The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally \nhigher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group. However, there was no significant \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13\n\ndifference during the maintenance phase. These points should be considered when initiating \npramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMIRAPEXIN in all subsets of the paediatric population in Parkinson\u2019s Disease (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety in Restless Legs Syndrome\nThe efficacy of pramipexole was evaluated in four placebo-controlled clinical trials in approximately \n1,000 patients with moderate to very severe idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome.\n\nThe mean change from baseline in the Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLS) and the Clinical \nGlobal Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) were the primary efficacy outcome measures. For both \nprimary endpoints statistically significant differences have been observed for the pramipexole dose \ngroups 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 0.75 mg pramipexole salt in comparison to placebo. After 12 weeks of \ntreatment the baseline IRLS score improved from 23.5 to 14.1 points for placebo and from 23.4 to 9.4 \npoints for pramipexole (doses combined). The adjusted mean difference was -4.3 points (CI 95% -6.4; \n-2.1 points, p-value <0.0001). CGI-I responder rates (improved, very much improved) were 51.2% and \n72.0% for placebo and pramipexole, respectively (difference 20% CI 95%: 8.1%; 31.8%, p<0.0005). \nEfficacy was observed with 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) per day after the first week of \ntreatment.\n\nIn a placebo-controlled polysomnography study over 3 weeks MIRAPEXIN significantly reduced the \nnumber of periodic limb movements during time in bed.\n\nLonger term efficacy was evaluated in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. After 26 weeks of treatment, \nthere was an adjusted mean reduction in IRLS total score of 13.7 and 11.1 points in the pramipexole \nand placebo group, respectively, with a statistically significant (p = 0.008) mean treatment difference \nof -2.6. CGI-I responder rates (much improved, very much improved) were 50.3% (80/159) and 68.5% \n(111/162) for placebo and pramipexole, respectively (p = 0.001), corresponding to a number needed to \ntreat (NNT) of 6 patients (95%CI: 3.5, 13.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMIRAPEXIN in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in Restless Legs Syndrome (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety in Tourette Disorder\nThe efficacy of pramipexole (0.0625-0.5 mg/day) with paediatric patients aged 6-17 years with \nTourette Disorder was evaluated in a 6-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled flexible \ndose study. A total of 63 patients were randomised (43 on pramipexole, 20 on placebo). The primary \nendpoint was change from baseline on the Total Tic Score (TTS) of the Yale Global Tic Severity \nScale (YGTSS). No difference was observed for pramipexole as compared to placebo for either the \nprimary endpoint or for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints including YGTSS total score, Patient \nGlobal Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), or \nClinical Global Impressions of Severity of Illness (CGI-S). Adverse events occurring in at least 5% of \npatients in the pramipexole group and more common in the pramipexole-treated patients than in \npatients on placebo were: headache (27.9%, placebo 25.0%), somnolence (7.0%, placebo 5.0%), \nnausea (18.6%, placebo 10.0%), vomiting (11.6%, placebo 0.0%), upper abdominal pain (7.0%, \nplacebo 5.0%), orthostatic hypotension (9.3%, placebo 5.0%), myalgia (9.3%, placebo 5.0%), sleep \ndisorder (7.0%, placebo 0.0%), dyspnoea (7.0%, placebo 0.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection \n(7.0%, placebo 5.0%). Other significant adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication \nfor patients receiving pramipexole were confusional state, speech disorder and aggravated condition \n(see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n14\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nPramipexole is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration. The absolute \nbioavailability is greater than 90% and the maximum plasma concentrations occur between 1 and 3 \nhours. Concomitant administration with food did not reduce the extent of pramipexole absorption, but \nthe rate of absorption was reduced. Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient \nvariation of plasma levels.\n\nDistribution\nIn humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is \nlarge (400 l). High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx. 8-fold compared to \nplasma).\n\nBiotransformation\nPramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent.\n\nElimination\nRenal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination. Approximately 90% of \n14C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces. The total \nclearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/min and the renal clearance is approximately \n400 ml/min. The elimination half-life (t\u00bd) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving \nthe CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated \npharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole.\n\nDecreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the minipig, and a tendency to \na hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey.\n\nThe potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and \nrabbits. Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at \nmaternally toxic doses. Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, \nthe adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated.\n\nA delay in sexual development (i.e., preputial separation and vaginal opening) was observed in rats. \nThe relevance for humans is unknown.\n\nPramipexole was not genotoxic. In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell \nhyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole. This finding is \nnot clinically relevant to man. The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/kg (of salt) and \nhigher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats. The latter finding was not \nobserved in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species \ninvestigated.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nMIRAPEXIN is indicated in adults for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of the disease, \nthrough to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations \nof the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or \u201con off\u201d fluctuations).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nMIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets are a once-a-day oral formulation of pramipexole.\n\nInitial treatment\nDoses should be increased gradually from a starting dose of 0.26 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day \nand then increased every 5-7 days. Providing patients do not experience intolerable undesirable \neffects, the dose should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.\n\nAscending dose schedule of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets\nWeek Daily dose (mg of base) Daily dose (mg of salt)\n1 0.26 0.375\n2 0.52 0.75\n\n\n\n19\n\n3 1.05 1.5\n\nIf a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.52 mg of base (0.75 mg \nof salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.15 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.\nHowever, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than\n1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.8).\n\nPatients already taking MIRAPEXIN tablets may be switched to MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release \ntablets overnight, at the same daily dose. After switching to MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets, \nthe dose may be adjusted depending on the patient\u2019s therapeutic response (see section 5.1).\n\nMaintenance treatment\nThe individual dose of pramipexole should be in the range of 0.26 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a \nmaximum of 3.15 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day. During dose escalation in pivotal studies, \nefficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt). Further dose \nadjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions. In \nclinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of \nsalt). In advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, pramipexole doses higher than 1.05 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt) \nper day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended. It is \nrecommended that the dose of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the\nmaintenance treatment with MIRAPEXIN, depending on reactions in individual patients (see section \n4.5).\n\nMissed dose\nWhen the intake of a dose is missed, MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets should be taken within \n12 hours after the regularly scheduled time. After 12 hours, the missed dose should be left out and the \nnext dose should be taken on the following day at the next regularly scheduled time.\n\nTreatment discontinuation\nAbrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome or a dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. Pramipexole should be tapered off \nat a rate of 0.52 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.52 mg \nof base (0.75 mg of salt). Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.26 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) \nper day (see section 4.4). Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome could still appear while tapering \nand a temporary increase of the dose could be necessary before resuming tapering (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function. The following dose schedule is \nsuggested:\n\nPatients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min require no reduction in daily dose or dosing \nfrequency.\n\nIn patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min, treatment should be started with \n0.26 mg MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets every other day. Caution should be exercised and \ncareful assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability should be made before increasing to daily \ndosing after one week. If a further dose increase is necessary, doses should be increased by 0.26 mg \npramipexole base at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 1.57 mg pramipexole base (2.25 mg of \nsalt) per day.\n\nThe treatment of patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min with MIRAPEXIN prolonged-\nrelease tablets is not recommended as no data are available for this patient population. The use of \nMIRAPEXIN tablets should be considered.\n\nIf renal function declines during maintenance therapy, the recommendations given above should be \nfollowed.\n\n\n\n20\n\nHepatic impairment\nDose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx. 90% of absorbed \nactive substance is excreted through the kidneys. However, the potential influence of hepatic \ninsufficiency on MIRAPEXIN pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of MIRAPEXIN in children below 18 years has not been established. There is \nno relevant use of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets in the paediatric population for the \nindication of Parkinson\u2019s Disease.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe tablets should be swallowed whole with water, and must not be chewed, divided or crushed. The \ntablets may be taken either with or without food and should be taken each day at about the same time.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhen prescribing MIRAPEXIN in a patient with Parkinson\u2019s disease with renal impairment a reduced \ndose is suggested in line with section 4.2.\n\nHallucinations\nHallucinations are known as a side effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa. Patients \nshould be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.\n\nDyskinesia\nIn advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesia can occur during \nthe initial titration of MIRAPEXIN. If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.\n\nDystonia\nAxial dystonia including antecollis, camptocormia and pleurothotonus (Pisa Syndrome) has\noccasionally been reported in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease following initiation or incremental\ndose increase of pramipexole. Although dystonia may be a symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease, the\nsymptoms in these patients have improved after reduction or withdrawal of pramipexole. If dystonia\noccurs, the dopaminergic medication regimen should be reviewed and an adjustment in the dose of\npramipexole considered.\n\nSudden onset of sleep and somnolence\nPramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in \npatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without \nawareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly. Patients must be informed of this and \nadvised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with MIRAPEXIN. \nPatients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from \ndriving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of the dose or termination of therapy may be \nconsidered. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking \nother sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.5, 4.7 \nand section 4.8).\n\nImpulse control disorders\nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and \ncarers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including MIRAPEXIN. \nDose reduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.\n\n\n\n21\n\nMania and delirium\nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of mania and delirium. Patients and carers\nshould be made aware that mania and delirium can occur in patients treated with pramipexole. Dose \nreduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop.\n\nPatients with psychotic disorders\nPatients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential \nbenefits outweigh the risks. Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole \nshould be avoided (see section 4.5).\n\nOphthalmologic monitoring\nOphthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.\n\nSevere cardiovascular disease\nIn case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken. It is recommended to monitor blood \npressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension \nassociated with dopaminergic therapy.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nSymptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal \nof dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2).\n\nDopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS)\nDAWS has been reported with dopamine agonists, including pramipexole (see section 4.8). To \ndiscontinue treatment in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, pramipexole should be tapered off (see \nsection 4.2). Limited data suggests that patients with impulse control disorders and those receiving \nhigh daily dose and/or high cumulative doses of dopamine agonists may be at higher risk for \ndeveloping DAWS. Withdrawal symptoms may include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating \nand pain and do not respond to levodopa. Prior to tapering off and discontinuing pramipexole, patients \nshould be informed about potential withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be closely monitored during \ntapering and discontinuation. In case of severe and/or persistent withdrawal symptoms, temporary re-\nadministration of pramipexole at the lowest effective dose may be considered.\n\nRemnants in stool \nSome patients have reported the occurrence of remnants in faeces which may resemble intact \nMIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets. If patients report such an observation, the physician should \nreassess patient\u2019s response to therapy.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPlasma protein binding\nPramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is \nseen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or \nelimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by \nbiotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with \nanticholinergics has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and \nlevodopa.\n\nInhibitors/competitors of active renal elimination pathway\nCimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by \ninhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules. Therefore, medicinal products \nthat are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as \ncimetidine, amantadine, mexiletine, zidovudine, cisplatin, quinine, and procainamide, may interact \nwith pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of pramipexole. Reduction of the pramipexole dose \nshould be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly with \nMIRAPEXIN.\n\n\n\n22\n\nCombination with levodopa\nWhen MIRAPEXIN is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dose of \nlevodopa is reduced and the dose of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while \nincreasing the dose of MIRAPEXIN.\n\nBecause of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating \nmedicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see sections 4.4, 4.7 and 4.8).\n\nAntipsychotic medicinal products\nCo-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see \nsection 4.4), e.g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThe effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans. Pramipexole was not \nteratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3). \nMIRAPEXIN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAs pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. \nThe excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women. In rats, the \nconcentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma.\nIn the absence of human data, MIRAPEXIN should not be used during breast-feeding. However, if its \nuse is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.\n\nFertility\nNo studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted. In animal studies, pramipexole \naffected oestrous cycles and reduced female fertility as expected for a dopamine agonist. However, \nthese studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to male fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nMIRAPEXIN can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nHallucinations or somnolence can occur.\n\nPatients being treated with MIRAPEXIN and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep \nepisodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness \nmay put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until such \nrecurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,778 Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease patients on pramipexole and 1,297 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently \nreported for both groups. 67% of patients on pramipexole and 54% of patients on placebo reported at \nleast one adverse drug reaction.\n\nThe majority of adverse drug reactions usually start early in therapy and most tend to disappear even \nas therapy is continued.\n\nWithin the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of \npatients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (\u2265 1/10); \n\n\n\n23\n\ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very \nrare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)..\n\nThe most commonly (\u2265 5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease more \nfrequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, \ndizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue. The incidence of \nsomnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg pramipexole salt per day (see section 4.2). A \nmore frequent adverse drug reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia. Hypotension may \noccur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.\n\nBody System Very \ncommon\n(\u22651/10)\n\nCommon\n(\u22651/100 to \n\n<1/10)\n\nUncommon\n(\u22651/1,000 to\n\n< 1/100)\n\nRare\n(\u22651/10,000 \n\nto \n<1/1,000)\n\nNot known\n\nInfections and \ninfestations\n\npneumonia\n\nEndocrine \ndisorders\n\ninappropriate \nantidiuretic\nhormone secretion1\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nInsomnia\nhallucinations\nabnormal dreams \nconfusion \n\nbehavioural \nsymptoms of \nimpulse control \ndisorders and \ncompulsions \n\ncompulsive shopping \npathological \ngambling\nrestlessness\nhypersexuality\ndelusion\nlibido disorder\nparanoia\ndelirium\nbinge eating1\n\nhyperphagia1\n\nmania\n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders\n\nsomnolence\ndizziness \ndyskinesia \n\nheadache sudden onset of \nsleep\namnesia\nhyperkinesia\nsyncope\n\nEye disorders visual \nimpairment \nincluding \ndiplopia vision \nblurred \nvisual acuity \nreduced\n\nCardiac \ndisorders\n\ncardiac failure1\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nhypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic, and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nDyspnoea\nhiccups\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nnausea constipation\nvomiting\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nhypersensitivity \npruritus\nrash\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \n\nfatigue\nperipheral \n\nDopamine \nagonist \n\n\n\n24\n\nadministration \nsite conditions\n\noedema withdrawal \nsyndrome \nincluding \napathy, \nanxiety, \ndepression, \nfatigue, \nsweating \nand pain.\n\nInvestigations weight decrease \nincluding \ndecreased \nappetite\n\nweight increase\n\n1 This side effect has been observed in post-marketing experience. With 95 % certainty, the \nfrequency category is not greater than uncommon, but might be lower. A precise frequency \nestimation is not possible as the side effect did not occur in a clinical trial database of 2,762 \npatients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease treated with pramipexole.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nSomnolence\nPramipexole is commonly associated with somnolence and has been associated uncommonly with \nexcessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (see also section 4.4).\n\nLibido disorders\nPramipexole may uncommonly be associated with libido disorders (increased or decreased).\n\nImpulse control disorders\nPathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists including MIRAPEXIN\n(see section 4.4).\n\nIn a cross-sectional, retrospective screening and case-control study including 3,090 Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease patients, 13.6% of all patients receiving dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic treatment had \nsymptoms of an impulse control disorder during the past six months. Manifestations observed include \npathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge eating, and compulsive sexual behaviour \n(hypersexuality). Possible independent risk factors for impulse control disorders included \ndopaminergic treatments and higher doses of dopaminergic treatment, younger age ( \u2264 65 years), not \nbeing married and self-reported family history of gambling behaviours.\n\nDopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome\nNon-motor adverse effects may occur when tapering or discontinuing dopamine agonists including \npramipexole. Symptoms include apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sweating and pain (see section \n4.4).\n\nCardiac failure\nIn clinical studies and post-marketing experience cardiac failure has been reported in patients with \npramipexole. In a pharmacoepidemiological study pramipexole use was associated with an increased \nrisk of cardiac failure compared with non-use of pramipexole (observed risk ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-\n2.85).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no clinical experience with massive overdose. The expected adverse reactions would be those \nrelated to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, \nhyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension. There is no established antidote for overdose \nof a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent \nmay be indicated. Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with \ngastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of activated charcoal and electrocardiogram \nmonitoring.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-Parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists, ATC code: N04BC05.\n\nMechanism of action\nPramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D2 subfamily \nof dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D3 receptors, and has full intrinsic \nactivity.\n\nPramipexole alleviates parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the \nstriatum. Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and \nturnover.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nIn human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed. In a clinical trial with \nhealthy volunteers, where MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets were titrated faster (every 3 days) \nthan recommended up to 3.15 mg pramipexole base (4.5 mg of salt) per day, an increase in blood \npressure and heart rate was observed. Such effect was not observed in patient studies.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety in Parkinson\u2019s disease\nIn patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Placebo-\ncontrolled clinical trials included approximately 1,800 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I \u2013 V treated \nwith pramipexole. Out of these, approximately 1,000 were in more advanced stages, received \nconcomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications.\n\nIn early and advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in controlled clinical trials was \nmaintained for approximately six months. In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years \nthere were no signs of decreasing efficacy. \n\nIn a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole \nsignificantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to \ninitial treatment with levodopa. This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be \nbalanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean \nchange in UPDRS-score). The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally \nhigher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group. However, there was no significant \ndifference during the maintenance phase. These points should be considered when initiating \npramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets in the treatment of Parkinson's \ndisease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of three randomised, \ncontrolled trials. Two trials were conducted in patients with early Parkinson's disease and one trial was \nconducted in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n\n26\n\nSuperiority of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets over placebo was demonstrated after 18 weeks \nof treatment on both the primary (UPDRS Parts II+III score) and the key secondary (CGI-I and PGI-I \nresponder rates) efficacy endpoints in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial including a total of 539 \npatients with early Parkinson\u2019s disease. Maintenance of efficacy was shown in patients treated for \n33 weeks. MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets were non-inferior to pramipexole immediate release \ntablets as assessed on the UPDRS Parts II+III score at week 33.\n\nIn a double-blind placebo-controlled trial including a total of 517 patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease who were on concomitant levodopa therapy superiority of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release \ntablets over placebo was demonstrated after 18 weeks of treatment on both the primary (UPDRS Parts \nII+III score) and the key secondary (off-time) efficacy endpoints.\n\nThe efficacy and tolerability of an overnight switch from MIRAPEXIN tablets to MIRAPEXIN\nprolonged-release tablets at the same daily dose were evaluated in a double-blind clinical study in \npatients with early Parkinson\u2019s disease. \nEfficacy was maintained in 87 of 103 patients switched to MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets. \nOut of these 87 patients, 82.8% did not change their dose, 13.8% increased and 3.4% decreased their \ndose.\nIn half of the 16 patients who did not meet the criterion for maintained efficacy on UPDRS Part II+III \nscore, the change from baseline was considered not clinically relevant.\nOnly one patient switched to MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets experienced a drug-related \nadverse event leading to withdrawal.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMIRAPEXIN in all subsets of the paediatric population in Parkinson\u2019s Disease (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nPramipexole is completely absorbed following oral administration. The absolute bioavailability is \ngreater than 90%.\n\nIn a Phase I trial, where pramipexole immediate release and prolonged-release tablets were assessed in \nfasted state, the minimum and peak plasma concentration (Cmin, Cmax) and exposure (AUC) of the same \ndaily dose of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets given once daily and MIRAPEXIN tablets given \nthree times a day were equivalent.\n\nThe once daily administration of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets causes less frequent \nfluctuations in the pramipexole plasma concentration over 24 hours compared to the three times daily \nadministration of pramipexole immediate release tablets.\n\nThe maximum plasma concentrations occur at about 6 hours after administration of MIRAPEXIN\nprolonged-release tablets once daily. Steady state of exposure is reached at the latest after 5 days of \ncontinuous dosing.\n\nConcomitant administration with food does generally not affect the bioavailability of pramipexole. \nIntake of a high fat meal induced an increase in peak concentration (Cmax) of about 24% after a single \ndose administration and about 20% after multiple dose administrations and a delay of about 2 hours in \ntime to reach peak concentration in healthy volunteers. Total exposure (AUC) was not affected by \nconcomitant food intake. The increase in Cmax is not considered clinically relevant. In the Phase III \nstudies that established safety and efficacy of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets, patients were \ninstructed to take study medication without regard to food intake.\n\nWhile body weight has no impact on the AUC, it was found to influence the volume of distribution \nand therefore the peak concentrations Cmax. A decreased body weight by 30 kg results in an increase in \n\n\n\n27\n\nCmax of 45%. However, in Phase III trials in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients no clinically meaningful \ninfluence of body weight on the therapeutic effect and tolerability of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release \ntablets was detected.\n\nPramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient variation of plasma levels.\n\nDistribution\nIn humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is \nlarge (400 l). High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx. 8-fold compared to \nplasma).\n\nBiotransformation\nPramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent.\n\nElimination\nRenal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination. Approximately 90% of \n14C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces. The total \nclearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/min and the renal clearance is approximately \n400 ml/min. The elimination half-life (t\u00bd) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving \nthe CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated \npharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole.\n\nDecreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the minipig, and a tendency to \na hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey.\n\nThe potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and \nrabbits. Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at \nmaternally toxic doses. Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, \nthe adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated.\n\nA delay in sexual development (i.e., preputial separation and vaginal opening) was observed in rats. \nThe relevance for humans is unknown.\n\nPramipexole was not genotoxic. In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell \nhyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole. This finding is \nnot clinically relevant to man. The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/kg (of salt) and \nhigher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats. The latter finding was not \nobserved in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species \ninvestigated.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What MIRAPEXIN is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take MIRAPEXIN\n3. How to take MIRAPEXIN\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store MIRAPEXIN\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What MIRAPEXIN is and what it is used for\n\nMIRAPEXIN contains the active substance pramipexole and belongs to a group of medicines known \nas dopamine agonists, which stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain. Stimulation of the dopamine \nreceptors triggers nerve impulses in the brain that help to control body movements.\n\nMIRAPEXIN is used to:\n- treat the symptoms of primary Parkinson\u2019s disease in adults. It can be used alone or in \n\ncombination with levodopa (another medicine for Parkinson\u2019s disease).\n- treat the symptoms of moderate to severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome in adults.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take MIRAPEXIN\n\nDo not take MIRAPEXIN:\n- if you are allergic to pramipexole or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in\n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before taking MIRAPEXIN. Tell your doctor if you have (had) or develop any \nmedical conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following:\n- Kidney disease\n- Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). Most hallucinations are visual.\n- Dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs). If you have advanced \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the up-\ntitration of MIRAPEXIN.\n\n- Dystonia (inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia)). In \nparticular, you may experience forward flexion of the head and neck (also called antecollis), \nforward bending of the lower back (also called camptocormia) or sidewards bending of the back \n(also called pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome).\n\n- Sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep\n\n\n\n69\n\n- Psychosis (e.g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia)\n- Vision impairment. You should have regular eye examinations during treatment with \n\nMIRAPEXIN.\n- Severe heart or blood vessels disease. You will need to have your blood pressure checked \n\nregularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. This is to avoid postural hypotension (a fall in \nblood pressure on standing up).\n\n- Augmentation. You may experience that symptoms start earlier than usual, be more intense and \ninvolve other limbs.\n\nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to \nbehave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry \nout certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders and \ncan include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high \nsex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to \nadjust or stop your dose.\n\nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing mania (agitation, feeling \nelated or over-excited) or delirium (decreased awareness, confusion or loss of reality). Your doctor \nmay need to adjust or stop your dose.\n\nTell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or \npain after stopping or reducing your MIRAPEXIN treatment. If the problems persist more than a few \nweeks, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment.\n\nTell your doctor if you are developing an inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright \n(axial dystonia). If this happens, your doctor may want to adjust or change your medication.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nMIRAPEXIN is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and MIRAPEXIN\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have \nobtained without a prescription.\n\nYou should avoid taking MIRAPEXIN together with antipsychotic medicines.\n\nTake care if you are taking the following medicines:\n- cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers)\n- amantadine (which can be used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease)\n- mexiletine (to treat irregular heartbeats, a condition known as ventricular arrhythmia)\n- zidovudine (which can be used to treat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a \n\ndisease of the human immune system)\n- cisplatin (to treat various types of cancers)\n- quinine (which can be used for the prevention of painful night-time leg cramps and for the \n\ntreatment of a type of malaria known as falciparum malaria (malignant malaria))\n- procainamide (to treat irregular heart beat)\n\nIf you are taking levodopa, the dose of levodopa is recommended to be reduced when you start \ntreatment with MIRAPEXIN.\n\nTake care if you are using any medicines that calm you down (have a sedative effect) or if you are \ndrinking alcohol. In these cases MIRAPEXIN may affect your ability to drive and operate machinery.\n\nMIRAPEXIN with food, drink and alcohol\nYou should be cautious while drinking alcohol during treatment with MIRAPEXIN.\nMIRAPEXIN can be taken with or without food.\n\n\n\n70\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then discuss with you if you \nshould continue to take MIRAPEXIN.\n\nThe effect of MIRAPEXIN on the unborn child is not known. Therefore, do not take MIRAPEXIN if \nyou are pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\nMIRAPEXIN should not be used during breast-feeding. MIRAPEXIN can reduce the production of \nbreast milk. Also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby. If use of MIRAPEXIN is \nunavoidable, breast-feeding should be stopped.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nMIRAPEXIN can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). If affected, \ndo not drive or use machines.\n\nMIRAPEXIN has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, particularly \nin patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. If you experience these side effects, you must not drive or operate \nmachinery. You should tell your doctor if this occurs.\n\n3.

What MIRAPEXIN is and what it is used for\n\nMIRAPEXIN contains the active substance pramipexole and belongs to a group of medicines known \nas dopamine agonists, which stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain. Stimulation of the dopamine \nreceptors triggers nerve impulses in the brain that help to control body movements.\n\nMIRAPEXIN is used to treat the symptoms of primary Parkinson\u2019s disease in adults. It can be used \nalone or in combination with levodopa (another medicine for Parkinson\u2019s disease).\n\n2. What you need to know before you take MIRAPEXIN\n\nDo not take MIRAPEXIN:\n- if you are allergic to pramipexole or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before taking MIRAPEXIN. Tell your doctor if you have (had) or develop any \nmedical conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following:\n- Kidney disease\n- Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). Most hallucinations are visual.\n- Dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs). If you have advanced \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the up-\ntitration of MIRAPEXIN.\n\n- Dystonia (inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia)). In \nparticular, you may experience forward flexion of the head and neck (also called antecollis), \nforward bending of the lower back (also called camptocormia) or sidewards bending of the back \n(also called pleurothotonus or Pisa Syndrome).\n\n\n\n79\n\n- Sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep\n- Psychosis (e.g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia)\n- Vision impairment. You should have regular eye examinations during treatment with \n\nMIRAPEXIN.\n- Severe heart or blood vessels disease. You will need to have your blood pressure checked \n\nregularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. This is to avoid postural hypotension (a fall in \nblood pressure on standing up).\n\nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to \nbehave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry \nout certain activities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders and \ncan include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high \nsex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to \nadjust or stop your dose.\n\nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing mania (agitation, feeling \nelated or over-excited) or delirium (decreased awareness, confusion, loss of reality). Your doctor may \nneed to adjust or stop your dose.\n\nTell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or \npain after stopping or reducing your MIRAPEXIN treatment. If the problems persist more than a few \nweeks, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment.\n\nTell your doctor if you are developing an inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright \n(axial dystonia). If this happens, your doctor may want to adjust or change your medication.\n\nMIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets is a specially designed tablet from which the active ingredient \nis gradually released, once the tablet has been ingested. Parts of tablets may occasionally be passed \nand seen in the stool (faeces) and may look like whole tablets. Inform your doctor if you find tablet \npieces in your faeces.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nMIRAPEXIN is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and MIRAPEXIN\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have \nobtained without a prescription.\n\nYou should avoid taking MIRAPEXIN together with antipsychotic medicines.\n\nTake care if you are taking the following medicines:\n- cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers)\n- amantadine (which can be used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease)\n- mexiletine (to treat irregular heartbeats, a condition known as ventricular arrhythmia)\n- zidovudine (which can be used to treat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a \n\ndisease of the human immune system)\n- cisplatin (to treat various types of cancers)\n- quinine (which can be used for the prevention of painful night-time leg cramps and for the \n\ntreatment of a type of malaria known as falciparum malaria (malignant malaria))\n- procainamide (to treat irregular heart beat)\n\nIf you are taking levodopa, the dose of levodopa is recommended to be reduced when you start \ntreatment with MIRAPEXIN.\n\nTake care if you are using any medicines that calm you down (have a sedative effect) or if you are \ndrinking alcohol. In these cases MIRAPEXIN may affect your ability to drive and operate machinery.\n\n\n\n80\n\nMIRAPEXIN with food, drink and alcohol\nYou should be cautious while drinking alcohol during treatment with MIRAPEXIN.\nMIRAPEXIN can be taken with or without food.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will then discuss with you if you \nshould continue to take MIRAPEXIN.\n\nThe effect of MIRAPEXIN on the unborn child is not known. Therefore, do not take MIRAPEXIN if \nyou are pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\nMIRAPEXIN should not be used during breast-feeding. MIRAPEXIN can reduce the production of \nbreast milk. Also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby. If use of MIRAPEXIN is \nunavoidable, breast-feeding should be stopped.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nMIRAPEXIN can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). If affected, \ndo not drive or use machines.\n\nMIRAPEXIN has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, particularly \nin patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. If you experience these side effects, you must not drive or operate \nmachinery. You should tell your doctor if this occurs.\n\n3.

Swallow the tablets whole with water. \n\nDo not chew, divide or crush the prolonged-\nrelease tablets. If you do, there is a danger you \ncould overdose, because the medicine may be \nreleased into your body too quickly.\n\nDuring the first week, the usual daily dose is 0.26 mg pramipexole. The dose will be increased every \n5-7 days as directed by your doctor until your symptoms are controlled (maintenance dose).\n\nAscending dose schedule of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets\nWeek Daily dose (mg) Number of tablets\n1 0.26 One MIRAPEXIN 0.26 mg prolonged-release tablet.\n2 0.52 One MIRAPEXIN 0.52 mg prolonged-release tablet,\n\nOR\ntwo MIRAPEXIN 0.26 mg prolonged-release tablets.\n\n3 1.05 One MIRAPEXIN 1.05 mg prolonged-release tablet,\nOR\n\n\n\n81\n\ntwo MIRAPEXIN 0.52 mg prolonged-release tablets,\nOR\nfour MIRAPEXIN 0.26 mg prolonged-release tablets.\n\nThe usual maintenance dose is 1.05 mg per day. However, your dose may have to be increased even \nfurther. If necessary, your doctor may increase your dose up to a maximum of 3.15 mg of pramipexole \na day. A lower maintenance dose of one MIRAPEXIN 0.26 mg prolonged-release tablet a day is also \npossible.\n\nPatients with kidney disease\nIf you have kidney disease, your doctor may advise you to take the usual starting dose of 0.26 mg \nprolonged-release tablets only every other day for the first week. After that, your doctor may increase \nthe dosing frequency to one 0.26 mg prolonged-release tablet every day. If a further dose increase is \nnecessary, your doctor may adjust it in steps of 0.26 mg pramipexole.\n\nIf you have serious kidney problems, your doctor may need to switch you to a different pramipexole \nmedicine. If during treatment your kidney problems get worse, you should contact your doctor as soon \nas possible.\n\nIf you are switching from MIRAPEXIN (immediate release) tablets\nYour doctor will base your dose of MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets on the dose of \nMIRAPEXIN (immediate release) tablets you were taking.\n\nTake your MIRAPEXIN (immediate release) tablets as normal the day before you switch. Then take \nyour MIRAPEXIN prolonged-release tablets next morning and do not take any more MIRAPEXIN\n(immediate release) tablets.\n\nIf you take more MIRAPEXIN than you should\nIf you accidentally take too many tablets,\n- Contact your doctor or nearest hospital casualty department immediately for advice.\n- You may experience vomiting, restlessness, or any of the side effects as described in section 4 \n\n\u201cPossible side effects\u201d.\n\nIf you forget to take MIRAPEXIN\nIf you forget to take a dose of MIRAPEXIN, but remember within 12 hours of your usual time, take \nyour tablet straightaway and then take your next tablet at the usual time.\nIf you forget for more than 12 hours, simply take the next single dose at the usual time. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten tablet dose.\n\nIf you stop taking MIRAPEXIN\nDo not stop taking MIRAPEXIN without first talking to your doctor. If you have to stop taking this \nmedicine, your doctor will reduce the dose gradually. This reduces the risk of worsening symptoms.\n\nIf you suffer from Parkinson\u2019s disease you should not stop treatment with MIRAPEXIN abruptly. A \nsudden stop could cause you to develop a medical condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome \nwhich may represent a major health risk. The symptoms include:\n- akinesia (loss of muscle movement)\n- rigid muscles\n- fever\n- unstable blood pressure\n- tachycardia (increased heart rate)\n- confusion\n- depressed level of consciousness (e.g. coma)\n\nIf you stop or reduce MIRAPEXIN you may also develop a medical condition called dopamine \nagonist withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms include depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or \npain. If you experience these symptoms you should contact your physician.\n\n\n\n82\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Evaluation \nof these side effects is based on the following frequencies:\n\nVery common may affect more than 1 in 10 people\nCommon may affect up to 1 in 10 people\nUncommon may affect up to 1 in 100 people\nRare may affect up to1 in 1,000 people\nVery rare may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people\nNot known Frequency cannot be estimated from the available data\n\nYou may experience the following side effects:\n\nVery common:\n- Dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs)\n- Sleepiness \n- Dizziness\n- Nausea (sickness)\n\nCommon:\n- Urge to behave in an unusual way\n- Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there)\n- Confusion\n- Tiredness (fatigue)\n- Sleeplessness (insomnia)\n- Excess of fluid, usually in the legs (peripheral oedema)\n- Headache\n- Hypotension (low blood pressure)\n- Abnormal dreams\n- Constipation\n- Visual impairment\n- Vomiting (being sick)\n- Weight loss including decreased appetite\n\nUncommon:\n- Paranoia (e.g. excessive fear for one\u2019s own well-being)\n- Delusion\n- Excessive daytime sleepiness and suddenly falling asleep\n- Amnesia (memory disturbance)\n- Hyperkinesia (increased movements and inability to keep still)\n- Weight increase\n- Allergic reactions (e.g. rash, itching, hypersensitivity)\n- Fainting\n- Cardiac failure (heart problems which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling)*\n- Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion*\n- Restlessness\n- Dyspnoea (difficulties to breathe)\n- Hiccups\n- Pneumonia (infection of the lungs)\n- Inability to resist the impulse, drive or temptation to perform an action that could be harmful to \n\nyou or others, which may include:\n- Strong impulse to gamble excessively despite serious personal or family consequences.\n\n\n\n83\n\n- Altered or increased sexual interest and behaviour of significant concern to you or to others, \nfor example, an increased sexual drive.\n\n- Uncontrollable excessive shopping or spending\n- Binge eating (eating large amounts of food in a short time period) or compulsive eating \n\n(eating more food than normal and more than is needed to satisfy your hunger)*\n- Delirium (decreased awareness, confusion, loss of reality)\n\nRare:\n- Mania (agitation, feeling elated or over-excited)\n\nNot known:\n- After stopping or reducing your MIRAPEXIN treatment: Depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, \n\nsweating or pain may occur (called dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome or DAWS).\n\nTell your doctor if you experience any of these behaviors; he will discuss ways of managing or \nreducing the symptoms.\n\nFor the side effects marked with * a precise frequency estimation is not possible, since these side \neffects were not observed in clinical studies among 2,762 patients treated with pramipexole. The \nfrequency category is probably not greater than \u201cuncommon\u201d.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Presence of impulse control \ndisorders (ICD) has been consistently linked to DAWS in six retrospective chart reviews and one \nprospective observational study. High daily dose and high cumulative doses of dopamine agonists \n(DA) has been inconsistently linked to DAWS. Regardless of the inconsistency, the evidence points to \nan association between DAWS and high daily dose and/or cumulative doses of dopamine agonists. \nBased on these findings it is considered relevant to include the risk factors ICD, high daily dose and/or \ncumulative doses of dopamine agonists (DA) in the product information section 4.4.\n\nDAWS has predominantly been reported in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), although there are \nreports of it occurring among patients with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The wording about \ndiscontinuing pramipexole should therefore not be limited to the PD indication. In consequence \n\u2018tapering\u2019 should be supplemented by \u2018discontinuing\u2019 in section 4.4 regarding DAWS, to make the \nwording also applicable for the RLS indication (tapering is not required in the RLS indication).\n\nAs DAWS symptoms occur upon dopamine agonist tapering/discontinuation, it is vital to distinguish \nbetween undermedication of the underlying medical disorder and DAWS. If the DAWS symptoms are \nmistakenly attributed to PD the clinician might increase the dose of levodopa, however this will not \nalleviate the DAWS symptoms. As combination therapy with DA and levodopa are often used, it is \nconsidered relevant for healthcare professionals to be informed that withdrawal symptoms do not \nrespond to increasing of the levodopa dose, to aid in the differential diagnosis.\n\nFurther, updates of SmPC section 4.2 and PIL section 3 to include information regarding treatment \ndiscontinuation and DAWS, are considered relevant.\n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.\n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)\n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for pramipexole the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pramipexole is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information.\n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.\tMANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tC.\tOTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION\n\tD.\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\tA.

before taking mirapexin. tell your doctor if you have (had) or develop any medical conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following: - kidney disease - hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). most hallucinations are visual. - dyskinesia (e.g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs). if you have advanced parkinson's disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the up- titration of mirapexin. - dystonia (inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia)). in particular, you may experience forward flexion of the head and neck (also called antecollis), forward bending of the lower back (also called camptocormia) or sidewards bending of the back (also called pleurothotonus or pisa syndrome). - sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep 69 - psychosis (e.g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia) - vision impairment. you should have regular eye examinations during treatment with mirapexin. - severe heart or blood vessels disease. you will need to have your blood pressure checked regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment. this is to avoid postural hypotension (a fall in blood pressure on standing up). - augmentation. you may experience that symptoms start earlier than usual, be more intense and involve other limbs. tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to behave in ways that are unusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain activities that could harm yourself or others. these are called impulse control disorders and can include behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. your doctor may need to adjust or stop your dose. tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing mania (agitation, feeling elated or over-excited) or delirium (decreased awareness, confusion or loss of reality). your doctor may need to adjust or stop your dose. tell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sweating or pain after stopping or reducing your mirapexin treatment. if the problems persist more than a few weeks, your doctor may need to adjust your treatment. tell your doctor if you are developing an inability of keeping your body and neck straight and upright (axial dystonia). if this happens, your doctor may want to adjust or change your medication. children and adolescents mirapexin is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years. other medicines and mirapexin tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. this includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have obtained without a prescription. you should avoid taking mirapexin together with antipsychotic medicines. take care if you are taking the following medicines: - cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers) - amantadine (which can be used to treat parkinson's disease) - mexiletine (to treat irregular heartbeats, a condition known as ventricular arrhythmia) - zidovudine (which can be used to treat the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids), a disease of the human immune system) - cisplatin (to treat various types of cancers) - quinine (which can be used for the prevention of painful night-time leg cramps and for the treatment of a type of malaria known as falciparum malaria (malignant malaria)) - procainamide (to treat irregular heart beat) if you are taking levodopa, the dose of levodopa is recommended to be reduced when you start treatment with mirapexin. take care if you are using any medicines that calm you down (have a sedative effect) or if you are drinking alcohol. in these cases mirapexin may affect your ability to drive and operate machinery. mirapexin with food, drink and alcohol you should be cautious while drinking alcohol during treatment with mirapexin. mirapexin can be taken with or without food. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. your doctor will then discuss with you if you should continue to take mirapexin. the effect of mirapexin on the unborn child is not known. therefore, do not take mirapexin if you are pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so. mirapexin should not be used during breast-feeding. mirapexin can reduce the production of breast milk. also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby. if use of mirapexin is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be stopped. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. driving and using machines mirapexin can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there). if affected, do not drive or use machines. mirapexin has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, particularly in patients with parkinson's disease. if you experience these side effects, you must not drive or operate machinery. you should tell your doctor if this occurs.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
