CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of adult and paediatric (in any age range) patients with confirmed diagnosis of hereditary \n\ntyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nNitisinone treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of \n\nHT-1 patients.  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\nTreatment of all genotypes of the disease should be initiated as early as possible to increase overall \n\nsurvival and avoid complications such as liver failure, liver cancer and renal disease. Adjunct to the \n\nnitisinone treatment, a diet deficient in phenylalanine and tyrosine is required and should be followed \n\nby monitoring of plasma amino acids (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\nThe recommended initial daily dose in the paediatric and adult population is 1 mg/kg body weight \n\nadministered orally. The dose of nitisinone should be adjusted individually. It is recommended to \n\nadminister the dose once daily. However, due to the limited data in patients with body weight <20 kg, \n\nit is recommended to divide the total daily dose into two daily administrations in this patient \n\npopulation. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment  \n\nDuring regular monitoring, it is appropriate to follow urine succinylacetone, liver function test values \n\nand alpha-fetoprotein levels (see section 4.4). If urine succinylacetone is still detectable one month \n\nafter the start of nitisinone treatment, the nitisinone dose should be increased to \n\n1.5 mg/kg body weight/day. A dose of 2 mg/kg body weight/day may be needed based on the \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nevaluation of all biochemical parameters. This dose should be considered as a maximal dose for all \n\npatients.  \n\n \n\nIf the biochemical response is satisfactory, the dose should be adjusted only according to body weight \n\ngain.  \n\n \n\nHowever, in addition to the tests above, during the initiation of therapy, switch from twice daily to \n\nonce daily dosing or if there is a deterioration, it may be necessary to follow more closely all available \n\nbiochemical parameters (i.e. plasma succinylacetone, urine 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) and erythrocyte \n\nporphobilinogen (PBG)-synthase activity). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\nThere are no specific dose recommendations for elderly or patients that have renal or hepatic \n\nimpairment.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe dose recommendation in mg/kg body weight is the same in children and adults. \n\nHowever, due to the limited data in patients with body weight <20 kg, it is recommended to divide the \n\ntotal daily dose into two daily administrations in this patient population. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nThe capsule may be opened and the content suspended in a small amount of water or formula diet \n\nimmediately before intake. \n\n \n\nOther pharmaceutical forms are available for paediatric patients who have difficulties swallowing \n\ncapsules. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that if nitisinone treatment is initiated with food, this should be maintained on a \n\nroutine basis, see section 4.5. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nMothers receiving nitisinone must not breast-feed (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nMonitoring of plasma tyrosine levels  \n\nIt is recommended that a slit-lamp examination of the eyes is performed before initiation of nitisinone \n\ntreatment and thereafter regularly, at least once a year. A patient displaying visual disorders during \n\ntreatment with nitisinone should without delay be examined by an ophthalmologist. It should be \n\nestablished that the patient is adhering to his/her dietary regimen and the plasma tyrosine \n\nconcentration should be measured. A more restricted tyrosine and phenylalanine diet should be \n\nimplemented in case the plasma tyrosine level is above 500 micromol/L. It is not recommended to \n\nlower the plasma tyrosine concentration by reduction or discontinuation of nitisinone, since the \n\nmetabolic defect may result in deterioration of the patient’s clinical condition.  \n\n \n\nLiver monitoring  \n\nThe liver function should be monitored regularly by liver function tests and liver imaging. It is \n\nrecommended to also monitor serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations. Increase in serum \n\nalpha-fetoprotein concentration may be a sign of inadequate treatment. Patients with increasing \n\nalpha-fetoprotein or signs of nodules in the liver should always be evaluated for hepatic malignancy.  \n\n \n\nPlatelet and white blood cell (WBC) monitoring  \n\nIt is recommended that platelet and WBC counts are monitored regularly, as a few cases of reversible \n\nthrombocytopenia and leucopenia were observed during clinical evaluation.  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nMonitoring visits should be performed every 6 months; shorter intervals between visits are \n\nrecommended in case of adverse events. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with other medicinal products  \n\nNitisinone is a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor. Nitisinone treatment may therefore result in increased \n\nplasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products metabolized primarily via CYP2C9. \n\nNitisinone treated patients who are concomitantly treated with medicinal products with a narrow \n\ntherapeutic window metabolized through CYP2C9, such as warfarin and phenytoin, should be \n\ncarefully monitored. Dose-adjustment of these co-administered medicinal products may be needed \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNitisinone is metabolised in vitro by CYP 3A4 and dose-adjustment may therefore be needed when \n\nnitisinone is co-administered with inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme. \n\n \n\n \n\nBased on data from a clinical interaction study with 80 mg nitisinone at steady-state, nitisinone is a \n\nmoderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (2.3-fold increase in tolbutamide AUC), therefore nitisinone treatment \n\nmay result in increased plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products metabolized \n\nprimarily via CYP2C9 (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNitisinone is a weak inducer of CYP2E1 (30% decrease in chlorzoxazone AUC) and a weak inhibitor \n\nof OAT1 and OAT3 (1.7-fold increase in AUC of furosemide), whereas nitisinone did not inhibit \n\nCYP2D6 (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nNo formal food interactions studies have been performed with Nitisinone MDK hard capsules. \n\nHowever, nitisinone has been co-administered with food during the generation of efficacy and safety \n\ndata. Therefore, it is recommended that if nitisinone treatment with Nitisinone MDK hard capsules is \n\ninitiated with food, this should be maintained on a routine basis, see section 4.2. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of nitisinone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nNitisinone MDK should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman \n\nrequires treatment with nitisinone.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\nIt is unknown whether nitisinone is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \n\nadverse postnatal effects via exposure of nitisinone in milk. Therefore, mothers receiving nitisinone \n\nmust not breast-feed, since a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded (see sections 4.3 and 5.3).  \n\n \n\nFertility  \n\nThere are no data on nitisinone affecting fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNitisinone has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions involving \n\nthe eyes (see section 4.8) can affect the vision. If the vision is affected the patient should not drive or \n\nuse machines until the event has subsided. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nBy its mode of action, nitisinone increases tyrosine levels in all nitisinone treated patients. Eye-related \n\nadverse reactions, such as conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, keratitis, photophobia, and eye pain, related \n\nto elevated tyrosine levels are therefore common. Other common adverse reactions include \n\nthrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and granulocytopenia. Exfoliative dermatitis may occur uncommonly. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n\nThe adverse reactions listed below by MedDRA system organ class and absolute frequency, are based \n\non data from a clinical trial and post-marketing use. Frequency is defined as very common (≥1/10), \n\ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA system organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders  \n\nCommon Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, \n\ngranulocytopenia \n\nUncommon Leukocytosis  \n\nEye disorders  Common Conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, \n\nkeratitis, photophobia, eye pain  \n\nUncommon Blepharitis  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders  \n\nUncommon Exfoliative dermatitis, \n\nerythematous rash, pruritus  \n\nInvestigations  Very common Elevated tyrosine levels \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n\nNitisinone treatment leads to elevated tyrosine levels. Elevated levels of tyrosine have been associated \n\nwith eye-related adverse reactions, such as e.g. corneal opacities and hyperkeratotic lesions. \n\nRestriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the diet should limit the toxicity associated with this type \n\nof tyrosinemia by lowering tyrosine levels (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, granulocytopenia was only uncommonly severe (<0.5x109/L) and not associated \n\nwith infections. Adverse reactions affecting the MedDRA system organ class ‘Blood and lymphatic \n\nsystem disorders’ subsided during continued nitisinone treatment.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe safety profile is mainly based on the paediatric population since nitisinone treatment should be \n\nstarted as soon as the diagnosis of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) has been established. From \n\nclinical study and post marketing data there are no indications that the safety profile is different in \n\ndifferent subsets of the paediatric population or different from the safety profile in adult patients.  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nAccidental ingestion of nitisinone by individuals eating normal diets not restricted in tyrosine and \n\nphenylalanine will result in elevated tyrosine levels. Elevated tyrosine levels have been associated \n\nwith toxicity to eyes, skin, and the nervous system. Restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the \n\ndiet should limit toxicity associated with this type of tyrosinemia. No information about specific \n\ntreatment of overdose is available. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, Various alimentary tract \n\nand metabolism products, ATC code: A16A X04. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThe biochemical defect in hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) is a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate \n\nhydrolase, which is the final enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway. Nitisinone is a competitive \n\ninhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme which precedes fumarylacetoacetate \n\nhydrolase in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in \n\npatients with HT-1, nitisinone prevents the accumulation of the toxic intermediates maleylacetoacetate \n\nand fumarylacetoacetate. In patients with HT1, these intermediates are converted to the toxic \n\nmetabolites succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate. Succinylacetone inhibits the porphyrin \n\nsynthesis pathway leading to the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinate.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nNitisinone treatment leads to normalised porphyrin metabolism with normal erythrocyte \n\nporphobilinogen synthase activity and urine 5-aminolevulinate, decreased urinary excretion of \n\nsuccinylacetone, increased plasma tyrosine concentration and increased urinary excretion of phenolic \n\nacids. Available data from a clinical study indicates that in more than 90% of the patients urine \n\nsuccinylacetone was normalized during the first week of treatment. Succinylacetone should not be \n\ndetectable in urine or plasma when the nitisinone dose is properly adjusted. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe clinical study was open-labelled and uncontrolled. The dosing frequency in the study was twice \n\ndaily. Survival probabilities after 2, 4 and 6 years of treatment with nitisinone are summarized in the \n\ntable below. \n\n \n\nNTBC study (N=250) \n\nAge at start of treatment 2 years 4 years 6 years \n\n≤ 2 months 93% 93% 93% \n\n≤ 6 months 93% 93% 93% \n\n> 6 months 96% 95% 95% \n\nOverall 94% 94% 94% \n\n \n\nData from a study used as a historical control (van Spronsen et al., 1994) showed the following \n\nsurvival probability. \n\n \n\nAge at onset of symptoms 1 year 2 years \n\n< 2 months 38% 29% \n\n2 – 6 months 74% 74% \n\n> 6 months 96% 96% \n\n \n\nTreatment with nitisinone was also found to result in reduced risk for the development of \n\nhepatocellular carcinoma compared to historical data on treatment with dietary restriction alone. It was \n\nfound that the early initiation of treatment resulted in a further reduced risk for the development of \n\nhepatocellular carcinoma. \n\n \n\nThe 2-, 4-, and 6-year probability of no occurrence of HCC during nitisinone treatment for patients \n\naged 24 months or younger at the start of treatment and for those older than 24 months at the start of \n\ntreatment is shown in the following table: \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\nNTBC study (N=250) \n\n Number of patients at Probability of no HCC (95% \n\nconfidence interval) at \n\nStart 2 years 4 years 6 years 2 years 4 years 6 years \n\nAll patients 250 155 86 15 98% \n\n(95; 100) \n\n94% \n\n(90; 98) \n\n91% \n\n(81; 100) \n\nStart age \n\n≤ 24 months \n\n193 114 61 8 99% \n\n(98; 100) \n\n99% \n\n(97; 100) \n\n99% \n\n(94; 100) \n\nStart age \n\n> 24 months \n\n57 41 25 8 92% \n\n(84; 100) \n\n82% \n\n(70; 95) \n\n75% \n\n(56; 95) \n\n \n\nIn an international survey of patients with HT-1 on treatment with dietary restriction alone, it was \n\nfound that HCC had been diagnosed in 18% of all patients aged 2 years and above. \n\n \n\nA study to evaluate the PK, efficacy and safety of once daily dosing compared to twice daily dosing \n\nwas performed in 19 patients with HT-1. There were no clinically important differences in AEs or \n\nother safety assessments between once and twice daily dosing. No patient had detectable \n\nsuccinylacetone (SA) levels at the end of the once-daily treatment period. The study indicates that \n\nonce daily administration is safe and efficacious across all ages of patients. Data is, however, limited \n\nin patients with body weight <20 kg. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nFormal absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination studies have not been performed with \n\nnitisinone. In 10 healthy male volunteers, after administration of a single dose of nitisinone capsules \n\n(1 mg/kg body weight) the terminal half-life (median) of nitisinone in plasma was 54 hours (ranging \n\nfrom 39 to 86 hours). Population pharmacokinetic analysis has been conducted on a group of 207 \nHT-1 patients. The clearance and half-life were determined to be 0.0956 l/kg body weight/day and \n\n52.1 hours respectively.  \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed P450 enzymes have shown \n\nlimited CYP 3A4-mediated metabolism. \n\n \n\nBased on data from a clinical interaction study with 80 mg nitisinone at steady-state, nitisinone caused \n\na 2.3-fold increase in AUC of the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide, which is indicative of a moderate \n\ninhibition of CYP2C9. Nitisinone caused an approximate 30% decrease in chlorzoxazone AUC, \n\nindicative of a weak induction of CYP2E1. Nitisinone does not inhibit CYP2D6 since metoprolol \n\nAUC was not affected by the administration of nitisinone. Furosemide AUC was increased 1.7-fold, \n\nindicating a weak inhibition of OAT1/OAT3 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro studies, nitisinone is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, 2C19 or 3A4-mediated \n\nmetabolism or to induce CYP1A2, 2B6 or 3A4/5. Nitisinone is not expected to inhibit P-gp, BCRP or \n\nOCT2-mediated transport. Nitisinone plasma concentration reached in clinical setting is not expected \n\nto inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3 mediated transport. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNitisinone has shown embryo-foetal toxicity in the mouse and rabbit at clinically relevant dose levels. \n\nIn the rabbit, nitisinone induced a dose-related increase in malformations (umbilical hernia and \n\ngastroschisis) from a dose level 2.5-fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose \n\n(2 mg/kg/day). \n\n \n\nA pre- and postnatal development study in the mouse showed statistically significant reduced pup \n\nsurvival and pup growth during the weaning period at dose levels 125- and 25-fold higher, \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nrespectively, the maximum recommended human dose, with a trend toward a negative effect on pup \n\nsurvival starting from the dose of 5 mg/kg/day. In rats, exposure via milk resulted in reduced mean \n\npup weight and corneal lesions.  \n\n \n\nNo mutagenic but a weak clastogenic activity was observed in in vitro studies. There was no evidence \n\nof in vivo genotoxicity (mouse micronucleus assay and mouse liver unscheduled DNA synthesis \n\nassay).  Nitisinone did not show carcinogenic potential in a 26-week carcinogenicity study in \n\ntransgenic mice (TgrasH2). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Nitisinone MDK is and what it is used for  \n\n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Nitisinone MDK is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThe active ingredient of Nitisinone MDK is nitisinone. This medicine is used for treatment of a rare \n\ndisease called hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 in adults, adolescents and children (in any age range).  \n\n \n\nIn this disease your body is unable to completely break down the amino acid tyrosine (amino acids are \n\nbuilding blocks of our proteins), forming harmful substances. These substances are accumulated in \n\nyour body. Nitisinone MDK blocks the breakdown of tyrosine and the harmful substances are not \n\nformed.  \n\n \n\nYou must follow a special diet while you are taking this medicine, because tyrosine will remain in \n\nyour body. This special diet is based on low tyrosine and phenylalanine (another amino acid) content. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Nitisinone MDK  \n\n \n\nDo not take Nitisinone MDK: \n\n- if you are allergic to nitisinone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\nDo not breast-feed while taking this medicine, see section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Nitisinone MDK. \n\n \n\n- Your eyes will be checked by an ophthalmologist before and regularly during nitisinone \n\ntreatment. If you get red eyes or any other signs of effects on the eyes, contact your doctor \n\nimmediately for an eye examination. Eye problems could be a sign of inadequate dietary control \n\n(see section 4).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nDuring the treatment, blood samples will be drawn in order for your doctor to check whether the \n\ntreatment is adequate and to make sure that there are no possible side effects causing blood disorders.  \n\nYour liver will be checked at regular intervals because the disease affects the liver.  \n\n \n\nFollow-up by your doctor should be performed every 6 months. If you experience any side effects, \n\nshorter intervals are recommended. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Nitisinone MDK \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nNitisinone MDK may interfere with the effect of other medicines, such as: \n\n- Medicines for epilepsy (such as phenytoin) \n\n- Medicines against blood clotting (such as warfarin) \n\n \n\nNitisinone MDK with food and drink \n\nIf you start Nitisinone MDK treatment by taking it with food, it is recommended that you carry on \n\ntaking it with food throughout your course of treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nThe safety of this medicine has not been studied in pregnant and breast-feeding women. Please contact \n\nyour doctor if you plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant you should contact your doctor \n\nimmediately.  \n\n \n\nDo not breast-feed while taking this medicine, see section “Do not take Nitisinone MDK”. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis medicine has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, if you \n\nexperience side effects affecting your vision you should not drive or use machines until your vision is \n\nback to normal (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Nitisinone MDK \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure.  \n\n \n\nTreatment with this medicine should be started and supervised by a doctor experienced in the \n\ntreatment of the disease (hereditary tyrosinemia type 1).  \n\n \n\nThe recommended total daily dose is 1 mg/kg body weight administered orally. Your doctor will \n\nadjust the dose individually. It is recommended to administer the dose once daily. However, due to the \n\nlimited data in patients with body weight <20 kg, it is recommended to divide the total daily dose into \n\ntwo daily administrations in this patient population. \n\n \n\nIf you have problems with swallowing the capsules, you may open the capsule and mix the powder \n\nwith a small amount of water or formula diet just before you take it. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Nitisinone MDK than you should \n\nIf you have taken more of this medicine than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Nitisinone MDK \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you forget to take a dose, contact your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Nitisinone MDK \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nIf you have the impression that the medicine is not working properly, talk to your doctor. Do not \n\nchange the dose or stop the treatment without talking to your doctor.  \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nIf you notice any side effects relating to the eyes, talk to your doctor immediately to have an eye \n\nexamination. Treatment with nitisinone leads to higher levels of tyrosine in the blood which can cause \n\neye related symptoms. Common eye related side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) caused \n\nby higher tyrosine levels are inflammation in the eye (conjunctivitis), opacity and inflammation in the \n\ncornea (keratitis), sensitivity to light (photophobia) and eye pain. Inflammation of the eyelid \n\n(blepharitis) is an uncommon side effect (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n\n \n\nOther common side effects  \n\n- Reduced number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) and white blood cells (leukopenia), shortage of \ncertain white blood cells (granulocytopenia).  \n\n \n\nOther uncommon side effects  \n\n- increased number of white blood cells (leucocytosis),  \n\n- itching (pruritus), skin inflammation (exfoliative dermatitis), rash.  \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Nitisinone MDK \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the bottle after “EXP”. \n\nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Store in the original bottle in order to protect from light. \n\nThe medicine can be stored for a period of 2 months, after first opening the bottle, at a temperature not \n\nabove 25°C, after which it must be discarded. \n\n \n\nDo not forget to mark the date on the bottle, when removed from the refrigerator. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.
