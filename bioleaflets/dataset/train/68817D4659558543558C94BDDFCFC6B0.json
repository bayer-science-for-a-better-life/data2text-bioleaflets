This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nMYLOTARG 5 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach vial of powder for concentrate for solution for infusion contains 5 mg gemtuzumab ozogamicin.\n\nAfter reconstitution (see section 6.6), the concentrated solution contains 1 mg/mL gemtuzumab ozogamicin.\n\nGemtuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the CD33-directed monoclonal \nantibody (hP67.6; recombinant humanised immunoglobulin [Ig] G4, kappa antibody produced by \nmammalian cell culture in NS0 cells) that is covalently linked to the cytotoxic agent \nN-acetyl gamma calicheamicin.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate).\n\nWhite to off-white cake or powder.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nMYLOTARG is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the \ntreatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive acute \nmyeloid leukaemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nMYLOTARG should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately \navailable.\n\nMYLOTARG should be used only in patients eligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy.\n\nPremedication with a corticosteroid, antihistamine, and acetaminophen (or paracetamol) is recommended \n1 hour prior to dosing to help ameliorate infusion-related symptoms (see section 4.4).\n\nAppropriate measures to help prevent the development of tumour lysis-related hyperuricaemia, such as \nhydration, administration of antihyperuricemic or other agents for treatment of hyperuricaemia should be \ntaken (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n3\n\nPosology\n\nInduction \n\nThe recommended dose of MYLOTARG is 3 mg/m2/dose (up to a maximum of one 5 mg vial) infused over \na 2-hour period on Days 1, 4, and 7 in combination with DNR 60 mg/m2/day infused over 30 minutes on \nDay 1 to Day 3, and AraC 200 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion on Day 1 to Day 7.\n\nIf a second induction is required, MYLOTARG should not be administered during second induction therapy.\nOnly DNR and AraC should be administered during the second induction cycle, at the following\nrecommended dosing: DNR 35 mg/m2/day on Days 1 and 2, and AraC 1 g/m2 every 12 hours, on Day 1 to \nDay 3.\n\nConsolidation \n\nFor patients experiencing a complete remission (CR) following induction, defined as fewer than 5% blasts in \na normocellular marrow and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of more than 1.0 \u00d7 109 cells/L with a \nplatelet count of 100 \u00d7 109/L or more in the peripheral blood in the absence of transfusion, up to 2 \nconsolidation courses of intravenous DNR (60 mg/m2 for 1 day [first course] or 2 days [second course]) in \ncombination with intravenous AraC (1 g/m2 per 12 hours, infused over 2 hours on Day 1 to Day 4) with \nintravenous MYLOTARG (3 mg/m2/dose infused over 2 hours up to a maximum dose of one 5 mg vial on \nDay 1) are recommended.\n\nTable 1.

See Table 3 and Table 4 for dose modification information.\nb. For patients experiencing a complete remission (CR) following induction.\n\n\n\n4\n\nDose and schedule modifications\n\nSchedule modification for hyperleukocytosis\n\nIn patients with hyperleukocytic (leukocyte count \u2265 30,000/mm3) AML, cytoreduction is recommended \neither with leukapheresis, oral hydroxyurea or AraC with or without hydroxyurea to reduce the peripheral \nwhite blood cell (WBC) count 48 hours prior to administration of MYLOTARG. \n\nIf AraC is used for leukoreduction with or without hydroxyurea in patients with previously untreated, \nde novo hyperleukocytic AML receiving MYLOTARG in combination therapy, apply the following \nmodified schedule (Table 2):\n\nTable 2. Schedule modification for the treatment of hyperleukocytosis with cytarabine\n\nTreatment \ncourse\n\nMYLOTARG daunorubicin cytarabine hydroxyurea\n\nInductiona\n\n3 mg/m2/dose (up to a \nmaximum of one 5 mg\nvial) on Days 3, 6, and 9\n\n60 mg/m2/day on \nDay 3 to Day 5\n\n200 mg/m2/day on \nDay 1 to Day 7\n\nDay 1 (as per \nstandard medical \npractice)\n\nSee Table 1 for dose recommendations for consolidation course.\na. See Table 3 and Table 4 for additional dose modification information.\n\nDose modification for adverse reactions\n\nDose modification of MYLOTARG is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability (see \nsection 4.4). Management of some adverse reactions may require dose interruptions or permanent \ndiscontinuation of MYLOTARG (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nTables 3 and 4 show the dose modification guidelines for haematological and non-haematological toxicities, \nrespectively.\n\nTable 3.

Patients should be monitored until \nsigns and symptoms completely resolve and infusion may resume. \nConsider permanent discontinuation of treatment for severe or \nlife-threatening infusion reactions (see section 4.4).\n\nOther severe or life-threatening \nnon-haematologic toxicities\n\nDelay treatment with MYLOTARG until recovery to a severity of no \nmore than mild.  \nConsider omitting scheduled dose if delayed more than 2 days \nbetween sequential infusions.\n\nAbbreviations: ALT=alanine aminotransferase; AST=aspartate aminotransferase; SOS=sinusoidal obstruction\nsyndrome; ULN=upper limit of normal; VOD=venoocclusive disease.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nUse in patients with hepatic impairment\n\nNo adjustment of the starting dose is required in patients with hepatic impairment defined by total bilirubin \n\u2264 2 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \n\u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN. Postpone MYLOTARG until recovery of total bilirubin to \u2264 2 \u00d7 ULN and AST and ALT to \n\u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN prior to each dose (see Table 4, sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nUse in patients with renal impairment\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. MYLOTARG has not \nbeen studied in patients with severe renal impairment. MYLOTARG does not undergo renal clearance, the \npharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment is unknown (see section 5.2).\n\nElderly patients\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of MYLOTARG in patients less than 15 years of age has not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nMYLOTARG is for intravenous use and must be reconstituted and diluted before administration (see \nsection 6.6). When reconstituted to a 1 mg/mL concentration, the extractable content of one vial is 4.5 mg \n(4.5 mL). The reconstituted and diluted solution should be administered intravenously by infusion over a \n\n\n\n6\n\n2-hour period under close clinical monitoring, including pulse, blood pressure, and temperature. \nMYLOTARG should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus (see section 6.6).\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nHepatotoxicity, including hepatic venoocclusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS)\n\nHepatotoxicity, including life-threatening, and sometimes fatal hepatic failure and VOD/SOS have been \nreported in patients treated with MYLOTARG (see section 4.8).\n\nBased on an analysis of potential risk factors, adult patients who received MYLOTARG as monotherapy, \neither before or after an haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), and patients with moderate or severe \nhepatic impairment are at increased risk for developing VOD (see section 4.8).\n\nDue to the risk of VOD/SOS, signs and symptoms of VOD/SOS should be closely monitored; these may \ninclude elevations in ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, which should be monitored prior \nto each dose of MYLOTARG, hepatomegaly (which may be painful), rapid weight gain, and ascites. \nMonitoring only total bilirubin may not identify all patients at risk of VOD/SOS. For patients who develop \nabnormal liver tests, more frequent monitoring of liver tests and clinical signs and symptoms of \nhepatotoxicity is recommended. For patients who proceed to HSCT, close monitoring of liver tests is \nrecommended during the post-HSCT period, as appropriate. No definitive relationship was found between \nVOD and time of HSCT relative to higher MYLOTARG monotherapy doses, however, the ALFA-0701 \nstudy recommended an interval of 2 months between the last dose of MYLOTARG and HSCT.\n\nManagement of signs or symptoms of hepatic toxicity may require a dose interruption, or discontinuation of \nMYLOTARG (see section 4.2). In patients who experience VOD/SOS, MYLOTARG should be \ndiscontinued and patients treated according to standard medical practice.\n\nInfusion related reactions (including anaphylaxis)\n\nIn clinical studies infusion related reactions, including anaphylaxis were reported (see section 4.8). There \nhave been reports of fatal infusion reactions in the post-marketing setting. Signs and symptoms of infusion \nrelated reactions may include fever and chills, and less frequently hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory \nsymptoms that may occur during the first 24 hours after administration. Infusion of MYLOTARG should be \nperformed under close clinical monitoring, including pulse, blood pressure, and temperature. Premedication \nwith a corticosteroid, antihistamine and acetaminophen (or paracetamol) is recommended 1 hour prior to \nMYLOTARG dosing (see section 4.2). Infusion should be interrupted immediately for patients who develop \nevidence of severe reactions, especially dyspnoea, bronchospasm, or clinically significant hypotension. \nPatients should be monitored until signs and symptoms completely resolve. Discontinuation of treatment \nshould be strongly considered for patients who develop signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, including severe \nrespiratory symptoms or clinically significant hypotension (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n7\n\nMyelosuppression\n\nIn clinical studies, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, lymphopenia, \nand pancytopenia, some of which were life-threatening or fatal, were reported (see section 4.8).\nComplications associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may include infections and \nbleeding/haemorrhagic reactions respectively. Infections and bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions were reported, \nsome of which were life-threatening or fatal.\n\nComplete blood counts should be monitored prior to each dose of MYLOTARG. During treatment, patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, bleeding/haemorrhage, or other effects of \nmyelosuppression. Routine clinical and laboratory surveillance testing during and after treatment is \nindicated.\n\nManagement of patients with severe infection, bleeding/haemorrhage, or other effects of myelosuppression, \nincluding severe neutropenia or persistent thrombocytopenia, may require a dose delay or permanent \ndiscontinuation of MYLOTARG (see section 4.2).\n\nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS)\n\nIn clinical studies, TLS was reported (see section 4.8). Fatal reports of TLS complicated by acute renal \nfailure have been reported in the post-marketing setting. In patients with hyperleukocytic AML, \nleukoreduction should be considered with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis to reduce the peripheral WBC count \nto below 30,000/mm3 prior to administration of MYLOTARG to reduce the risk of inducing TLS (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of TLS and treated according to standard medical \npractice. Appropriate measures to help prevent the development of tumour lysis-related hyperuricaemia, such \nas hydration, administration of antihyperuricemics (e.g., allopurinol) or other agents for treatment of \nhyperuricaemia (e.g., rasburicase) must be taken.\n\nAML with adverse-risk cytogenetics\n\nThe efficacy of MYLOTARG has been shown in AML patients with favourable- and intermediate-risk \ncytogenetics, with uncertainty regarding the size of the effect in patients with adverse cytogenetics (see \nsection 5.1). For patients being treated with MYLOTARG in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine \nfor newly diagnosed de novo AML, when cytogenetics testing results become available it should be \nconsidered whether the potential benefit of continuing treatment with MYLOTARG outweighs the risks for \nthe individual patient (see section 5.1).\n\nContraception\n\nWomen of childbearing potential, or partners of females of childbearing potential should be advised to use \n2 methods of effective contraception during treatment with MYLOTARG for at least 7 months (females) or \n4 months (males) after the last dose (see section 4.6).\n\nExcipients\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nThis medicinal product may be further prepared for administration with sodium-containing solutions (see \nsections 4.2 and 6.6) and this should be considered in relation to the total sodium from all sources that will \nbe administered to the patient.\n\n\n\n8\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted with MYLOTARG. See section 5.2 for available \ndata from in vitro studies.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \nMYLOTARG.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential, or partners of females of childbearing potential should be advised to use \n2 methods of effective contraception during treatment with MYLOTARG for at least 7 months (females) or \n4 months (males) after the last dose.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in pregnant women. Studies \nin animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nMYLOTARG must not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the \npotential risks to the foetus. Pregnant women, or patients becoming pregnant whilst receiving gemtuzumab \nozogamicin, or treated male patients as partners of pregnant women, must be apprised of the potential hazard \nto the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nThere is no information regarding the presence of gemtuzumab ozogamicin or its metabolites in human milk, \nthe effects on the breast-fed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for adverse \nreactions in breast-fed children, women should not breast-feed during treatment with MYLOTARG and for \nat least 1 month after the final dose (see section 5.3).\n\nFertility\n\nThere is no information on fertility in patients. Based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility may \nbe compromised by treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (see section 5.3). Both men and women should \nseek advice on fertility preservation before treatment.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nMYLOTARG has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised \nthey may experience fatigue, dizziness and headache during treatment with MYLOTARG (see section 4.8). \nTherefore, caution should be exercised when driving or operating machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe overall safety profile of MYLOTARG is based on data from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia from \nthe combination therapy study ALFA-0701, monotherapy studies, and from post-marketing experience. In \nthe combination therapy study, safety data consisting of selected treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) \nconsidered most important for understanding the safety profile of MYLOTARG consisted of all grades \nhaemorrhages, all grades VOD, and severe infections. All of these TEAEs were determined to be adverse \ndrug reactions. Because of this limited data collection, laboratory data from the combination therapy study\nare included in Table 5. Information about adverse drug reactions from monotherapy studies and \npost-marketing experience is presented Table 6 in order to provide full characterisation of adverse reactions.\n\n\n\n9\n\nIn the combination therapy study ALFA-0701, clinically relevant serious adverse reactions were \nhepatotoxicity, including VOD/SOS (3.8%), haemorrhage (9.9%), severe infection (41.2%), and tumour lysis \nsyndrome (1.5%). In monotherapy studies, clinically relevant serious adverse reactions also included \ninfusion related reactions (2.5%), thrombocytopenia (21.7%), and neutropenia (34.3%). \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (> 30%) in the combination therapy study were haemorrhage and \ninfection. In monotherapy studies the most common adverse reactions (> 30%) included pyrexia, nausea, \ninfection, chills, haemorrhage, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, headache, stomatitis, diarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, and neutropenia.\n\nThe most frequent (\u2265 1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in the combination therapy \nstudy were thrombocytopenia, VOD, haemorrhage and infection. The most frequent (\u2265 1%) adverse reactions \nthat led to permanent discontinuation in monotherapy studies were infection, haemorrhage, multi-organ \nfailure, and VOD.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe adverse reactions are presented by system organ class (SOC) and frequency categories, defined using the \nfollowing convention: very common (\uf0b3 1/10), common (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100), rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.\n\n\n\n10\n\nTable 5.

Additional\ncharacterisation of hepatotoxicity adverse reactions is provided from the monotherapy studies.\n\nIn the combination therapy study (N=131), VOD was reported in 6 (4.6%) patients during or following \ntreatment, 2 (1.5%) of these reactions were fatal (see Table 5). Five (3.8%) of these VOD reactions occurred \nwithin 28 days of any dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. One VOD event occurred more than 28 days of last \ndose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin; with 1 of these events occurring a few days after having started an HSCT \nconditioning regimen. The median time from the last gemtuzumab ozogamicin dose to onset of VOD was \n9 days (range: 2-298 days). VOD was also reported in 2 patients who received MYLOTARG as a follow-up \ntherapy following relapse of AML after chemotherapy treatment in the control arm of the combination \ntherapy study. Both of these patients experienced VOD more than 28 days after the last dose of gemtuzumab \nozogamicin. One of these patients experienced VOD 25 days after the subsequent HSCT.\n\nBased on an analysis of potential risk factors, adult patients who received MYLOTARG as monotherapy, \npatients who had received an HSCT prior to gemtuzumab ozogamicin exposure were 2.6 times more likely \n(95% CI: 1.448, 4.769) to develop VOD compared to patients without HSCT prior to treatment with \ngemtuzumab ozogamicin; patients who had received an HSCT following treatment with gemtuzumab \nozogamicin were 2.9 times more likely (95% CI: 1.502, 5.636) to develop VOD compared to patients \nwithout HSCT following treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin; and patients who had moderate/severe \nhepatic impairment at baseline were 8.7 times more likely (95% CI: 1.879, 39.862) to develop VOD \ncompared to patients without moderate/severe hepatic impairment at baseline.\n\nPatients should be monitored for hepatotoxicity as recommended in section 4.4. Management of signs or \nsymptoms of hepatic toxicity may require a dose interruption, or discontinuation of MYLOTARG (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nMyelosuppression\n\nIn the combination therapy study in patients with previously untreated de novo AML treated with \nfractionated doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy, Grade 3/4 decreases in \nleukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets were observed in 131 (100%), 124 (96.1%), and 131 (100%) patients, \nrespectively.\n\nDuring the induction phase, 109 (83.2%) and 99 (75.6%) patients had platelet recovery to counts of \n50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3, respectively. The median times to platelet recovery to counts of 50,000/mm3\n\nand 100,000/mm3 were 34 and 35 days, respectively. During the consolidation 1 phase, 92 (94.8%) and \n71 (73.2%) patients had a platelet recovery to counts of 50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3, respectively. The \n\n\n\n14\n\nmedian times to platelet recovery to counts of 50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3 were 32 and 35 days, \nrespectively. During the consolidation 2 phase, 80 (97.6%) and 70 (85.4%) patients had a platelet recovery to \ncounts of 50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3, respectively. The median times to platelet recovery to counts of \n50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3 were 36.5 and 43 days, respectively.\n\nThrombocytopenia with platelet counts < 50,000/mm3 persisting 45 days after the start of therapy for \nresponding patients (CR and incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) occurred in 22 (20.4%) of patients. The \nnumber of patients with persistent thrombocytopenia remained similar across treatment courses \n(8 [7.4%] patients at the induction phase and 8 [8.5%] patients at the consolidation 1 phase and \n10 [13.2%] patients at the consolidation 2 phase).\n\nDuring the induction phase, 121 (92.4%) and 118 (90.1%) patients had a documented neutrophil recovery to \nANC of 500/mm3 and 1,000/mm3, respectively. The median time to neutrophil recovery to ANC of 500/mm3\n\nand 1,000/mm3 was 25 days. In the consolidation 1 phase of therapy, 94 (96.9%) patients had neutrophil \nrecovery to counts of 500/mm3, and 91 (94%) patients recovered to counts of 1,000/mm3. The median times \nto neutrophil recovery to ANC of 500/mm3 and 1,000/mm3 were 21 and 25 days, respectively. In the \nconsolidation 2 phase of therapy, 80 (97.6%) patients had neutrophil recovery to counts of 500/mm3, and \n79 (96.3%) patients recovered to counts of 1,000/mm3. The median times to neutrophil recovery to ANC of \n500/mm3 and 1,000/mm3 were 22 and 27 days, respectively.\n\nIn the combination therapy study, in patients with de novo AML treated with fractionated doses of \ngemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy (N=131), 102 (77.9%) patients experienced all \ncausality severe (Grade \u2265 3) infections. Treatment-related death due to septic shock was reported in \n1 (0.8%) patients. Fatal severe infection was reported in 2 (1.53%) patients in the MYLOTARG arm and \n4 (2.92%) patients in the control arm.\n\nIn the combination therapy study (N=131), all grades and Grade 3/4 bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions were \nreported in 118 (90.1%) and 27 (20.6%) patients, respectively. The most frequent Grade 3 \nbleeding/haemorrhagic reactions were haematemesis (3.1%), haemoptysis (3.1%), and haematuria (2.3%). \nGrade 4 bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions were reported in 4 (3.1%) patients (gastrointestinal haemorrhage, \nhaemorrhage, and pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage [2 patients]). Fatal bleeding/haemorrhagic reactions\nwere reported in 3 (2.3%) patients (cerebral haematoma, intracranial haematoma, and subdural haematoma).\n\nManagement of patients with severe infection, bleeding/haemorrhage, or other effects of myelosuppression, \nincluding severe neutropenia or persistent thrombocytopenia, may require a dose delay or permanent \ndiscontinuation of MYLOTARG (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. \n\nIn clinical studies of MYLOTARG in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, the immunogenicity of \nMYLOTARG was evaluated using 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).\n\nPatients in the Phase 2 trials did not develop antidrug antibodies (ADAs) and only 2 patients in a Phase 1 \ntrial developed antibodies against the calicheamicin-linker complex, 1 of whom had reduced hP67.6 plasma \nconcentrations. Overall, the incidence rate of ADA development after MYLOTARG treatment was < 1% \nacross the 4 clinical studies with ADA data. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn between the presence of \nantibodies and potential impact on efficacy and safety due to the limited number of patients with positive \nADAs.\n\nThe detection of ADAs is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The incidence of \nantibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, \ncirculating gemtuzumab ozogamicin concentrations, sample handling, timing of sample collection, \nconcomitant treatments and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to \ngemtuzumab ozogamicin with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.\n\n\n\n15\n\nPaediatric population\n\nPreviously untreated AML\n\nThe safety and efficacy of MYLOTARG in children and adolescents with previously untreated AML below \nthe age of 15 years has not been established (see section 4.2).\n\nIn the completed randomised paediatric Phase 3 Study AAML0531 (see section 5.1) of gemtuzumab \nozogamicin combined with intensive first-line therapy in 1,063 newly diagnosed children (93.7% of patients \n<18 years of age), and young adults (6.3% of patients) with de novo AML aged 0 to 29 years, the safety \nprofile was similar with that observed in the other studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin combined with \nintensive chemotherapy in adult patients with de novo AML. However, the optimal dose of gemtuzumab \nozogamicin for paediatric patients was not established, since in Study AAML0531 during the second \nintensification period after the second dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a larger proportion of patients in the \ngemtuzumab ozogamicin arm experienced prolonged neutrophil recovery time (> 59 days) as compared with \nthe comparator arm (21.0% versus 11.5%), and more patients died during remission (5.5% versus 2.8%).\n\nRelapsed or refractory AML\n\nThe safety and efficacy of MYLOTARG in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory AML has not been \nestablished (see sections 4.1 and 4.2).\n\nSafety results observed in a systematic literature review of studies evaluating MYLOTARG in paediatric \npatients (see section 5.1), are presented in Table 7.\n\nTable 7.

It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo cases of overdose with MYLOTARG were reported in clinical experience. Single doses higher than \n9 mg/m2 in adults were not tested. Treatment of MYLOTARG overdose should consist of general supportive \nmeasures.\n\n\n\n16\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC05\n\nMechanism of action\n\nGemtuzumab ozogamicin is a CD33-directed ADC. Gemtuzumab is a humanised immunoglobulin class G \nsubtype 4 (IgG4) antibody which specifically recognises human CD33. The antibody portion binds \nspecifically to the CD33 antigen, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein found on the surface of myeloid \nleukaemic blasts and immature normal cells of myelomonocytic lineage, but not on normal haematopoietic \nstem cells. The small molecule, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin, is a cytotoxic semisynthetic natural product. \nN-acetyl gamma calicheamicin is covalently attached to the antibody via an AcBut (4-(4-acetylphenoxy) \nbutanoic acid) linker. Non-clinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is due \nto the binding of the ADC to CD33-expressing cancer cells, followed by internalisation of the ADC-CD33 \ncomplex, and the intracellular release of N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide via hydrolytic \ncleavage of the linker. Activation of N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide induces \ndouble-stranded DNA breaks, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. \n\nSaturation of a high percentage of CD33 antigenic sites is presumed to be required for maximum delivery of \ncalicheamicin to leukaemic blast cells. Several single agent studies measured CD33 saturation \npost-MYLOTARG dose in patients with relapsed and refractory AML. Across all studies, near maximal \nperipheral CD33 saturation was observed post-MYLOTARG dose at all dose levels of 2 mg/m\u00b2 and above, \nsuggesting that a low dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is sufficient to bind all available CD33 sites.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nALFA-0701 study of previously untreated patients with de novo AML\n\nThe efficacy and safety of MYLOTARG were evaluated in a multicentre, randomised, open-label Phase 3 \nstudy comparing the addition of MYLOTARG to a standard chemotherapy induction regimen of \ndaunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) versus DA alone. Eligible patients were between 50 and 70 years of age \nwith previously untreated de novo AML (Study ALFA-0701). Patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia \n(APL, AML3) and patients with AML arising from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or secondary AML\nwere excluded from the study.\n\nThe primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). The secondary endpoints included CR and CRp rates, \nrelapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and safety of the combination DA with or without \nMYLOTARG.\n\nIn total, 271 patients were randomised in this study with 135 to induction treatment of 3+7 DA plus \nfractionated 3 mg/m2 \u00d7 3 doses of MYLOTARG and 136 to 3+7 DA alone (see section 4.2). A second course \nof induction therapy with DA but without MYLOTARG, regardless of the randomisation arm, was allowed. \nPatients in either arm who did not receive the second course of induction therapy and did not achieve a CR \nafter induction could receive a salvage course comprised of idarubicin, AraC, and granulocyte colony-\nstimulating factor (G-CSF).\n\nPatients with CR or CRp received consolidation therapy with 2 courses of treatment including DNR and \nAraC with or without MYLOTARG according to their initial randomisation. Patients who experienced \nremission were also eligible for allogeneic transplantation. An interval of at least 2 months between the last \ndose of MYLOTARG and transplantation was recommended.\n\n\n\n17\n\nOverall, the median age of patients was 62 years (range 50 to 70 years) and most patients (87.8%) had an \nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 1 at baseline. Baseline \ncharacteristics were balanced between treatment arms with the exception of gender as a higher percentage of \nmales were enrolled in the MYLOTARG arm (54.8%) than in the DA alone arm (44.1%). Overall, 59.0% \nand 65.3% of patients had documented favourable/intermediate-risk disease by the National Comprehensive \nCancer Network (NCCN) and European LeukaemiaNet (ELN) 2010 risk classifications, respectively. CD33 \nexpression on AML blasts by flow cytometry harmonised from local laboratory results was determined in \n194/271 (71.6%) patients overall. Few patients (13.7%) had low CD33 expression (less than 30% of blasts).\n\nThe trial met its primary objective of demonstrating that MYLOTARG added in fractionated doses \n(3 mg/m2 \u00d7 3) to standard induction chemotherapy for patients with previously untreated de novo AML \nresulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in EFS. Median EFS was \n17.3 months (95% CI: 13.4, 30.0) in the MYLOTARG arm versus 9.5 months (95% CI: 8.1, 12.0) in the DA \nalone arm; hazard ratio (HR) 0.562 (95% CI: 0.415, 0.762); 2-sided p=0.0002 by log-rank test. Efficacy data \nfrom ALFA-0701 study are summarised in Table 8, and the Kaplan-Meier plot for EFS is shown in Figure 1.\n\nTable 8.

Based on the Cox Proportional Hazards Model Versus daunorubicin + cytarabine.\nc. 2-sided p-value from the log-rank test.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nPreviously untreated AML\n\nIn a randomised study (COG AAML0531) that evaluated standard chemotherapy alone or combined with \nMYLOTARG in 1,063 newly diagnosed children with AML (93.7% of patients < 18 years of age), and \nyoung adults (6.3% of patients); mean age was 8.9 years (range: 0-29 years), patients with de novo AML \nwere randomly assigned to either standard 5-course chemotherapy alone or to the same chemotherapy with \n2 doses of MYLOTARG (3 mg/m2/dose) administered once in induction Course 1 and once in intensification \nCourse 2. The study showed that addition of MYLOTARG to intensive chemotherapy improved EFS \n(3 years: 50.6% versus 44.0%; HR 0.838; 95% CI: 0.706, 0.995; p=0.0431) in de novo AML owing to a \nreduced relapse risk, with a trend towards longer OS in the MYLOTARG arm which was not statistically \nsignificant (3 years: 72.4% versus 67.6%; HR 0.904; 95% CI: 0.721, 1.133; p=0.3799). However, it was also \nfound that increased toxicity (post-remission toxic mortality) was observed in patients with low-risk AML \nwhich was attributed to the prolonged neutropenia that occurred after receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin\nduring intensification Course 2 (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Overall, 29 (5.5%) of patients in the MYLOTARG \narm and 15 (2.8%) patients in the comparator arm died during remission. Thus, the optimal dose of \ngemtuzumab ozogamicin for paediatric patients was not established (see section 4.2).\n\nRelapsed or refractory AML\n\nA systematic literature review of studies was conducted to evaluate MYLOTARG in paediatric patients with \nrelapsed or refractory AML, which included 454 patients receiving MYLOTARG either as a monotherapy \n\n\n\n21\n\n(single or fractionated dosing) or combination therapy from 16 published papers plus the US Expanded \nAccess Study (see section 4.8). The median study size was 15 patients, with a range of 5-105 patients. The\noverall minimum and maximum ages range from 0 years to 22.3 years, with an overall median age of\n8.7 years at the time of treatment.\n\nMost studies were in the compassionate use setting (70.6%). MYLOTARG was given as monotherapy in \n47.1%, part of a combination in 23.5%, and in both settings in 29.4% of the studies. Total dosing of \nMYLOTARG ranged from 1.8 mg/m2 to 9 mg/m2. When MYLOTARG was given in combination, a \ncytarabine based regimen was used in 8 of the 9 studies. In 23.5% of the studies the majority of patients \nreceived fractionated (3 mg/m2 on Day 1, 4, 7) doses of MYLOTARG, while in 35.3% of the studies doses \nhigher than 3 mg/m2 were given. MYLOTARG was given as induction treatment in most studies (82.4%).\n\nWith MYLOTARG monotherapy, the response rate (CR/CRp/CRi; weighted average across studies) was\n33.3% with fractionated dosing (1 study) and 24.3% with non-fractionated dosing (9 studies). In the \ncombination setting, the response rate was 49.0% with non-fractionated MYLOTARG (3 studies) and 38.8% \nwith fractionated MYLOTARG (2 studies). \n\nSafety information on myelosuppression, infections, VOD overall and VOD post-HSCT, and death, which \nare known adverse events for MYLOTARG (see section 4.8 and Table 7), was obtained from literature. \n\nLimitations of this analysis include the small sample size of some studies, heterogeneity of the studies, and \nthe lack of control data in this setting.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nGemtuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of CD33-directed monoclonal \nantibody (hP67.6) that is covalently linked to the cytotoxic agent N-acetyl-gamma calicheamicin. The \npharmacokinetics (PK) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is described by measuring PK characteristics of the \nantibody (hP67.6) as well as total and unconjugated calicheamicin derivatives. Given that the hP67.6 portion \nrenders target selectivity on the intact molecule, and that gemtuzumab ozogamicin dosages are reported in \nterms of milligrams of protein (hP67.6), the hP67.6 concentration results are reported as the primary PK \nmeasures. After gemtuzumab ozogamicin binds to the target it is internalised and N-acetyl calicheamicin is \nreleased by hydrolytic cleavage. Determination of PK parameters for unconjugated calicheamicin was \nlimited due to the low systemic concentration levels.\n\nNo clinical PK data have been collected using the fractionated regimen; however, the PK have been \nsimulated using the population PK model. Although the total dose of the fractionated dosing regimen is half \nof that of the original dosing regimen (9 versus 18 mg/m2), the predicted total AUC of hP67.6 over the \ncourse of treatment is 25%, and Cmax is 24%, of the values for original 9 mg/m2 dosing regimen, since the PK \nis nonlinear. When gemtuzumab ozogamicin is administered at 3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, and 7, the Cmax of \nhP67.6, which would occur at the end of infusion, is predicted to be 0.38 mg/L following the first dose and \nincreased to 0.63 mg/L after the third dose.\n\nDistribution\n\nIn vitro, the binding N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide to human plasma proteins is \napproximately 97%. In vitro, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide is a substrate of \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp). In patients, the total volume of distribution of hP67.6 antibody (sum of V1 [10 L] and \nV2 [15 L]) was found to be approximately 25 L. \n\nBiotransformation\n\nThe primary metabolic pathway of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is anticipated to be hydrolytic release of \nN acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide. In vitro studies demonstrated that \nN-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide is extensively metabolised, primarily via nonenzymatic \nreduction of the disulphide moiety. The activity (cytotoxicity) of the resultant metabolites is expected to be \n\n\n\n22\n\nsignificantly attenuated. In patients, unconjugated calicheamicin plasma levels were typically low, with a\npredicted mean Cmax of 1.5 ng/mL following the third dose.\n\nInteractions with other medicinal products\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on gemtuzumab ozogamicin\n\nIn vitro, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide is primarily metabolised via nonenzymatic \nreduction. Therefore, coadministration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome \nP450 (CYP) or uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) drug metabolising enzymes are unlikely \nto alter exposure to N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide.\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses, the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with \nhydroxyurea, DNR, and AraC is not predicted to cause clinically meaningful changes in the PK of hP67.6 or \nunconjugated calicheamicin.\n\nEffect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on other medicinal products\n\nEffect on CYP substrates\n\nIn vitro, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin had a low \npotential to inhibit the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6 (tested only using gemtuzumab ozogamicin),\nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. In \nvitro, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin had a low potential to \ninduce the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations.\n\nEffect on UGT substrates\n\nIn vitro, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide had a low potential to inhibit the activities of \nUGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations.\n\nEffect on drug transporter substrates\n\nIn vitro, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide had a low potential to inhibit the activities of \nP-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance associated \nprotein (MRP) 2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1 and MATE2K, organic anion transporter \n(OAT)1 and OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)1 and OCT2, and organic anion transporting \npolypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations.\n\nEffect on co-administered chemotherapeutic agents\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses, the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with DNR \nand AraC is not predicted to cause clinically meaningful changes in the PK of these agents.\n\nElimination\n\nBased on Population PK analyses, the predicted clearance (CL) value of hP67.6 from plasma was 3 L/h \nimmediately after the first dose and then 0.3 L/h. The terminal plasma half-life (t\u00bd) for hP67.6 was predicted \nto be approximately 160 hours for a typical patient at the recommended dose level (3 mg/m2) of \nMYLOTARG. \n\nPharmacokinetics in specific groups of subjects or patients\n\nAge, race, and gender\n\nBased on a population PK analysis, age, race, and gender did not significantly affect gemtuzumab \nozogamicin disposition.\n\n\n\n23\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo formal PK studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\nBased on a population PK analysis, the clearance of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (hP67.6 antibody and \nunconjugated calicheamicin) is not expected to be affected by mild hepatic impairment status, as defined by \nNational Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI ODWG). The analysis included \n405 patients in the following NCI ODWG impairment status categories: mild (B1, n=58 and B2, n=19), \nmoderate (C, n=6), and normal hepatic function (n=322) (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\n\nNo formal PK studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. \n\nBased on a population PK analysis in 406 patients, the clearance of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in patients with \nmild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60-89 mL/min; n=149) or moderate renal impairment \n(CLcr 30-59 mL/min; n=47), was similar to patients with normal renal function (CLcr \u2265 90 mL/min; n=209). \nThe PK of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe results of the population modelling showed that the PK behaviour of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (hP67.6 \nantibody and unconjugated calicheamicin) is similar between adult and paediatric AML patients following \nthe 9 mg/m2 dosing regimen.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeat-dose toxicity\n\nThe main toxicities occurred in the liver, bone marrow and lymphoid organs, haematology parameters \n(decreased RBC mass and WBC counts, mainly lymphocytes), kidney, eye and male and female reproductive \norgans. Effects on liver, kidney and male reproductive organs in rats, and on lymphoid tissues in monkeys \n(approximately 18 times for rats, and 36 times for monkeys, the human clinical exposure after the third \nhuman dose of 3 mg/m2 based on AUC168) were not reversible. Effects on female reproductive organs and \nthe eye in monkeys were adverse in the 12-week study (approximately 193 and 322 times, respectively, the \nhuman clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on AUC168). The relevance of the \nirreversible animal findings to humans is uncertain. Nervous system effects have not been observed in \nanimals after administration of MYLOTARG. Nervous system alterations were identified in rats with other \nantibody-calicheamicin conjugates.\n\nGenotoxicity\n\nGemtuzumab ozogamicin was found to be clastogenic. This is consistent with the known induction of DNA \nbreaks by calicheamicin and other enediyne antitumour antibiotics. N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin DMH \n(the released cytotoxin) was found to be mutagenic and clastogenic.\n\nCarcinogenicity\n\nFormal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. In toxicity studies, \nrats developed preneoplastic lesions (minimal to slight oval cell hyperplasia) in the liver approximately \n54 times the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on AUC168. There were no \npreneoplastic or neoplastic lesions observed in monkeys up to approximately 115 times the human clinical \nexposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on AUC168. The relevance of these animal findings to \nhumans is uncertain.\n\n\n\n24\n\nReproductive toxicity\n\nIn a female rat fertility study slightly lower numbers of corpora lutea and increased embryolethality were \nobserved in the presence of maternal toxicity (approximately 9.7 times the human clinical exposure after the \nthird human dose of 3 mg/m2 based on AUC168). Effects on the reproductive tract of female monkeys were \nobserved in the 12-week study (atrophy of the ovary, oviduct, uterus, and cervix; approximately 193 times \nthe human clinical exposure after the third dose of 3 mg/m2). \n\nIn a male fertility study, effects on male reproduction included lower spermatogonia and spermatocytes, \ndecreases in testicular spermatids and epididymal sperm, vacuolation of the nucleus in spermatids, and/or \nappearance of giant cells. Additional findings included effects on the testes, epididymides and mammary \ngland as well as fertility. When male rats were mated again after a 9-week non-dosing period, effects on \nsperm and fertility were worse but there was partial recovery of the lower spermatogonia and spermatocytes \nin the testes. Effects on male rat reproductive organs were partially reversible or not reversible (see \nsection 4.6). Male reproductive effects (testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles) in monkeys were observed at \napproximately 66 times the human clinical exposure after the third dose of 3 mg/m2.\n\nIn an embryo-foetal toxicity study lower foetal body weight, higher incidence of foetal wavy ribs, and lower \nincidence of foetal skeletal ossification were observed. Increased embryolethality and foetal morphological \nanomalies included digital malformations, absence of the aortic arch, anomalies in the long bones in the \nforelimbs, misshapen scapula, absence of a vertebral centrum, and fused sternebrae. Increased \nembryolethality was also observed in the presence of maternal toxicity. The lowest dose with embryo-foetal\neffects correlated with 9.7 times the human clinical exposure after the third human dose of 3 mg/m2, based \non AUC168 (see section 4.6).\n\n6.

What MYLOTARG is and what it is used for\n\nMYLOTARG contains the active substance gemtuzumab ozogamicin, an anticancer medicine, which is \nmade up of a monoclonal antibody linked to a substance intended to kill cancer cells. This substance is \ndelivered to cancer cells by the monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a protein which recognises \ncertain cancer cells. \n\nMYLOTARG is used to treat a certain type of cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in which the \nbone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells. MYLOTARG is intended for the treatment of AML for \npatients age 15 years and above who have not tried other treatments. MYLOTARG is not for use in patients \nwith a type of cancer called acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL).\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given MYLOTARG\n\nMYLOTARG should not be given if you:\n\uf0b7 are allergic to gemtuzumab ozogamicin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions \nWhen you first receive this medicine and during the course of treatment, tell your doctor or nurse if you:\n\n\uf0b7 have or ever had liver problems: MYLOTARG may cause, during or after treatment, a potentially \nlife-threatening condition called hepatic venoocclusive disease, in which the blood vessels in the liver\nbecome damaged and obstructed by blood clots which may include fluid retention, rapid weight gain, \nincreased liver size (which may be painful), and ascites (excessive accumulation of fluid in the \nabdominal cavity).  \n\n\uf0b7 allergic reaction: experience a high-pitched whistling sound during breathing (wheezing), difficult \nbreathing, shortness of breath or cough with or without mucous, hives, itching, swelling, or feeling \nfever and chills (signs of an infusion related reaction) during or shortly after the MYLOTARG \ninfusion.\n\n\n\n37\n\n\uf0b7 infection: have or think you have, an infection, develop chills or shivering, or feel warm, or have \nfever. Some infections may be serious and may be life-threatening.\n\n\uf0b7 bleeding: have unusual bleeding, bleeding from your gums, bruising easily or getting nose bleeds on a \nregular basis.\n\n\uf0b7 anaemia: have headaches, feel tired, experience dizziness, or look pale .\n\uf0b7 infusion reaction: experience during or shortly after MYLOTARG infusion symptoms such as\n\ndizziness, decreased urination, confusion, vomiting, nausea, swelling, shortness of breath, or heart \nrhythm disturbances (this may be a potentially life-threatening complication known as tumour lysis \nsyndrome). \n\nChildren and adolescents\nMYLOTARG must not to be used in children and adolescents under 15 years of age because limited data are \navailable in this population.\n\nOther medicines and MYLOTARG\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:\n\nUse appropriate aseptic technique for the reconstitution and dilution procedures. MYLOTARG is light \nsensitive and should be protected from ultraviolet light during reconstitution, dilution and administration.\n\nReconstitution\n\uf0b7 Calculate the dose (mg) of MYLOTARG required.\n\uf0b7 Prior to reconstitution, allow the vial to reach room temperature (below 30\u00b0C) for approximately\n\n5 minutes. Reconstitute each 5 mg vial with 5 mL of water for injections to obtain a single-use\nsolution of 1 mg/mL of gemtuzumab ozogamicin.\n\n\uf0b7 Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. Do not shake.\n\uf0b7 Inspect the reconstituted solution for particulates and discolouration. The reconstituted solution may\n\ncontain small white to off-white, opaque to translucent, and amorphous to fibre-like particles.\n\uf0b7 MYLOTARG contains no bacteriostatic preservatives.\n\uf0b7 If the reconstituted solution cannot be used immediately, it may be stored in the original vial for up to\n\n16 hours in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C) or up to 3 hours at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C). Protect from\nlight and do not freeze.\n\nDilution\n\uf0b7 Calculate the required volume of the reconstituted solution needed to obtain the appropriate dose\n\naccording to patient body surface area. Withdraw this amount from the vial using a syringe. Mylotarg \nvials contain 5 mg of drug product with no overfill. When reconstituted to a 1 mg/mL concentration \nas directed, the extractable content of the vial is 4.5 mg (4.5 mL). Protect from light. Discard any \nunused reconstituted solution left in the vial. \n\n\uf0b7 Doses must be mixed to a concentration between 0.075 mg/mL to 0.234 mg/mL according to the\nfollowing instructions:\n\no Doses less than 3.9 mg must be prepared for administration by syringe. Add the\nreconstituted MYLOTARG solution to a syringe with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution for injection to a final concentration between 0.075 mg/mL to 0.234 mg/mL. Protect \nfrom light.\n\no Doses greater than or equal to 3.9 mg are to be diluted in a syringe or an IV bag in an\nappropriate volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure a \nfinal concentration between 0.075 mg/mL to 0.234 mg/mL. Protect from light.\n\n\uf0b7 Gently invert the infusion container to mix the diluted solution. Do not shake.\n\n\n\n43\n\n\uf0b7 Following dilution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, MYLOTARG \nsolution should be infused immediately. If not used immediately, the diluted solution may be stored \nup to 18 hours in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C) and up to 6 hours at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C). The \nallowed time at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C) includes the time required for preparation of the \ndiluted solution, equilibration, if needed, and administration to the patient. The maximum time from \npreparation of the diluted solution through administration should not exceed 24 hours. Protect from \nlight and do not freeze.\n\n\uf0b7 It is recommended that the infusion container be made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with DEHP, \nethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) or polyolefin (polypropylene and/or polyethylene).\n\nAdministration\n\uf0b7 Filtration of the diluted solution is required. An in-line, low protein-binding 0.2 micron \n\npolyethersulphone (PES) filter must be used for infusion of MYLOTARG.\n\uf0b7 Doses administered by syringe must utilize small bore infusion lines (microbore) with an in-line, low \n\nprotein-binding 0.2 micron polyethersulphone (PES) filter.\n\uf0b7 During the infusion, the intravenous bag or syringes needs to be protected from light using a light\n\n(including ultraviolet light) blocking cover. The infusion line does not need to be protected from light.\n\uf0b7 Infuse the diluted solution for 2 hours. The infusion must be completed prior to the end of the allowed \n\n6-hour storage of the diluted solution at room temperature (below 30\u00b0C).\n\uf0b7 Infusion lines made of PVC (DEHP- or non-DEHP-containing), polyurethane or polyethylene are \n\nrecommended.\n\nDo not mix MYLOTARG with, or administer as an infusion with, other medicinal products.\n\nDisposal\n\uf0b7 Toxic waste disposal procedures prescribed for anticancer medicinal products must be used.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

doctor right away if you have rapid weight gain, feel pain in the upper right side of your abdomen, have accumulation of fluid causing abdominal swelling. your doctor may do blood tests and find abnormalities in liver blood tests, which might be signs of a potentially life-threatening condition called venoocclusive liver disease. bleeding (signs of a low number of blood cells known as platelets) tell your doctor right away if you bruise easily or get nose bleeds on a regular basis, or have black tarry stools, coughing up of blood, bloody sputum, or change in your mental status. infections (signs of a low number of white blood cells known as neutrophils) some infections may be serious and can be due to viruses, bacteria, or other causes that may be life-threatening. complication known as tumour lysis syndrome tell your doctor right away if you experience dizziness, decreased urination, confusion, vomiting, nausea, swelling, shortness of breath, or heart rhythm disturbances. infusion reactions medicines of this type (monoclonal antibodies) can cause infusion reactions such as a rash, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, a tight chest, chills or fever, back pain. other side effects may include: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): infections (including serious infections) reduced number of blood platelets (cells that help blood to clot) reduced number of white blood cells which may result in general weakness and a tendency to develop infections reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia) which may result in fatigue and shortness of breath high blood sugar decreased appetite headache rapid heartbeat bleeding low blood pressure high blood pressure shortness of breath vomiting diarrhoea pain in the abdomen feeling sick
