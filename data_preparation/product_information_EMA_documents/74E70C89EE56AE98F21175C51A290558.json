NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nUrorec 4 mg hard capsules \nUrorec 8 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nUrorec 4 mg hard capsules \nEach hard capsule contains 4 mg silodosin. \n \nUrorec 8 mg hard capsules \nEach hard capsule contains 8 mg silodosin. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \n \n\nUrorec 4 mg hard capsules \nYellow, opaque, hard gelatin capsule, size 3 (approximately 15.9 x 5.8 mm). \n \nUrorec 8 mg hard capsules \nWhite, opaque, hard gelatin capsule, size 0 (approximately 21.7 x 7.6 mm). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nTreatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adult men.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is one capsule of Urorec 8 mg daily. For special patient populations, one \ncapsule of Urorec 4 mg daily is recommended (see below). \n \nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in the elderly (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment (CLCR ≥ 50 to ≤ 80 mL/min).  \nA starting dose of 4 mg once daily is recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment \n(CLCR ≥ 30 to < 50 mL/min), which may be increased to 8 mg once daily after one week of treatment, \ndepending on the individual patient’s response. The use in patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLCR < 30 mL/min) is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  \nAs no data are available, the use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\nema-combined-h1092en Version: 2.0\n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Urorec in the paediatric population for the indication of benign prostatic \nhyperplasia (BPH). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nThe capsule should be taken with food, preferably at the same time every day. The capsule should not \nbe broken or chewed but swallowed whole, preferably with a glass of water. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) \nIFIS (a variant of small pupil syndrome) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on \nα1-blockers or previously treated with α1-blockers. This may lead to increased procedural \ncomplications during the operation.  \nThe initiation of therapy with silodosin is not recommended in patients for whom cataract surgery is \nscheduled. Discontinuing treatment with an α1-blocker 1-2 weeks prior to cataract surgery has been \nrecommended, but the benefit and duration of stopping the therapy prior to cataract surgery has not yet \nbeen established.  \nDuring pre-operative assessment, eye surgeons and ophthalmic teams should consider whether patients \nscheduled for cataract surgery are being or have been treated with silodosin, in order to ensure that \nappropriate measures will be in place to manage IFIS during surgery.  \n \nOrthostatic effects \nThe incidence of orthostatic effects with silodosin is very low. However, a reduction in blood pressure \ncan occur in individual patients, leading in rare cases to syncope. At the first signs of orthostatic \nhypotension (such as postural dizziness), the patient should sit or lie down until the symptoms have \ndisappeared. In patients with orthostatic hypotension, treatment with silodosin is not recommended. \n \nRenal impairment  \nThe use of silodosin in patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 ml/min) is not recommended \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n \n\nHepatic impairment \nSince no data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment, the use of silodosin in these \npatients is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n \nCarcinoma of the prostate \nSince BPH and prostate carcinoma may present the same symptoms and can co-exist, patients thought \nto have BPH should be examined prior to starting therapy with silodosin, to rule out the presence of \ncarcinoma of the prostate. Digital rectal examination and, when necessary, determination of prostate \nspecific antigen (PSA) should be performed before treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. \n \nTreatment with silodosin leads to a decrease in the amount of semen released during orgasm that may \ntemporarily affect male fertility. This effect disappears after discontinuation of silodosin (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n\nema-combined-h1092en Version: 2.0\n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nSilodosin is metabolised extensively, mainly via CYP3A4, alcohol dehydrogenase and UGT2B7. \nSilodosin is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein. Substances that inhibit (such as ketoconazole, \nitraconazole, ritonavir or cyclosporine) or induce (such as rifampicin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, \nphenytoin) these enzymes and transporters may affect the plasma concentrations of silodosin and its \nactive metabolite. \n \nAlpha-blockers \nThere is inadequate information about the safe use of silodosin in association with other \nα-adrenoreceptor antagonists. Consequently, the concomitant use of other α-adrenoreceptor \nantagonists is not recommended. \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn an interaction study, a 3.7-fold increase in maximum silodosin plasma concentrations and a 3.1-fold \nincrease in silodosin exposure (i.e. AUC) were observed with concurrent administration of a potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole 400 mg). Concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as \nketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir or cyclosporine) is not recommended. \nWhen silodosin was co-administered with a CYP3A4 inhibitor of moderate potency such as diltiazem, \nan increase in silodosin AUC of approximately 30% was observed, but Cmax and half-life were not \naffected. This change is clinically not relevant and no dose adjustment is required. \n \nPDE-5 inhibitors \nMinimal pharmacodynamic interactions have been observed between silodosin and maximum doses of \nsildenafil or tadalafil. In a placebo-controlled study in 24 subjects 45-78 years of age receiving \nsilodosin, the co-administration of sildenafil 100 mg or tadalafil 20 mg induced no clinically \nmeaningful mean decreases in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, as assessed by orthostatic tests \n(standing versus supine). In the subjects over 65 years, the mean decreases at the various time points \nwere between 5 and 15 mmHg (systolic) and 0 and 10 mmHg (diastolic). Positive orthostatic tests \nwere only slightly more common during co-administration; however, no symptomatic orthostasis or \ndizziness occurred. Patients taking PDE-5 inhibitors concomitantly with silodosin should be monitored \nfor possible adverse reactions. \n \nAntihypertensives \nIn the clinical study program, many patients were on concomitant antihypertensive therapy (mostly \nagents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and diuretics) \nwithout experiencing an increase in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension. Nevertheless, caution \nshould be exercised when starting concomitant use with antihypertensives and patients should be \nmonitored for possible adverse reactions.  \n \nDigoxin \nSteady state levels of digoxin, a substrate of P-glycoprotein, were not significantly affected by \nco-administration with silodosin 8 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is required. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nNot applicable as silodosin is intended for male patients only. \n \nFertility \nIn clinical studies, the occurrence of ejaculation with reduced or no semen has been observed during \ntreatment with silodosin (see section 4.8), due to the pharmacodynamic properties of silodosin. Before \nstarting treatment, the patient should be informed that this effect may occur, temporarily affecting \nmale fertility.  \n \n\nema-combined-h1092en Version: 2.0\n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nUrorec has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \ninformed about the possible occurrence of symptoms related to postural hypotension (such as \ndizziness) and should be cautioned about driving or operating machines until they know how silodosin \nwill affect them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of silodosin has been evaluated in four Phase II-III double-blind controlled clinical studies \n(with 931 patients receiving silodosin 8 mg once daily and 733 patients receiving placebo) and in two \nlong-term open-label extension phase studies. In total, 1,581 patients have received silodosin at a dose \nof 8 mg once daily, including 961 patients exposed for at least 6 months and 384 patients exposed for \n1 year. \n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions reported with silodosin in placebo controlled clinical studies and \nduring long-term use were ejaculatory disorders such as retrograde ejaculation and anejaculation \n(ejaculatory volume reduced or absent), with a frequency of 23%. This may temporarily affect male \nfertility. It is reversible within a few days upon discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nIn the table below, adverse reactions reported in all clinical studies and in the worldwide \npost-marketing experience for which a reasonable causal relationship exists are listed by MedDRA \nsystem organ class and frequency: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from available data).

Orthostatic hypotension may occasionally lead to syncope (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) \n\nIFIS has been reported during cataract surgery (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSilodosin was evaluated at doses of up to 48 mg/day in healthy male subjects. The dose-limiting \nadverse reaction was postural hypotension. If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric \nlavage may be considered. Should overdose of silodosin lead to hypotension, cardiovascular support \nhas to be provided. Dialysis is unlikely to be of significant benefit since silodosin is highly (96.6%) \nprotein bound. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists, ATC code: G04CA04. \n \nMechanism of action \nSilodosin is highly selective for α1A-adrenoreceptors that are primarily located in the human prostate, \nbladder base, bladder neck, prostatic capsule and prostatic urethra. Blockade of these \nα1A-adrenoreceptors causes smooth muscle in these tissues to relax, thus decreasing bladder outlet \nresistance, without affecting detrusor smooth muscle contractility.

It has been demonstrated in vitro that the α1A:α1B binding ratio of silodosin \n(162:1) is extremely high.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn a Phase II dose-finding, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study with silodosin 4 or 8 mg \nonce daily, a greater improvement in American Urologic Association (AUA) symptom index score \nwas observed with silodosin 8 mg (-6.8 ± 5.8, n = 90; p = 0.0018) and silodosin 4 mg (-5.7 ± 5.5, \nn = 88; p = 0.0355) as compared to placebo (-4.0 ± 5.5, n = 83). \n \nOver 800 patients with moderate to severe symptoms of BPH (International Prostate Symptom Score, \nIPSS, baseline value ≥13) received silodosin 8 mg once daily in two Phase III placebo-controlled \nclinical studies conducted in the United States and in one placebo- and active-controlled clinical study \nconducted in Europe. In all studies, patients who did not respond to placebo during a 4-week placebo \nrun-in phase were randomised to receive the study treatment. In all studies, patients treated with \nsilodosin had a greater decrease in both storage (irritative) and voiding (obstructive) symptoms of \nBPH as compared to placebo as assessed after 12 weeks of treatment.

The responder rate (i.e. \nimprovement in the IPSS total score by at least 25%) was significantly higher in the silodosin (68%) \nand tamsulosin group (65%), as compared to placebo (53%). \n \nIn the long-term open-label extension phase of these controlled studies, in which patients received \nsilodosin for up to 1 year, the symptom improvement induced by silodosin at week 12 of treatment \nwas maintained over 1 year. \n \nIn a Phase IV clinical trial performed in Europe, with a mean baseline IPSS total score of 18.9 points, \n77.1%were responders to silodosin (as assessed by a change from baseline in the IPSS total score of at \n\nema-combined-h1092en Version: 2.0\n\n\n\n8 \n\nleast 25%). Approximately half of the patients reported an improvement in the most bothersome \nsymptoms complained at baseline by the patients (i.e. nocturia, frequency, decreased stream, urgency, \nterminal dribbling and incomplete emptying), as assessed by the ICS-male questionnaire. \n \nNo significant reduction in supine blood pressure was observed in all clinical studies conducted with \nsilodosin.  \n \nSilodosin 8 mg and 24 mg daily had no statistically significant effect on ECG intervals or cardiac \nrepolarisation relative to placebo.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nUrorec in all subsets of the paediatric population in BPH (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of silodosin and its main metabolites have been evaluated in adult male subjects \nwith and without BPH after single and multiple administrations with doses ranging from 0.1 mg to \n48 mg per day. The pharmacokinetics of silodosin is linear throughout this dose range. \nThe exposure to the main metabolite in plasma, silodosin glucuronide (KMD-3213G), at steady-state \nis about 3-fold that of the parent substance. Silodosin and its glucuronide reach steady-state after \n3 days and 5 days of treatment, respectively. \n \n\nAbsorption \nSilodosin administered orally is well absorbed and absorption is dose proportional. The absolute \nbioavailability is approximately 32%. \nAn in vitro study with Caco-2 cells showed that silodosin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. \nFood decreases Cmax by approximately 30%, increases tmax by approximately 1 hour and has little \neffect on AUC. \nIn healthy male subjects of the target age range (n = 16, mean age 55 ± 8 years) after once-a-day oral \nadministration of 8 mg immediately after breakfast for 7 days, the following pharmacokinetic \nparameters were obtained: Cmax 87 ± 51 ng/mL (sd), tmax 2.5 hours (range 1.0-3.0), AUC \n433 ± 286 ng • h/mL. \n \nDistribution \nSilodosin has a volume of distribution of 0.81 L/kg and is 96.6% bound to plasma proteins. It does not \ndistribute into blood cells. \nProtein binding of silodosin glucuronide is 91%. \n \nBiotransformation \nSilodosin undergoes extensive metabolism through glucuronidation (UGT2B7), alcohol and aldehyde \ndehydrogenase and oxidative pathways, mainly CYP3A4. The main metabolite in plasma, the \nglucuronide conjugate of silodosin (KMD-3213G), that has been shown to be active in vitro, has an \nextended half-life (approximately 24 hours) and reaches plasma concentrations approximately four \ntimes higher than those of silodosin. In vitro data indicate that silodosin does not have the potential to \ninhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzyme systems. \n \n\nElimination  \nFollowing oral administration of 14C-labelled silodosin, the recovery of radioactivity after 7 days was \napproximately 33.5% in urine and 54.9% in faeces. Body clearance of silodosin was approximately \n0.28 L/h/kg. Silodosin is excreted mainly as metabolites, very low amounts of unchanged drug are \nrecovered in urine. The terminal half-life of parent drug and its glucuronide is approximately 11 hours \nand 18 hours, respectively. \n \n\nema-combined-h1092en Version: 2.0\n\n\n\n9 \n\nSpecial populations \n \n\nElderly \n\nExposure to silodosin and its main metabolites does not change significantly with age, even in subjects \nof age over 75 years. \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nSilodosin has not been evaluated in patients less than 18 years of age. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a single-dose study, the pharmacokinetics of silodosin was not altered in nine patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh scores 7 to 9), compared to nine healthy subjects. Results \nfrom this study should be interpreted with caution, since enrolled patients had normal biochemistry \nvalues, indicating normal metabolic function, and they were classified as having moderate liver \nimpairment based on ascites and hepatic encephalopathy.  \nThe pharmacokinetics of silodosin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. \n \nRenal impairment \n\nIn a single-dose study, exposure to silodosin (unbound) in subjects with mild (n = 8) and moderate \nrenal impairment (n = 8) resulted, on average, in an increase of Cmax (1.6-fold) and AUC (1.7-fold) \nrelative to subjects with normal renal function (n = 8). In subjects with severe renal impairment (n = 5) \nincrease of exposure was 2.2-fold for Cmax and 3.7-fold for AUC. Exposure to the main metabolites, \nsilodosin glucuronide and KMD3293, was also increased. \nPlasma level monitoring in a Phase III clinical study showed that levels of total silodosin after 4 weeks \nof treatment did not change in patients with mild impairment (n = 70), compared to patients with \nnormal renal function (n = 155), while the levels were doubled on average in patients with moderate \nimpairment (n = 7). \nA review of safety data of patients enrolled in all clinical studies does not indicate that mild renal \nimpairment (n = 487) poses an additional safety risk during silodosin therapy (such as an increase in \ndizziness or orthostatic hypotension) as compared to patients with normal renal function (n = 955). \nAccordingly, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment. Since only limited \nexperience exists in patients with moderate renal impairment (n = 35), a lower starting dose of 4 mg is \nrecommended. In patients with severe renal impairment administration of Urorec is not recommended.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic potential. Effects in animals (affecting the \nthyroid gland in rodents) were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure, indicating little relevance to clinical use. \nIn male rats, decreased fertility was observed from exposures which were approximately twice the \nexposure at the maximum recommended human dose. The observed effect was reversible. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take Urorec \n3. How to take Urorec \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Urorec \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Urorec is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Urorec is \n \nUrorec belongs to a group of medicines called alpha1A-adrenoreceptor blockers. \nUrorec is selective for the receptors located in the prostate, bladder and urethra. By blocking these \nreceptors, it causes smooth muscle in these tissues to relax. This makes it easier for you to pass water \nand relieves your symptoms. \n \nWhat Urorec is used for \n \nUrorec is used in adult men to treat the urinary symptoms associated with benign enlargement of the \nprostate (prostatic hyperplasia), such as: \n difficulty in starting to pass water, \n a feeling of not completely emptying the bladder, \n a more frequent need to pass water, even at night. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Urorec \n \nDo not take Urorec \n \nif you are allergic to silodosin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Urorec \n \n If you are undergoing eye surgery because of cloudiness of the lens (cataract surgery), it is \n\nimportant that you immediately inform your eye specialist that you are using or have previously \n\nema-combined-h1092en Version: 2.0\n\n\n\n26 \n\nused Urorec. This is because some patients treated with this kind of medicine experienced a loss \nof muscle tone in the iris (the coloured circular part of the eye) during such a surgery. The \nspecialist can take appropriate precautions with respect to medicine and surgical techniques to \nbe used. Ask your doctor whether or not you should postpone or temporarily stop taking Urorec \nwhen undergoing cataract surgery. \n\n \n If you have ever fainted or felt dizzy when suddenly standing up, please inform your doctor \n\nbefore taking Urorec.  \nDizziness when standing up and occasionally fainting may occur when taking Urorec, \nparticularly when starting treatment or if you are taking other medicines that lower blood \npressure. If this occurs, make sure you sit or lie down straight away until the symptoms have \ndisappeared and inform your doctor as soon as possible (see also section “Driving and using \nmachines”).  \n\n \n If you have severe liver problems, you should not take Urorec, as it was not tested in this \n\ncondition. \n \n If you have problems with your kidneys, please ask your doctor for advice.  \n\nIf you have moderate kidney problems, your doctor will start Urorec with caution and possibly \nwith a lower dose (see section 3 “Dose”).  \nIf you have severe kidney problems, you should not take Urorec. \n\n \n Since a benign enlargement of the prostate and prostate cancer may present the same symptoms, \n\nyour doctor will check you for prostate cancer before starting treatment with Urorec. Urorec \ndoes not treat prostate cancer. \n\n \n The treatment with Urorec may lead to an abnormal ejaculation (decrease in the amount of \n\nsemen released during sex) that may temporarily affect male fertility. This effect disappears \nafter discontinuation of Urorec. Please inform your doctor if you are planning to have children. \n\n \nSodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years since there is no relevant \nindication for this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Urorec \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nTell your doctor in particular, if you take: \n medicines which lower blood pressure (in particular, medicines called alpha1-blockers, such \n\nas prazosin or doxazosin) as there may be the potential risk that the effect of these medicines is \nincreased whilst taking Urorec. \n\n antifungal medicines (such as ketoconazole or itraconazole), medicines used for HIV-AIDS \n(such as ritonavir) or medicines used after transplants to prevent organ rejection (such as \ncyclosporin) because these medicines can increase the blood concentration of Urorec. \n\n medicines used for treating problems in getting or keeping an erection (such as sildenafil or \ntadalafil), since the concomitant use with Urorec might lead to a slight decrease in blood \npressure.  \n\n medicines for epilepsy or rifampicin (a medicine to treat tubercolosis), since the effect of \nUrorec may be reduced. \n\n \n\nema-combined-h1092en Version: 2.0\n\n\n\n27 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nUrorec is not intended for use by women. \n \nFertility \n \nUrorec may reduce the amount of sperm, and so could temporarily affect your ability to father a child. \nIf you are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this \nmedicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nDo not drive or operate machines if you feel faint, dizzy, drowsy or have blurred vision. \n \n \n3. How to take Urorec \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one capsule of Urorec 8 mg per day by oral administration.  \n \nTake the capsule always with food, preferably at the same time every day. Do not break or chew the \ncapsule, but swallow it whole, preferably with a glass of water. \n \nPatients with kidney problems  \nIf you have moderate kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a different dose. For this purpose \nUrorec 4 mg hard capsules are available. \n \nIf you take more Urorec than you should \n \nIf you have taken more than one capsule, inform your doctor as soon as possible. If you become dizzy \nor feel weak, tell your doctor straight away. \n \nIf you forget to take Urorec \n \nYou may take your capsule later the same day if you have forgotten to take it earlier. If it is almost \ntime for the next dose, skip the dose you missed. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \ncapsule. \n \nIf you stop taking Urorec \n \nIf you stop treatment, your symptoms may re-appear. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
