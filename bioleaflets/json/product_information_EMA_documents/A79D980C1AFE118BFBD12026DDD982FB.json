NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nHALAVEN 0.44 mg/ml solution for injection\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne ml contains eribulin mesilate equivalent to 0.44 mg eribulin.\nEach 2 ml vial contains eribulin mesilate equivalent to 0.88 mg eribulin.\nEach 3 ml vial contains eribulin mesilate equivalent to 1.32 mg eribulin.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection).\n\nClear, colourless aqueous solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nHALAVEN is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast \ncancer who have progressed after at least one chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced disease (see \nsection 5.1). Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or \nmetastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments.\n\nHALAVEN is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable liposarcoma who have \nreceived prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) for advanced or metastatic disease \n(see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nHALAVEN should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in \nthe appropriate use of cytotoxic medicinal products.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of eribulin as the ready to use solution is 1.23 mg/m2 which should be \nadministered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle. \n\nPlease note:\nIn the EU the recommended dose refers to the base of the active substance (eribulin). Calculation of \nthe individual dose to be administered to a patient must be based on the strength of the ready to use \nsolution that contains 0.44 mg/ml eribulin and the dose recommendation of 1.23 mg/m2. The dose \nreduction recommendations shown below are also shown as the dose of eribulin to be administered \nbased on the strength of the ready to use solution.\n\nIn the pivotal trials, the corresponding publications and in some other regions e.g. the United States\nand Switzerland, the recommended dose is based on the salt form (eribulin mesilate).\n\nPatients may experience nausea or vomiting. Antiemetic prophylaxis including corticosteroids should \nbe considered.\n\n\n\n3\n\nDose delays during therapy\n\nThe administration of HALAVEN should be delayed on Day 1 or Day 8 for any of the following:\n- Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1 x 109/l\n- Platelets < 75 x 109/l\n- Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities.\n\nDose reduction during therapy\n\nDose reduction recommendations for retreatment are shown in the following table. \nDose reduction recommendations\n\nAdverse reaction after previous HALAVEN administration Recommended dose of \neribulin\n\nHaematological:\nANC < 0.5 x 109/l lasting more than 7 days \n\n0.97 mg/m2\n\nANC < 1 x 109/l neutropenia complicated by fever or \ninfection\nPlatelets < 25 x 109/l thrombocytopenia \nPlatelets < 50 x 109/l thrombocytopenia complicated by \nhaemorrhage or requiring blood or platelet transfusion\n\nNon-haematological:\nAny Grade 3 or 4 in the previous cycle\n\nReoccurrence of any haematological or non-haematological \nadverse reactions as specified above\n\nDespite reduction to 0.97 mg/m2 0.62 mg/m2\n\nDespite reduction to 0.62 mg/m2 Consider discontinuation\n\nThe dose of eribulin should not be re-escalated after it has been reduced.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\n\nImpaired liver function due to metastases\nThe recommended dose of eribulin in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) is \n0.97 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The \nrecommended dose of eribulin in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is \n0.62 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.\nSevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) has not been studied but it is expected that a more marked \ndose reduction is needed if eribulin is used in these patients.\n\nImpaired liver function due to cirrhosis\nThis patient group has not been studied. The doses above may be used in mild and moderate \nimpairment but close monitoring is advised as the doses may need readjustment.\n\nPatients with renal impairment\n\nSome patients with moderately or severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min) \nmay have increased eribulin exposure and may need a reduction of the dose. For all patients with renal \nimpairment, caution and close safety monitoring is advised. (See section 5.2)\n\nElderly patients\n\nNo specific dose adjustments are recommended based on the age of the patient (see section 4.8).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere is no relevant use of HALAVEN in children and adolescents for the indication of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n4\n\nThe safety and efficacy of HALAVEN in children from birth to 18 years of age have not yet been \nestablished in soft tissue sarcoma. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nHALAVEN is for intravenous use. The dose may be diluted in up to 100 ml of sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. It should not be diluted in glucose 5% infusion solution. For \ninstructions on the dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. Good \nperipheral venous access, or a patent central line, should be ensured prior to administration. There is \nno evidence that eribulin mesilate is a vesicant or an irritant. In the event of extravasation, treatment \nshould be symptomatic. For information relevant to the handling of cytotoxic medicinal products see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n- Breast-feeding\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaematology\n\nMyelosuppression is dose dependent and primarily manifested as neutropenia (section 4.8). \nMonitoring of complete blood counts should be performed on all patients prior to each dose of \neribulin. Treatment with eribulin should only be initiated in patients with ANC values ≥ 1.5 x 109/l and \nplatelets > 100 x 109/l.\n\nFebrile neutropenia occurred in < 5% of patients treated with eribulin. Patients experiencing febrile \nneutropenia, severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, should be treated according to the \nrecommendations in section 4.2.\n\nPatients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3 x upper limit of \nnormal (ULN) experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. \nAlthough data are limited, patients with bilirubin >1.5 x ULN also have a higher incidence of Grade 4 \nneutropenia and febrile neutropenia. \n\nFatal cases of febrile neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis, sepsis and septic shock have been reported.\n\nSevere neutropenia may be managed by the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or \nequivalent at the physician’s discretion in accordance with relevant guidelines (see section 5.1).\n\nPeripheral neuropathy\n\nPatients should be closely monitored for signs of peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy. The \ndevelopment of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a delay or reduction of dose (see section 4.2)\n\nIn clinical trials, patients with pre-existing neuropathy greater than Grade 2 were excluded. However, \npatients with pre-existing neuropathy Grade 1 or 2 were no more likely to develop new or worsening \nsymptoms than those who entered the study without the condition.\n\nQT prolongation\n\nIn an uncontrolled open-label ECG study in 26 patients, QT prolongation was observed on Day 8, \nindependent of eribulin concentration, with no QT prolongation observed on Day 1. ECG monitoring \nis recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias or\nconcomittant treatment with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia \nand III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia or \n\n\n\n5\n\nhypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to initiating HALAVEN and these electrolytes should be \nmonitored periodically during therapy. Eribulin should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT \nsyndrome.\n\nExcipients\n\nThis medicinal product contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEribulin is mainly (up to 70%) eliminated through biliary excretion. The transport protein involved in \nthis process is unknown. Eribulin is not a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic \nanion (OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3), multi-drug resistance-associated protein (MRP2, \nMRP4) and bile salt export pump (BSEP) transporters.\n\nNo drug-drug interactions are expected with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. Eribulin exposure \n(AUC and Cmax) was unaffected by ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and P glycoprotein (Pgp) inhibitor, and \nrifampicin, a CYP3A4 inducer.\n\nEffects of eribulin on the pharmacokinetics of other medicines\n\nIn vitro data indicate that eribulin is a mild inhibitor of the important drug metabolising enzyme \nCYP3A4. No in vivo data are available. Caution and monitoring for adverse events is recommended \nwith concomitant use of substances that have a narrow therapeutic window and that are eliminated \nmainly via CYP3A4-mediated metabolism (eg alfentanil, cyclosporine, ergotamine, fentanyl, \npimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus).\n\nEribulin does not inhibit the CYP enzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 2E1 at relevant \nclinical concentrations.\n\nAt relevant clinical concentrations, eribulin did not inhibit BCRP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, \nOATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter-mediated activity.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of eribulin in pregnant women. Eribulin is embryotoxic, foetotoxic, and \nteratogenic in rats. HALAVEN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after \na careful consideration of the needs of the mother and the risk to the foetus.\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid becoming pregnant whilst they or their \nmale partner are receiving HALAVEN and have to use effective contraception during and up to 3 \nmonths after treatment.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether eribulin/metabolites are excreted in human or animal breast milk. A risk to \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded and therefore HALAVEN must not be used during \nbreast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n\nFertility\n\nTesticular toxicity has been observed in rats and dogs (see section 5.3). Male patients should seek \nadvice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility \ndue to therapy with HALAVEN.\n\n\n\n6\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nHALAVEN may cause adverse reactions such as tiredness and dizziness which may lead to minor or \nmoderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive or \nuse machines if they feel tired or dizzy.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions related to HALAVEN, are bone marrow suppression \nmanifested as neutropenia, leucopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia with associated infections. New \nonset or worsening of pre-existing peripheral neuropathy has also been reported. Gastrointestinal \ntoxicities, manifested as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and stomatitis are among \nreported undesirable effects. Other undesirable effects include fatigue, alopecia, increased liver \nenzymes, sepsis and musculoskeletal pain syndrome.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the table shows the incidence rates of adverse reactions observed in breast \ncancer and soft tissue sarcoma patients who received the recommended dose in Phase 2 and Phase 3 \nstudies. \n\nFrequency categories are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000). \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing frequency. \nWhere Grade 3 or 4 reactions occurred, the actual total frequency and the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 \nreactions are given.

\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nNeutropenia\nThe neutropenia observed was reversible and not cumulative; the mean time to nadir was 13 days and \nthe mean time to recovery from severe neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/l) was 8 days.\nNeutrophil counts of < 0.5 x 109/l that lasted for more than 7 days occurred in 13% of breast cancer \npatients treated with eribulin in the EMBRACE study.\nNeutropenia was reported as a Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) in 151/404 (37.4% for all \ngrades) in the sarcoma population, compared with 902/1559 (57.9% for all grades) in the breast cancer \n\n\n\n9\n\npopulation. The combined grouped TEAE and neutrophil laboratory abnormality frequencies were \n307/404 (76.0%) and 1314/1559 (84.3%), respectively. The median duration of treatment was 12.0 \nweeks for sarcoma patients and 15.9 weeks for breast cancer patients.\nFatal cases of febrile neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis, sepsis and septic shock have been reported. Out \nof 1963 breast cancer and soft tissue sarcoma patients who received eribulin at the recommended dose \nin clinical trials there was one fatal event each of neutropenic sepsis (0.1%) and febrile neutropenia\n(0.1%). In addition there were 3 fatal events of sepsis (0.2%) and one of septic shock (0.1%).\nSevere neutropenia may be managed by the use of G-CSF or equivalent at the physician’s discretion in \naccordance with relevant guidelines. 18% and 13% of eribulin treated patients received G-CSF in the \ntwo phase 3 breast cancer studies (Studies 305 and 301, respectively). In the phase 3 sarcoma study \n(Study 309), 26% of the eribulin treated patients received G-CSF.\nNeutropenia resulted in discontinuation in < 1% of patients receiving eribulin.\n\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation\nCases of disseminated intravascular coagulation have been reported, typically in association with \nneutropenia and/or sepsis.\n\nPeripheral neuropathy\nIn the 1559 breast cancer patients the most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of \ntreatment with eribulin was peripheral neuropathy (3.4%). The median time to Grade 2 peripheral \nneuropathy was 12.6 weeks (post 4 cycles). Out of the 404 sarcoma patients, 2 patients discontinued \ntreatment with eribulin due to peripheral neuropathy. The median time to Grade 2 peripheral \nneuropathy was 18.4 weeks.\nDevelopment of Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 7.4% of breast cancer patients and \n3.5% of sarcoma patients. In clinical trials, patients with pre-existing neuropathy were as likely to \ndevelop new or worsening symptoms as those who entered the study without the condition.\nIn breast cancer patients with pre-existing Grade 1 or 2 peripheral neuropathy the frequency of \ntreatment-emergent Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 14%.\n\nHepatotoxicity\nIn some patients with normal/abnormal liver enzymes prior treatment with eribulin, increased levels of \nliver enzymes have been reported with initiation of eribulin treatment. Such elevations appeared to \nhave occurred early with eribulin treatment in cycle 1 – 2 for the majority of these patients and whilst\nthought likely to be a phenomenon of adaptation to eribulin treatment by the liver and not a sign of \nsignificant liver toxicity in most patients, hepatotoxicity has also been reported.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly population\nOf the 1559 breast cancer patients treated with the recommended dose of eribulin, 283 patients\n(18.2%) were ≥ 65 years of age. In the 404 sarcoma patient population, 90 patients (22.3%) treated \nwith eribulin were ≥ 65 years of age. The safety profile of eribulin in elderly patients (≥ 65 years of \nage) was similar to that of patients <65 years of age except for asthenia/fatigue which showed an \nincreasing trend with age. No dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly population.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\nPatients with ALT or AST > 3 x ULN experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and \nfebrile neutropenia. Although data are limited, patients with bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN also have a higher \nincidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (see also sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn one case of overdose the patient inadvertently received 7.6 mg of eribulin (approximately 4 times \nthe planned dose) and subsequently developed a hypersensitivity reaction (Grade 3) on Day 3 and \nneutropenia (Grade 3) on Day 7. Both adverse reactions resolved with supportive care.\n\nThere is no known antidote for eribulin overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be \nclosely monitored. Management of overdose should include supportive medical interventions to treat \nthe presenting clinical manifestations.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX41\n\nEribulin mesilate is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor belonging to the halichondrin class of \nantineoplastic agents. It is a structurally simplified synthetic analogue of halichondrin B, a natural \nproduct isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai.\n\nEribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and \nsequesters tubulin into non-productive aggregates. Eribulin exerts its effects via a tubulin-based \nantimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, \nultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged and irreversible mitotic blockage.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nBreast cancer\n\nThe efficacy of HALAVEN in breast cancer is primarily supported by two randomized Phase 3 \ncomparative studies. \nThe 762 patients in the pivotal Phase 3 EMBRACE study (Study 305) had locally recurrent or \nmetastatic breast cancer, and had previously received at least two and a maximum of five \nchemotherapy regimens, including an anthracycline and a taxane (unless contraindicated). Patients \nmust have progressed within 6 months of their last chemotherapeutic regimen. The HER2 status of the \npatients was: 16.1% positive, 74.2% negative and 9.7% unknown, whilst 18.9% of patients were triple \nnegative. They were randomized 2:1 to receive either HALAVEN, or treatment of physician’s choice \n(TPC), which consisted of 97% chemotherapy (26% vinorelbine, 18% gemcitabine, 18% capecitabine, \n16% taxane, 9% anthracycline, 10% other chemotherapy), or 3% hormonal therapy.\nThe study met its primary endpoint with an overall survival (OS) result that was statistically \nsignificantly better in the eribulin group compared to TPC at 55% of events. \nThis result was confirmed with an updated overall survival analysis carried out at 77% of events.\n\n\n\n11\n\nStudy 305 - Updated Overall Survival ( ITT Population)\n\nP\nR\n\nO\nP\n\nO\nR\n\nT\nIO\n\nN\n O\n\nF\n P\n\nA\nT\n\nIE\nN\n\nT\nS\n\n A\nL\n\nIV\nE\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\nTIME (months)\n\nNUMBER OF PATIENTS AT RISK\n\nHALAVEN 508 406 274 142 54 11 0\n\nTPC 254 178 106 61 26 5 0\n\nBy independent review, the median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.7 months for eribulin \ncompared to 2.2 months for the TPC arm (HR 0.865, 95% CI: 0.714, 1.048, p=0.137). In response \nevaluable patients, the objective response rate by the RECIST criteria was 12.2% (95% CI: 9.4%, \n15.5%) by independent review for the eribulin arm compared to 4.7% (95% CI: 2.3%, 8.4%) for the\nTPC arm.\n\nThe positive effect on OS was seen in both taxane-refractory and non-refractory groups of patients . In \nthe OS update, the HR for eribulin versus TPC was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.14) in favour of eribulin for \ntaxane-refractory patients and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.96) for patients not taxane-refractory. \n\nThe positive effect on OS was seen both in capecitabine-naïve and in capecitabine pre-treated patient \ngroups. The updated OS analysis showed a survival benefit for the eribulin group compared to TPC \nboth in capecitabine pre-treated patients with a HR of 0.787 (95% CI: 0.645, 0.961), and for the \ncapecitabine-naïve patients with a corresponding HR of 0.865 (95% CI: 0.606, 1.233). \n\nThe second Phase 3 study in earlier line metastatic breast cancer, Study 301, was an open-label, \nrandomized, study in patients (n=1102) with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer to \ninvestigate the efficacy of HALAVEN monotherapy compared to capecitabine monotherapy in terms \nof OS and PFS as co-primary endpoint. Patients had previously received up to three prior \nchemotherapy regimens, including both an anthracycline and a taxane and a maximum of two for \nadvanced disease, with the percentage who had received 0, 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy treatments for \nmetastatic breast cancer being 20.0%, 52.0% or 27.2% respectively.

Patients had received at least two \nprior chemotherapy regimens, one of which must have been an anthracycline (unless contraindicated).\n\nPatients must have progressed within 6 months of their last chemotherapeutic regimen. They were \nrandomized 1:1 to receive either eribulin 1.23 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle or dacarbazine \n850 mg/m2, 1000 mg/m2 or 1200 mg/m2 (dose determined by the investigator prior to randomization), \nevery 21 days.\n\nIn Study 309, a statistically significant improvement in OS was observed in patients randomized to the \neribulin arm compared to the control arm.

See section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nDistribution\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of eribulin are characterized by a rapid distribution phase followed by a \nprolonged elimination phase, with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 40 h. It has a large \nvolume of distribution (range of means 43 to 114 l/m2). \n\nEribulin is weakly bound to plasma proteins. The plasma protein binding of eribulin (100-1000 ng/ml) \nranged from 49% to 65% in human plasma. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nUnchanged eribulin was the major circulating species in plasma following administration of 14C-\neribulin to patients. Metabolite concentrations represented <0.6% of parent compound, confirming that \nthere are no major human metabolites of eribulin.\n\nElimination\n\nEribulin has a low clearance (range of means 1.16 to 2.42 l/h/m2). No significant accumulation of \neribulin is observed on weekly administration. The pharmacokinetic properties are not dose or time \ndependent in the range of eribulin doses of 0.22 to 3.53 mg/m2. \n\nEribulin is eliminated primarily by biliary excretion. The transport protein involved in the excretion is \npresently unknown. Preclinical in vitro studies indicate that eribulin is transported by Pgp. However it \nhas been shown that at clinically relevant concentrations eribulin is not a Pgp inhibitor in vitro. \nAdditionally, in vivo, concomitant administration of ketoconazole, a Pgp inhibitor, has no effect on \neribulin exposure (AUC and Cmax). In vitro studies have also indicated that eribulin is not a substrate \nfor OCT1.\n\nAfter administration of 14C-eribulin to patients, approximately 82% of the dose was eliminated in \nfaeces and 9% in urine indicating that renal clearance is not a significant route of eribulin elimination.\n\nUnchanged eribulin represented most of the total radioactivity in faeces and urine.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nA study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of eribulin in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A; n=7) and \nmoderate (Child-Pugh B; n=4) hepatic impairment due to liver metastases. Compared to patients with \nnormal hepatic function (n=6), eribulin exposure increased 1.8-fold and 3-fold in patients with mild \nand moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. Administration of HALAVEN at a dose of 0.97 mg/m2\n\nto patients with mild hepatic impairment and 0.62 mg/m2 to patients with moderate hepatic impairment \nresulted in a somewhat higher exposure than after a dose of 1.23 mg/m2 to patients with normal \nhepatic function. HALAVEN was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nC). There is no study in patients with hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis. See section 4.2 for dosage \nrecommendation.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nIncreased eribulin exposure was seen in some patients with moderately or severely impaired renal \nfunction, with high between-subject variability. The pharmacokinetics of eribulin were evaluated in a \nPhase 1 study in patients with normal renal function (Creatinine clearance: ≥ 80 ml/min; n=6), \n\n\n\n16\n\nmoderate (30-50 ml/min; n=7) or severe (15-<30 ml/min; n=6) renal impairment. Creatinine clearance \nwas estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula. A 1.5-fold (90% CI: 0.9-2.5) higher dose-normalised \nAUC(0-inf) was observed in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. See section 4.2 for \ntreatment recommendations.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nEribulin was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test). Eribulin was \npositive in the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay and was clastogenic in the in vivo rat \nmicronucleus assay. \n\nNo carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with eribulin.\n\nA fertility study was not conducted with eribulin, but based on non-clinical findings in repeated-dose \nstudies where testicular toxicity was observed in both rats (hypocellularity of seminiferous epithelium \nwith hypospermia/aspermia) and dogs, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with eribulin.\nAn embryofoetal development study in rat confirmed the developmental toxicity and teratogenic \npotential of eribulin. Pregnant rats were treated with eribulin mesilate equivalent to 0.009, 0.027, \n0.088 and 0.133 mg/kg eribulin at gestation days 8, 10 and 12. Dose related increased number of \nresorptions and decreased foetal weight were observed at doses ≥ 0.088 mg/kg and increased incidence \nof malformations (absence of lower jaw, tongue, stomach and spleen) was recorded at 0.133 mg/kg.\n\n6.
