NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRiprazo 150 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nLight-pink, biconvex, round tablet, imprinted \u201cIL\u201d on one side and \u201cNVR\u201d on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Riprazo is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks (85-90%) after initiating therapy \n\nwith 150 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nRiprazo may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents with the exception of \n\nuse in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Riprazo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of Riprazo with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly patients aged 65 years and over \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \n\nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Riprazo in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established. No \n\ndata are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Riprazo should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Riprazo (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n- History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n \n\n- Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n- The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-gp \n\ninhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Riprazo therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \n\nHeart Association [NYHA] functional class III-IV). \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin system, \n\nangioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) \n\nhave been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Riprazo should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nSodium and/or volume depleted patients \n\nIn patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. those receiving high doses of diuretics) \n\nsymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Riprazo. This condition should \n\nbe corrected prior to administration of Riprazo, or the treatment should start under close medical \n\nsupervision. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn clinical studies Riprazo has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (serum creatinine \u2265 150 \u03bcmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \u2265 177 \u03bcmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \n\nmen and/or estimated GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or \n\nrenovascular hypertension. Riprazo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as \n\nhypovolaemia (eg. due to blood loss, severe prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart \n\ndisease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and \n\nACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\nAcute renal failure, reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients \n\nreceiving aliskiren in post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, \n\naliskiren should be promptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and \n\nthese may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic determination \n\nof renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is considered necessary. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Riprazo in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal products \n\nacting on the renin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including \n\nacute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore, \n\ncaution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\nDual RAAS blockade \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\nGrapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \n\nCo-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is \n\nlikely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by \n\ngrapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, \n\ngrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Riprazo. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\nP-gp interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced \n\naliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John\u2019s \n\nwort) might decrease the bioavailability of Riprazo. Although this has not been investigated for \n\naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp \n\ninhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may \n\nincrease tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will \n\nlikely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \n\nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination \n\nof aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal \n\nimpairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-\n\nhypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated \n\npatients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further \n\ndeterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. \n\nTherefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nFurosemide \n\nWhen aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced \n\nby 28% and 49%, respectively. It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when \n\ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible under-utilisation in clinical situations of \n\nvolume overload. \n\n \n\nWarfarin \n\nThe effects of Riprazo on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nFood interactions \n\nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of Riprazo substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (\u219328%), amlodipine (\u219129%) or cimetidine \n\n(\u219119%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Riprazo. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state Riprazo AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of Riprazo had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for Riprazo or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Riprazo. \n\n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Riprazo \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John\u2019s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of Riprazo. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Riprazo was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, \n\nRiprazo should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become \n\npregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). Healthcare \n\nprofessionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAAS should counsel women of childbearing \n\npotential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during \n\ntherapy, Riprazo should be discontinued accordingly. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Riprazo was secreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats. Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nRiprazo has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when driving \n\nvehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness may occasionally \n\noccur when taking Riprazo. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nRiprazo has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for \n\nover 6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse reactions showed no \n\nassociation with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Serious adverse reactions include \n\nanaphylactic reaction and angioedema which have been reported in post-marketing experience and \n\nmay occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). The most common adverse reaction is \n\ndiarrhoea. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, \n\nusing the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n\n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data).

A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers \n\n(ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLaboratory findings \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \n\nuncommonly associated with the administration of Riprazo. In clinical studies in hypertensive \n\npatients, Riprazo had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \n\ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\n\nangiotensin system, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nLimited data are available related to overdose in humans. The most likely manifestations of \n\noverdosage would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; renin inhibitor, ATC \n\ncode: C09XA02 \n\n \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin \n\nII. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)) \n\ncause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in \n\nhypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was \n\ncombined with other antihypertensive agents. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on \n\nPRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Riprazo at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \n\nethnicity. Riprazo has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n\n75 years or older. \n\n \n\nRiprazo monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes \n\nof antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB. Compared to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide - \n\nHCTZ), Riprazo 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to \n\n14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for Riprazo added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \n\ntolerated. Riprazo induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel \n\nblocker amlodipine, the addition of Riprazo 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to \n\nthat obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren \n\n150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%). \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (\u2265 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% \u2265 75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \n\nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \n\nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \n\nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with \n\nRiprazo 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on \n\ntreatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with Riprazo alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. With cessation of treatment, blood \n\npressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence \n\nof a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nPreliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of \n\nplacebo (95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of \n\nserious adverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications \n\n(4.7% versus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and \n\nstroke (2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with \n\nrenal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nBeneficial effects of Riprazo on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are \n\ncurrently unknown. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRiprazo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC0-\n\ntau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with \n\nthe initial dose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \n\nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \n\nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the mean plasma clearance is \n\napproximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \n\nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dosage of Riprazo is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Riprazo is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of Riprazo with \n\nARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nLight-red, biconvex, ovaloid tablet, imprinted \u201cIU\u201d on one side and \u201cNVR\u201d on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Riprazo is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks (85-90%) after initiating therapy \n\nwith 150 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nRiprazo may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents with the exception of \n\nuse in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Riprazo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of Riprazo with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly patients aged 65 years and over \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \n\nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Riprazo in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established. No \n\ndata are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Riprazo should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Riprazo (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n- History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n \n\n- Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n \n\n- Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n- The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-gp \n\ninhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Riprazo therapy should be stopped (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \n\nHeart Association [NYHA] functional class III-IV). \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin system, \n\nangioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) \n\nhave been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Riprazo should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nSodium and/or volume depleted patients \n\nIn patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. those receiving high doses of diuretics) \n\nsymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Riprazo. This condition should \n\nbe corrected prior to administration of Riprazo, or the treatment should start under close medical \n\nsupervision. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn clinical studies Riprazo has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (serum creatinine \u2265 150 \u03bcmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \u2265 177 \u03bcmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \n\nmen and/or estimated GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or \n\nrenovascular hypertension. Riprazo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nAs for other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as \n\nhypovolaemia (eg. due to blood loss, severe prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart \n\ndisease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and \n\nACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\nAcute renal failure, reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients \n\nreceiving aliskiren in post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, \n\naliskiren should be promptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and \n\nthese may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic determination \n\nof renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is considered necessary. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Riprazo in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other medicinal products \n\nacting on the renin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including \n\nacute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore, \n\ncaution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\nDual RAAS blockade \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\nGrapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \n\nCo-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is \n\nlikely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by \n\ngrapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, \n\ngrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Riprazo. \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\nP-gp interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced \n\naliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John\u2019s \n\nwort) might decrease the bioavailability of Riprazo. Although this has not been investigated for \n\naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp \n\ninhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may \n\nincrease tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will \n\nlikely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \n\nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination \n\nof aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal \n\nimpairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-\n\nhypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated \n\npatients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further \n\ndeterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. \n\nTherefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nFurosemide \n\nWhen aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced \n\nby 28% and 49%, respectively. It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when \n\ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible under-utilisation in clinical situations of \n\nvolume overload. \n\n \n\nWarfarin \n\nThe effects of Riprazo on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nFood interactions \n\nMeals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of Riprazo substantially \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNo interactions \n\n- Compounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. No interactions have been identified. \n\n \n\n- Co-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (\u219328%), amlodipine (\u219129%) or cimetidine \n\n(\u219119%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Riprazo. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin, steady-state Riprazo AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-\n\nadministration of Riprazo had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine \n\npharmacokinetics. As a result no dose adjustment for Riprazo or these co-administered \n\nmedicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\n- Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Riprazo. \n\n \n\n- CYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\n- P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Riprazo \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John\u2019s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of Riprazo. \n\n \n\n- Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Riprazo was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, \n\nRiprazo should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become \n\npregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). Healthcare \n\nprofessionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAAS should counsel women of childbearing \n\npotential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during \n\ntherapy, Riprazo should be discontinued accordingly. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Riprazo was secreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats. Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nRiprazo has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when driving \n\nvehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness may occasionally \n\noccur when taking Riprazo. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nRiprazo has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for \n\nover 6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse reactions showed no \n\nassociation with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Serious adverse reactions include \n\nanaphylactic reaction and angioedema which have been reported in post-marketing experience and \n\nmay occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). The most common adverse reaction is \n\ndiarrhoea. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n\nThe adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, \n\nusing the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n\n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data).

A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers \n\n(ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nLaboratory findings \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \n\nuncommonly associated with the administration of Riprazo. In clinical studies in hypertensive \n\npatients, Riprazo had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \n\ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\n\nangiotensin system, such as ACEIs and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\nLimited data are available related to overdose in humans. The most likely manifestations of \n\noverdosage would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; renin inhibitor, ATC \n\ncode: C09XA02 \n\n \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin \n\nII. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)) \n\ncause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in \n\nhypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was \n\ncombined with other antihypertensive agents. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on \n\nPRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Riprazo at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \n\nethnicity. Riprazo has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n\n75 years or older. \n\n \n\nRiprazo monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes \n\nof antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB. Compared to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide - \n\nHCTZ), Riprazo 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to \n\n14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for Riprazo added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \n\ntolerated. Riprazo induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel \n\nblocker amlodipine, the addition of Riprazo 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to \n\nthat obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren \n\n150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%). \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (\u2265 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% \u2265 75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \n\nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \n\nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \n\nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with \n\nRiprazo 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on \n\ntreatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with Riprazo alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. With cessation of treatment, blood \n\npressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence \n\nof a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nPreliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of \n\nplacebo (95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of \n\nserious adverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications \n\n(4.7% versus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and \n\nstroke (2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with \n\nrenal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nBeneficial effects of Riprazo on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are \n\ncurrently unknown. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nRiprazo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC0-\n\ntau by 67% in hypertensive patients. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with \n\nthe initial dose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \n\nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \n\nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the mean plasma clearance is \n\napproximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \n\nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dosage of Riprazo is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Riprazo is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of Riprazo with \n\nARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Riprazo is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nRiprazo tablets contain an active substance called aliskiren. Aliskiren belongs to a class of medicines \n\ncalled renin inhibitors. Riprazo helps to lower high blood pressure in adult patients. Renin inhibitors \n\nreduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can produce. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to \n\ntighten, which increases the blood pressure. Reducing the amount of angiotensin II allows the blood \n\nvessels to relax, which lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \n\nof developing these disorders. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Riprazo \n\n \n\nDo not take Riprazo \n\n- if you are allergic to aliskiren or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).

medicines called renin inhibitors. riprazo helps to lower high blood pressure in adult patients. renin inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin ii the body can produce. angiotensin ii causes blood vessels to tighten, which increases the blood pressure. reducing the amount of angiotensin ii allows the blood vessels to relax, which lowers blood pressure. high blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. if this continues for a long time, it can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart failure, heart attack or kidney failure. lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk of developing these disorders.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "riprazo", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,
