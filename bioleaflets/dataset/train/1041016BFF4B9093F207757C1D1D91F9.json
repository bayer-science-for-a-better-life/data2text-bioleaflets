NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRebif 22 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe (0.5 mL) contains 22 micrograms (6 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a**. \n \n* Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in-house \ninterferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard \n(GB-23-902-531). \n** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO-K1) by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect: Contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.5 mL. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \nClear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.5 to 4.5 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was \ncharacterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). \n \nEfficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without \nongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nRebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients \ninitiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a pack \nthat corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous \ninjection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, \nis recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. \n \nWhen first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow \ntachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions. The Rebif initiation package corresponds to \nthe patient needs for the first month of treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records \nin children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in \n\n\n\n3 \n\nchildren (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or \n44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif \nshould not be used in this age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after \neach injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif \nadministration. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with \nRebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should \nbe evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and \na decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating \nphysician. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\u2022 Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nPatients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta \nadministration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend \nto be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued \ntreatment. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to \nseveral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include \nthrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, \nparesis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased \nplatelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes \n(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, \nfurther testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If \nTMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate \ndiscontinuation of Rebif is recommended. \n \nDepression and suicidal ideation \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in \nparticular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \nideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \n\n\n\n4 \n\nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report \nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation \nof therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSeizure disorders \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving \ntreatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nantiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac disease \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. \nSymptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to \npatients with cardiac conditions. \n \nInjection site necrosis \n \nInjection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise \nthe risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\u2022 use an aseptic injection technique, \n\u2022 rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred.  \n \nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before \ncontinuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until \nhealing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too \nextensive. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \n \nIn clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic \ntransaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, \nserum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy \nand periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times \nthe ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated \nwith caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver \ndisease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be \nstopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. \n \nRebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic \nfailure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six \nmonths of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No \nspecific risk factors have been identified. \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNephrotic syndrome \n \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \n\n\n\n5 \n\nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those \nlaboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme \nmonitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at \nregular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically \nthereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  \n \nThyroid disorders \n \nPatients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. \nThyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following \ninitiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be \nperformed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression \n \nCaution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to \npatients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \nNeutralising antibodies \n \nSerum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of \nantibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with \nRebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to \ninterferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic \nresponse to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance \nof the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies \nis associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to \ntherapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the \nbenefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. \n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity \nlimits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. \n \nOther forms of multiple sclerosis \n \nOnly sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple \nsclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis \nand should not be used in these patients. \n \nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nBenzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nAdvise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, \nwhich might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might \naccumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. \n \nThe interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been \nstudied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was \ndetected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very \nlimited. \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \nIf clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \nRebif can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta \n(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like \nsyndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in \nfrequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to \nexperience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. \nApproximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild \ninflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and \ndecreases in white blood cells are also common. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, \nand respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of \nRebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post-\nmarketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post-marketing \nsurveillance). The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nRare: Thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopenic \n\npurpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome* (class label for interferon beta \nproducts, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* \n\n \nEndocrine disorders \nUncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or \n\nhyperthyroidism  \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare:  Anaphylactic reactions*  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Asymptomatic transaminase increase \nCommon: Severe elevations in transaminases \nUncommon: Hepatitis with or without icterus* \nRare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis*  \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression, insomnia  \nRare: Suicide attempt* \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nUncommon: Seizures*  \nFrequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, \n\nparaesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may \nmimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations*  \n\n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of \n\nretinal artery or vein)* \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Thromboembolic events* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea* \nFrequency not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see \n\nbelow Pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, maculo-papular rash, alopecia* \nUncommon: Urticaria* \nRare: Quincke\u2019s oedema (angio-oedema)*, erythema multiforme*, erythema \n\nmultiforme-like skin reactions*, Stevens Johnson syndrome* \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective disorders \nCommon: Myalgia, arthralgia \nRare: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRare: Nephrotic syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza-like symptoms \nCommon: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever \nUncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection \n\nsite infections*, increased sweating* \nRare: Injection site cellulitis* \nFrequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nLimited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) \nreceiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nClass effects \n \nThe administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, \nvasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  \nAn increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 \n \nInterferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and \nantiproliferative properties. \n \nRebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human \ninterferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore \nglycosylated like the natural protein. \n \nRegardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the \nadministration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2\u20195\u2019OAS synthetase \nand serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to \ndecline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable \nresponses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological \nresponses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. \n \nBiological response markers (e.g., 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are \ninduced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer \nsubjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours \nfor neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2\u20195\u2019OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and \nOAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after \nfirst and sixth administration. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \nsclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously \nthree times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease \nthe incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at \nleast 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of \npatients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed \nthree months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nreduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and \n29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated \nwith placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. \n \nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nIn a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence \nof clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the \npreceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was \nreduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and \nthose without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in \npatients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at \nthe end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and \n44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be \ninterpreted cautiously. \n \nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nRebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should \nnot be used in these patients.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp \nmulti-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular \nadministrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  \n \nDistribution \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum \nconcentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) \nincreased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated \napparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple \ndosing. \n \nMetabolism \nInterferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nRebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. \n \nA study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An \nincreased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No \ninformation is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRebif is indicated for the treatment of  \n\u2022 patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative \n\ndiagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing \nclinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) \n\n\u2022 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or \nmore acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). \n\n \nEfficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without \nongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nRebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients \ninitiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a pack \nthat corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. \n \nPosology \n \nWhen first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing \nadverse reactions it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously \nand the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following \nschedule: \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n Recommended \nTitration \n\n(% of final dose) \n\nTitration dose for Rebif \n44 micrograms \n\nthree times per week (tiw) \nWeeks 1-2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 3\u20134 50% 22 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 5+ 100% 44 micrograms tiw \n\n \nFirst demyelinating event \nThe posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif \ngiven three times per week by subcutaneous injection.  \n \nRelapsing multiple sclerosis \nThe recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous \ninjection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, \nis recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records \nin children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in \nchildren (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or \n44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif \nshould not be used in this age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after \neach injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif \nadministration. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with \nRebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should \nbe evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and \na decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating \nphysician. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\u2022 Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nPatients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta \nadministration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend \n\n\n\n15 \n\nto be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued \ntreatment. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to \nseveral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include \nthrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, \nparesis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased \nplatelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes \n(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, \nfurther testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If \nTMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate \ndiscontinuation of Rebif is recommended. \n \nDepression and suicidal ideation \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in \nparticular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \nideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report \nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation \nof therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSeizure disorders \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving \ntreatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nantiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac disease \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. \nSymptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to \npatients with cardiac conditions. \n \nInjection site necrosis \n \nInjection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise \nthe risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\u2022 use an aseptic injection technique, \n\u2022 rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred.  \n \nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before \ncontinuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until \nhealing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too \nextensive. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nHepatic dysfunction \n \nIn clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic \ntransaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, \nserum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy \nand periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times \nthe ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated \nwith caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver \ndisease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be \nstopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. \n \nRebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic \nfailure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six \nmonths of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No \nspecific risk factors have been identified. \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNephrotic syndrome \n \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. The overall incidence of these is \nslightly higher with Rebif 44 than Rebif 22 micrograms. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory \ntests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and \ncomplete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals \n(1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the \nabsence of clinical symptoms. These should be more frequent when initiating Rebif 44 micrograms. \n \nThyroid disorders \n \nPatients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. \nThyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following \ninitiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be \nperformed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression \n \nCaution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to \npatients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \nNeutralising antibodies \n \nSerum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of \nantibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with \nRebif 44 micrograms, approximately 13 to 14% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to \ninterferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic \n\n\n\n17 \n\nresponse to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance \nof the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies \nis associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to \ntherapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the \nbenefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. \n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity \nlimits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. \n \nOther forms of multiple sclerosis \n \nOnly sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple \nsclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis \nand should not be used in these patients. \n \nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nBenzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nAdvise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, \nwhich might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might \naccumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. \n \nThe interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been \nstudied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was \ndetected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very \nlimited. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \nIf clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \nRebif can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta \n(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like \nsyndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in \nfrequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to \nexperience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. \nApproximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild \ninflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and \ndecreases in white blood cells are also common. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, \nand respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of \nRebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post-\nmarketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post-marketing \nsurveillance). The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nRare: Thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopenic \n\npurpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome* (class label for interferon beta \nproducts, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* \n\n \nEndocrine disorders \nUncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or \n\nhyperthyroidism  \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nImmune system disorders \nRare:  Anaphylactic reactions*  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Asymptomatic transaminase increase \nCommon: Severe elevations in transaminases \nUncommon: Hepatitis with or without icterus* \nRare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis*  \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression, insomnia  \nRare: Suicide attempt* \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nUncommon: Seizures*  \nFrequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, \n\nparaesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may \nmimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations*  \n\n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of \n\nretinal artery or vein)* \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Thromboembolic events* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea* \nFrequency not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see \n\nbelow Pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, maculo-papular rash, alopecia* \nUncommon: Urticaria* \nRare: Quincke\u2019s oedema (angio-oedema)*, erythema multiforme*, erythema \n\nmultiforme-like skin reactions*, Stevens Johnson syndrome* \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective disorders \nCommon: Myalgia, arthralgia \nRare: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRare: Nephrotic syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza-like symptoms \nCommon: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever \nUncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection \n\nsite infections*, increased sweating* \nRare: Injection site cellulitis* \nFrequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nLimited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) \nreceiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nClass effects \n \nThe administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, \nvasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  \nAn increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 \n \nInterferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and \nantiproliferative properties. \n \nRebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human \ninterferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore \nglycosylated like the natural protein. \n \nRegardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the \nadministration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2\u20195\u2019OAS synthetase \nand serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to \ndecline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable \nresponses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological \nresponses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. \n \nBiological response markers (e.g., 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are \ninduced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer \nsubjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours \nfor neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2\u20195\u2019OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and \nOAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after \nfirst and sixth administration. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21 \n\n \nThe precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. \n \nSingle clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis \n \nOne 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event \nsuggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least \ntwo clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of \nwhich is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could \nbetter explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  \n \nPatients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times \nper week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event \noccurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of \nRebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to \ninitial randomisation. \n \nEfficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this \nstudy are as follows: \n \n\nParameter \nStatistics \n\nTreatment Treatment Comparison \nRebif 44 mcg tiw versus Placebo \n\nPlacebo  \n(n=171) \n\nRebif 44 \nmcg tiw \n(n=171) \n\nRisk \nReduction \n\nCox\u2019s \nProportional \nHazard Ratio \n\n[95% CI] \n\nLog-Rank \np-value \n\nMcDonald (2005) Conversion \nNumber of events 144 106  \n\n51% \n \n\n0.49 [0.38;0.64] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 85.8% 62.5% \nCDMS Conversion \nNumber of events 60 33  \n\n52% \n \n\n0.48 [0.31;0.73] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% \nMean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period \nLeast Square Means \n(SE) \n\n \n2.59 (0.30) \n\n \n0.50 (0.06) \n\n \n81% \n\n \n0.19 [0.14;0.26]* \n\n \n<0.001 \n\ntiw: three times per week, CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active \n* Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] \n \nFor the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more \nconservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least \none new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the \ninitial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \nsclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously \nthree times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 44 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease \nthe incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at \nleast 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of \npatients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed \nthree months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 27% (Rebif 44 micrograms). Over 4 years, the \nreduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and \n29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated \nwith placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nIn a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence \nof clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the \npreceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was \nreduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and \nthose without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in \npatients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at \nthe end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and \n44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be \ninterpreted cautiously. \n \nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nRebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should \nnot be used in these patients.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp \nmulti-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular \nadministrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  \n \nDistribution \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum \nconcentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) \nincreased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated \napparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple \ndosing. \n \nMetabolism \nInterferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nRebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. \n \nA study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An \nincreased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No \ninformation is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRebif is indicated for the treatment of  \n\u2022 patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative \n\ndiagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing \nclinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) \n\n\u2022 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or \nmore acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). \n\n \nEfficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without \nongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPosology \n \nThe Rebif initiation package corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. When \nfirst starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse \nreactions, it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the \ndose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: \n \n\n Recommended \nTitration \n\n(% of final dose) \n\nTitration dose for Rebif \n44 micrograms \n\nthree times per week (tiw) \nWeeks 1-2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 3\u20134 50% 22 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 5+ 100% 44 micrograms tiw \n\n \nPaediatric population \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records \nin children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in \nchildren (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or \n44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif \nshould not be used in this age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after \neach injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif \nadministration. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with \nRebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should \nbe evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and \na decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating \nphysician. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\u2022 Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nPatients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta \nadministration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend \nto be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued \ntreatment. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to \nseveral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include \nthrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, \nparesis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased \nplatelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes \n(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, \nfurther testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If \nTMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate \ndiscontinuation of Rebif is recommended. \n \nDepression and suicidal ideation \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in \nparticular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \nideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report \nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation \nof therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSeizure disorders \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving \ntreatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nantiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac disease \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. \nSymptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to \npatients with cardiac conditions. \n \nInjection site necrosis \n \nInjection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise \nthe risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\u2022 use an aseptic injection technique, \n\u2022 rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred.  \n \nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before \ncontinuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until \nhealing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too \nextensive. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \n \nIn clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic \n\n\n\n28 \n\ntransaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, \nserum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy \nand periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times \nthe ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated \nwith caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver \ndisease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be \nstopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. \n \nRebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic \nfailure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six \nmonths of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No \nspecific risk factors have been identified. \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNephrotic syndrome \n \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those \nlaboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme \nmonitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at \nregular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically \nthereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  \n \nThyroid disorders \n \nPatients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. \nThyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following \ninitiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be \nperformed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression \n \nCaution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to \npatients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \nNeutralising antibodies \n \nSerum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of \nantibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with \nRebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to \ninterferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic \nresponse to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance \nof the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies \nis associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to \ntherapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the \nbenefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity \nlimits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. \n \nOther forms of multiple sclerosis \n \nOnly sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple \nsclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis \nand should not be used in these patients. \n \nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nBenzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nAdvise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, \nwhich might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might \naccumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. \n \nThe interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been \nstudied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was \ndetected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very \nlimited. \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nIf clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \nRebif can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta \n(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like \nsyndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in \nfrequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to \nexperience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. \nApproximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild \ninflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and \ndecreases in white blood cells are also common. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, \nand respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of \nRebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post-\nmarketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post-marketing \nsurveillance). The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nRare: Thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopenic \n\npurpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome* (class label for interferon beta \nproducts, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* \n\n \nEndocrine disorders \nUncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or \n\nhyperthyroidism  \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare:  Anaphylactic reactions*  \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Asymptomatic transaminase increase \nCommon: Severe elevations in transaminases \nUncommon: Hepatitis with or without icterus* \nRare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis*  \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression, insomnia  \nRare: Suicide attempt* \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nUncommon: Seizures*  \nFrequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, \n\nparaesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may \nmimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations*  \n\n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of \n\nretinal artery or vein)* \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Thromboembolic events* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea* \nFrequency not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see \n\nbelow Pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, maculo-papular rash, alopecia* \nUncommon: Urticaria* \nRare: Quincke\u2019s oedema (angio-oedema)*, erythema multiforme*, erythema \n\nmultiforme-like skin reactions*, Stevens Johnson syndrome* \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective disorders \nCommon: Myalgia, arthralgia \nRare: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRare: Nephrotic syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza-like symptoms \nCommon: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever \nUncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection \n\nsite infections*, increased sweating* \nRare: Injection site cellulitis* \nFrequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nLimited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) \nreceiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nClass effects \n \nThe administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, \nvasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  \nAn increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 \n \nInterferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and \nantiproliferative properties. \n \nRebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human \ninterferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore \nglycosylated like the natural protein. \n \nRegardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the \nadministration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2\u20195\u2019OAS synthetase \nand serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to \ndecline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable \nresponses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological \nresponses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. \n \nBiological response markers (e.g., 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are \ninduced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer \nsubjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours \nfor neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2\u20195\u2019OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and \nOAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after \nfirst and sixth administration. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n33 \n\n \nThe precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. \n \nSingle clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis \n \nOne 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event \nsuggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least \ntwo clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of \nwhich is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could \nbetter explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  \n \nPatients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times \nper week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event \noccurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of \nRebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to \ninitial randomisation. \n \nEfficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this \nstudy are as follows: \n \n\nParameter \nStatistics \n\nTreatment Treatment Comparison \nRebif 44 mcg tiw versus Placebo \n\nPlacebo  \n(n=171) \n\nRebif 44 \nmcg tiw \n(n=171) \n\nRisk \nReduction \n\nCox\u2019s \nProportional \nHazard Ratio \n\n[95% CI] \n\nLog-Rank \np-value \n\nMcDonald (2005) Conversion \nNumber of events 144 106  \n\n51% \n \n\n0.49 [0.38;0.64] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 85.8% 62.5% \nCDMS Conversion \nNumber of events 60 33  \n\n52% \n \n\n0.48 [0.31;0.73] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% \nMean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period \nLeast Square Means \n(SE) \n\n \n2.59 (0.30) \n\n \n0.50 (0.06) \n\n \n81% \n\n \n0.19 [0.14;0.26]* \n\n \n<0.001 \n\ntiw: three times per week, CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active \n* Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] \n \nFor the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more \nconservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least \none new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the \ninitial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \nsclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously \nthree times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease \nthe incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at \nleast 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of \npatients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed \nthree months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the \nreduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and \n29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated \nwith placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nIn a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence \nof clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the \npreceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was \nreduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and \nthose without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in \npatients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at \nthe end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and \n44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be \ninterpreted cautiously. \n \nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nRebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should \nnot be used in these patients.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp \nmulti-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular \nadministrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  \n \nDistribution \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum \nconcentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) \nincreased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated \napparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple \ndosing. \n \nMetabolism \nInterferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nRebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. \n \nA study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An \nincreased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No \ninformation is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRebif 22 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in cartridge \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled cartridge contains 66 micrograms (18 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a** in 1.5 mL \nsolution, corresponding to 44 micrograms/mL. \n \n* Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in-house \ninterferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard \n(GB-23-902-531). \n** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO-K1) by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect: Contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.5 mL. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in cartridge. \nClear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.7 to 4.1 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was \ncharacterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). \n \nEfficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without \nongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous \ninjection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, \nis recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. \n \nWhen first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow \ntachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions. The Rebif initiation package corresponds to \nthe patient needs for the first month of treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records \nin children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in \nchildren (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or \n44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif \nshould not be used in this age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRebif solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge is intended for multidose use with the \nRebiSmart electronic injection device following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. \n \nFor administration, the instructions provided in the package leaflet and in the instruction manual \n(Instructions for Use) provided with RebiSmart should be followed. \n \nPrior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised \nto decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with \nRebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should \nbe evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and \na decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating \nphysician. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\u2022 Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nPatients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta \nadministration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend \nto be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued \ntreatment. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to \nseveral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include \nthrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, \nparesis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased \nplatelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes \n(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, \nfurther testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If \nTMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate \ndiscontinuation of Rebif is recommended. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nDepression and suicidal ideation \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in \nparticular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \nideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report \nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation \nof therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSeizure disorders \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving \ntreatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nantiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac disease \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. \nSymptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to \npatients with cardiac conditions. \n \nInjection site necrosis \n \nInjection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise \nthe risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\u2022 use an aseptic injection technique, \n\u2022 rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred.  \n \nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before \ncontinuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until \nhealing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too \nextensive. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \n \nIn clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic \ntransaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, \nserum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy \nand periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times \nthe ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated \nwith caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver \ndisease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be \nstopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. \n \nRebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic \nfailure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six \nmonths of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No \nspecific risk factors have been identified. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNephrotic syndrome \n \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those \nlaboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme \nmonitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at \nregular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically \nthereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  \n \nThyroid disorders \n \nPatients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. \nThyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following \ninitiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be \nperformed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression \n \nCaution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to \npatients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \nNeutralising antibodies \n \nSerum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of \nantibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with \nRebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to \ninterferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic \nresponse to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance \nof the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies \nis associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to \ntherapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the \nbenefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. \n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity \nlimits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. \n \nOther forms of multiple sclerosis \n \nOnly sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple \nsclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis \nand should not be used in these patients. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nBenzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nAdvise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, \nwhich might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might \naccumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. \n \nThe interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been \nstudied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was \ndetected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very \nlimited. \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \nIf clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \n \nRebif can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta \n(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like \nsyndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in \nfrequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70 % of patients treated with Rebif can expect to \nexperience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. \nApproximately 30 % of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild \ninflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and \ndecreases in white blood cells are also common. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, \nand respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of \nRebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post-\nmarketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post-marketing \nsurveillance). The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nRare: Thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopenic \n\npurpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome* (class label for interferon beta \nproducts, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* \n\n \nEndocrine disorders \nUncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or \n\nhyperthyroidism  \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare:  Anaphylactic reactions*  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Asymptomatic transaminase increase \nCommon: Severe elevations in transaminases \nUncommon: Hepatitis with or without icterus* \nRare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression, insomnia  \nRare: Suicide attempt* \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nUncommon: Seizures* \nFrequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, \n\nparaesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may \nmimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations*  \n\n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of \n\nretinal artery or vein)* \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Thromboembolic events* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea* \nFrequency not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see \n\nbelow Pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, maculo-papular rash, alopecia* \nUncommon: Urticaria* \nRare: Quincke\u2019s oedema (angio-oedema)*, erythema multiforme*, erythema \n\nmultiforme-like skin reactions*, Stevens Johnson syndrome* \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective disorders \nCommon: Myalgia, arthralgia \nRare: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRare: Nephrotic syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza-like symptoms \nCommon: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever \nUncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection \n\nsite infections*, increased sweating* \nRare: Injection site cellulitis* \nFrequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nLimited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) \nreceiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nClass effects \n \nThe administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, \nvasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  \nAn increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 \n \nInterferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and \nantiproliferative properties. \n \nRebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human \ninterferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore \nglycosylated like the natural protein. \n \nRegardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the \nadministration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2\u20195\u2019OAS synthetase \nand serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to \ndecline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable \nresponses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological \nresponses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. \n \nBiological response markers (e.g., 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are \ninduced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer \nsubjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours \nfor neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2\u20195\u2019OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and \nOAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after \nfirst and sixth administration. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \nsclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously \nthree times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease \nthe incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at \nleast 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of \npatients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed \nthree months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n45 \n\nreduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and \n29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated \nwith placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. \n \nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nIn a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence \nof clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the \npreceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was \nreduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and \nthose without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in \npatients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at \nthe end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and \n44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be \ninterpreted cautiously. \n \nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nRebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should \nnot be used in these patients.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp \nmulti-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular \nadministrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  \n \nDistribution \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum \nconcentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) \nincreased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated \napparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple \ndosing. \n \nMetabolism \nInterferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nRebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. \n \nA study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An \nincreased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No \ninformation is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n6.

In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or \nmore acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). \n\n \nEfficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without \nongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nFor patients initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are \navailable in a pack that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy.  \n \nPosology \n \nWhen first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing \nadverse reactions it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously \nand the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following \nschedule: \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n Recommended \nTitration \n\n(% of final dose) \n\nTitration dose for Rebif \n44 micrograms \n\nthree times per week (tiw) \nWeeks 1-2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 3\u20134 50% 22 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 5+ 100% 44 micrograms tiw \n\n \nFirst demyelinating event \nThe posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif \ngiven three times per week by subcutaneous injection.  \n \nRelapsing multiple sclerosis \nThe recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous \ninjection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, \nis recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist.  \n \nPaediatric population \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records \nin children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in \nchildren (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or \n44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif \nshould not be used in this age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRebif solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge is intended for multidose use with the \nRebiSmart electronic injection device following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. \n \nFor administration, the instructions provided in the package leaflet and in the instruction manual \n(Instructions for Use) provided with RebiSmart should be followed. \n \nPrior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised \nto decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with \nRebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should \nbe evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and \na decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating \nphysician. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\u2022 Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nGeneral recommendations \n \nPatients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta \nadministration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend \nto be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued \ntreatment. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to \nseveral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include \nthrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, \nparesis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased \nplatelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes \n(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, \nfurther testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If \nTMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate \ndiscontinuation of Rebif is recommended. \n \nDepression and suicidal ideation \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in \nparticular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \nideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report \nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation \nof therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSeizure disorders \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving \ntreatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nantiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac disease \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. \nSymptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to \npatients with cardiac conditions. \n \nInjection site necrosis \n \nInjection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise \nthe risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\u2022 use an aseptic injection technique, \n\u2022 rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred.  \n \nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before \ncontinuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until \n\n\n\n51 \n\nhealing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too \nextensive. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \n \nIn clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic \ntransaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, \nserum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy \nand periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times \nthe ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated \nwith caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver \ndisease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be \nstopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. \n \nRebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic \nfailure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six \nmonths of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No \nspecific risk factors have been identified. \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNephrotic syndrome \n \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons.  The overall incidence of these is \nslightly higher with Rebif 44 than Rebif 22 micrograms. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory \ntests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and \ncomplete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals \n(1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the \nabsence of clinical symptoms. These should be more frequent when initiating Rebif 44 micrograms. \n \nThyroid disorders \n \nPatients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. \nThyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following \ninitiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be \nperformed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression \n \nCaution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to \npatients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nNeutralising antibodies \n \nSerum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of \nantibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with \nRebif 44 micrograms, approximately 13 to 14% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to \ninterferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic \nresponse to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance \nof the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies \nis associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to \ntherapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the \nbenefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. \n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity \nlimits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. \n \nOther forms of multiple sclerosis \n \nOnly sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple \nsclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis \nand should not be used in these patients. \n \nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nBenzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nAdvise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, \nwhich might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might \naccumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. \n \nThe interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been \nstudied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was \ndetected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very \nlimited. \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \nIf clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \n \nRebif can be used during breast-feeding.   \n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta \n(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like \nsyndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in \nfrequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70 % of patients treated with Rebif can expect to \nexperience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. \nApproximately 30 % of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild \ninflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and \ndecreases in white blood cells are also common. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, \nand respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of \nRebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post-\nmarketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post-marketing \nsurveillance). The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nRare: Thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopenic \n\npurpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome* (class label for interferon beta \nproducts, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* \n\n \nEndocrine disorders \nUncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or \n\nhyperthyroidism  \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare:  Anaphylactic reactions*  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Asymptomatic transaminase increase \nCommon: Severe elevations in transaminases \nUncommon: Hepatitis with or without icterus* \nRare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression, insomnia  \nRare: Suicide attempt* \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nUncommon: Seizures* \nFrequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, \n\nparaesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may \nmimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations*  \n\n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of \n\nretinal artery or vein)* \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Thromboembolic events* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea* \nFrequency not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see \n\nbelow Pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, maculo-papular rash, alopecia* \nUncommon: Urticaria* \nRare: Quincke\u2019s oedema (angio-oedema)*, erythema multiforme*, erythema \n\nmultiforme-like skin reactions*, Stevens Johnson syndrome* \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective disorders \nCommon: Myalgia, arthralgia \nRare: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRare: Nephrotic syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza-like symptoms \nCommon: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever \nUncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection \n\nsite infections*, increased sweating* \nRare: Injection site cellulitis* \nFrequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nLimited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) \nreceiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nClass effects \n \nThe administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, \nvasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  \nAn increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be given. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n56 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 \n \nInterferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and \nantiproliferative properties. \n \nRebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human \ninterferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore \nglycosylated like the natural protein. \n \nRegardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the \nadministration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2\u20195\u2019OAS synthetase \nand serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to \ndecline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable \nresponses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological \nresponses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. \n \nBiological response markers (e.g., 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are \ninduced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer \nsubjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours \nfor neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2\u20195\u2019OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and \nOAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after \nfirst and sixth administration. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. \n \nSingle clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis \n \nOne 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event \nsuggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least \ntwo clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of \nwhich is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could \nbetter explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  \n \nPatients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times \nper week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event \noccurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of \nRebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to \ninitial randomisation.  \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nEfficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this \nstudy are as follows: \n \n\nParameter \nStatistics \n\nTreatment Treatment Comparison \nRebif 44 mcg tiw versus Placebo \n\nPlacebo  \n(n=171) \n\nRebif 44 \nmcg tiw \n(n=171) \n\nRisk \nReduction \n\nCox\u2019s \nProportional \nHazard Ratio \n\n[95% CI] \n\nLog-Rank \np-value \n\nMcDonald (2005) Conversion \nNumber of events 144 106  \n\n51% \n \n\n0.49 [0.38;0.64] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 85.8% 62.5% \nCDMS Conversion \nNumber of events 60 33  \n\n52% \n \n\n0.48 [0.31;0.73] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% \nMean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period \nLeast Square Means \n(SE) \n\n \n2.59 (0.30) \n\n \n0.50 (0.06) \n\n \n81% \n\n \n0.19 [0.14;0.26]* \n\n \n<0.001 \n\ntiw: three times per week, CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active \n* Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] \n \nFor the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more \nconservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least \none new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the \ninitial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \nsclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously \nthree times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 44 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease \nthe incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at \nleast 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of \npatients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed \nthree months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 27% (Rebif 44 micrograms). Over 4 years, the \nreduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and \n29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated \nwith placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. \n \nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nIn a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence \nof clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the \npreceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was \nreduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and \nthose without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in \npatients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at \nthe end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and \n44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be \ninterpreted cautiously. \n \nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nRebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should \nnot be used in these patients.  \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp \nmulti-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular \nadministrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  \n \nDistribution \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum \nconcentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) \nincreased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated \napparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple \ndosing. \n \nMetabolism \nInterferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nRebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. \n \nA study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An \nincreased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No \ninformation is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled cartridge contains 132 micrograms (36 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a** in 1.5 mL \nsolution, corresponding to 88 micrograms/mL. \n \n* Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in-house \ninterferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard \n(GB-23-902-531). \n** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO-K1) by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect: Contains 0.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.1 mL and 1.25 mg benzyl \nalcohol per dose of 0.25 mL. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in cartridge. \nClear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.7 to 4.1 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRebif is indicated for the treatment of  \n\u2022 patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative \n\ndiagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing \nclinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) \n\n\u2022 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or \nmore acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). \n\n \nEfficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without \nongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nPosology \n \nThe Rebif initiation package corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. When \nfirst starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse \nreactions, it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the \ndose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\n Recommended \nTitration \n\n(% of final dose) \n\nTitration dose for Rebif \n44 micrograms \n\nthree times per week (tiw) \nWeeks 1-2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 3-4 50% 22 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 5+ 100% 44 micrograms tiw \n\n \nPaediatric population \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records \nin children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in \nchildren (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or \n44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif \nshould not be used in this age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRebif solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge is intended for multidose use with the \nRebiSmart electronic injection device following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. \n \nFor administration, the instructions provided in the package leaflet and in the instruction manual \n(Instructions for Use) provided with RebiSmart should be followed. \n \nPrior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised \nto decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with \nRebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should \nbe evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and \na decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating \nphysician. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\u2022 Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nPatients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta \nadministration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend \nto be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued \ntreatment. \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to \nseveral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include \nthrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, \nparesis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased \nplatelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes \n(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, \nfurther testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If \nTMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate \ndiscontinuation of Rebif is recommended. \n \nDepression and suicidal ideation \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in \nparticular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \nideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report \nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation \nof therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSeizure disorders \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving \ntreatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nantiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac disease \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. \nSymptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to \npatients with cardiac conditions. \n \nInjection site necrosis \n \nInjection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise \nthe risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\u2022 use an aseptic injection technique, \n\u2022 rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred.  \n \nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before \ncontinuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until \nhealing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too \nextensive. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \n \nIn clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic \n\n\n\n63 \n\ntransaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, \nserum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy \nand periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times \nthe ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated \nwith caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver \ndisease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be \nstopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. \n \nRebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic \nfailure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six \nmonths of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No \nspecific risk factors have been identified. \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNephrotic syndrome \n \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those \nlaboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme \nmonitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at \nregular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically \nthereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  \n \nThyroid disorders \n \nPatients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. \nThyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following \ninitiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be \nperformed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression \n \nCaution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to \npatients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \nNeutralising antibodies \n \nSerum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of \nantibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with \nRebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to \ninterferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic \nresponse to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance \nof the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies \nis associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to \ntherapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the \nbenefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity \nlimits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. \n \nOther forms of multiple sclerosis \n \nOnly sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple \nsclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis \nand should not be used in these patients. \n \nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nBenzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nAdvise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, \nwhich might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might \naccumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. \n \nThe interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been \nstudied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was \ndetected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very \nlimited. \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nIf clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \n \nRebif can be used during breast-feeding.   \n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta \n(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like \nsyndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in \nfrequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70 % of patients treated with Rebif can expect to \nexperience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. \nApproximately 30 % of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild \ninflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and \ndecreases in white blood cells are also common. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, \nand respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of \nRebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post-\nmarketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post-marketing \nsurveillance). The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nRare: Thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopenic \n\npurpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome* (class label for interferon beta \nproducts, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* \n\n \nEndocrine disorders \nUncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or \n\nhyperthyroidism  \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare:  Anaphylactic reactions*  \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Asymptomatic transaminase increase \nCommon: Severe elevations in transaminases \nUncommon: Hepatitis with or without icterus* \nRare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression, insomnia  \nRare: Suicide attempt* \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nUncommon: Seizures* \nFrequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, \n\nparaesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may \nmimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations*  \n\n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of \n\nretinal artery or vein)* \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Thromboembolic events* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea* \nFrequency not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see \n\nbelow Pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, maculo-papular rash, alopecia* \nUncommon: Urticaria* \nRare: Quincke\u2019s oedema (angio-oedema)*, erythema multiforme*, erythema \n\nmultiforme-like skin reactions*, Stevens Johnson syndrome* \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective disorders \nCommon: Myalgia, arthralgia \nRare: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRare: Nephrotic syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza-like symptoms \nCommon: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever \nUncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection \n\nsite infections*, increased sweating* \nRare: Injection site cellulitis* \nFrequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nLimited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) \nreceiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nClass effects \n \nThe administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, \nvasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  \nAn increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 \n \nInterferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and \nantiproliferative properties. \n \nRebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human \ninterferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore \nglycosylated like the natural protein. \n \nRegardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the \nadministration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2\u20195\u2019OAS synthetase \nand serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to \ndecline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable \nresponses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological \nresponses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. \n \nBiological response markers (e.g., 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are \ninduced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer \nsubjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours \nfor neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2\u20195\u2019OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and \nOAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after \nfirst and sixth administration. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n68 \n\n \nThe precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. \n \nSingle clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis \n \nOne 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event \nsuggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least \ntwo clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of \nwhich is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could \nbetter explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  \n \nPatients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times \nper week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event \noccurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of \nRebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to \ninitial randomisation.  \n \nEfficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this \nstudy are as follows: \n \n\nParameter \nStatistics \n\nTreatment Treatment Comparison \nRebif 44 mcg tiw versus Placebo \n\nPlacebo  \n(n=171) \n\nRebif 44 \nmcg tiw \n(n=171) \n\nRisk \nReduction \n\nCox\u2019s \nProportional \nHazard Ratio \n\n[95% CI] \n\nLog-Rank \np-value \n\nMcDonald (2005) Conversion \nNumber of events 144 106  \n\n51% \n \n\n0.49 [0.38;0.64] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 85.8% 62.5% \nCDMS Conversion \nNumber of events 60 33  \n\n52% \n \n\n0.48 [0.31;0.73] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% \nMean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period \nLeast Square Means \n(SE) \n\n \n2.59 (0.30) \n\n \n0.50 (0.06) \n\n \n81% \n\n \n0.19 [0.14;0.26]* \n\n \n<0.001 \n\ntiw: three times per week, CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active \n* Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] \n \nFor the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more \nconservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least \none new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the \ninitial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \nsclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously \nthree times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease \nthe incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at \nleast 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of \npatients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed \nthree months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the \nreduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and \n29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated \nwith placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nIn a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence \nof clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the \npreceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was \nreduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and \nthose without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in \npatients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at \nthe end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and \n44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be \ninterpreted cautiously. \n \nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nRebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should \nnot be used in these patients.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp \nmulti-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular \nadministrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  \n \nDistribution \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum \nconcentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) \nincreased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated \napparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple \ndosing. \n \nMetabolism \nInterferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nRebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. \n \nA study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An \nincreased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No \ninformation is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRebif 22 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 22 micrograms (6 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a** in 0.5 mL solution. \n \n* Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in-house \ninterferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard \n(GB-23-902-531). \n** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO-K1) by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect: Contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.5 mL. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled pen. \nClear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.5 to 4.5 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was \ncharacterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). \n \nEfficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without \nongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nRebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients \ninitiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a \npackage that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous \ninjection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, \nis recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. \n \nWhen first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow \ntachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions. The Rebif initiation package corresponds to \nthe patient needs for the first month of treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records \nin children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in \n\n\n\n73 \n\nchildren (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or \n44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif \nshould not be used in this age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRebiDose is a ready to use pre-filled pen for subcutaneous injection. It is intended for single use and \nshould only be used following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. \n \nFor administration of Rebif with RebiDose, the instructions provided in the package leaflet should be \nfollowed. \n \nPrior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised \nto decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with \nRebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should \nbe evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and \na decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating \nphysician. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\u2022 Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGeneral recommendations \n \nPatients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta \nadministration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend \nto be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued \ntreatment. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to \nseveral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include \nthrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, \nparesis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased \nplatelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes \n(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, \nfurther testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If \nTMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate \ndiscontinuation of Rebif is recommended. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nDepression and suicidal ideation \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in \nparticular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \nideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report \nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation \nof therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSeizure disorders \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving \ntreatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nantiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac disease \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. \nSymptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to \npatients with cardiac conditions. \n \nInjection site necrosis \n \nInjection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise \nthe risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\u2022 use an aseptic injection technique, \n\u2022 rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred.  \n \nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before \ncontinuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until \nhealing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too \nextensive. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \n \nIn clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic \ntransaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, \nserum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy \nand periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times \nthe ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated \nwith caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver \ndisease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be \nstopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. \n \nRebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic \nfailure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six \nmonths of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No \nspecific risk factors have been identified. \n \n\n\n\n75 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNephrotic syndrome \n \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those \nlaboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme \nmonitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at \nregular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically \nthereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  \n \nThyroid disorders \n \nPatients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. \nThyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following \ninitiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be \nperformed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression \n \nCaution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to \npatients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \nNeutralising antibodies \n \nSerum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of \nantibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with \nRebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to \ninterferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic \nresponse to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance \nof the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies \nis associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to \ntherapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the \nbenefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. \n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity \nlimits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. \n \nOther forms of multiple sclerosis \n \nOnly sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple \nsclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis \nand should not be used in these patients. \n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nBenzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nAdvise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, \nwhich might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might \naccumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. \n \nThe interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been \nstudied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was \ndetected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very \nlimited. \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \nIf clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \n \nRebif can be used during breast-feeding.   \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta \n(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like \nsyndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in \nfrequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to \nexperience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. \nApproximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild \ninflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and \ndecreases in white blood cells are also common. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, \nand respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of \nRebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post-\nmarketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post-marketing \nsurveillance). The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nRare: Thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopenic \n\npurpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome* (class label for interferon beta \nproducts, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* \n\n \nEndocrine disorders \nUncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or \n\nhyperthyroidism  \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare:  Anaphylactic reactions*  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Asymptomatic transaminase increase \nCommon: Severe elevations in transaminases \nUncommon: Hepatitis with or without icterus* \nRare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression, insomnia  \nRare: Suicide attempt* \n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nUncommon: Seizures* \nFrequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, \n\nparaesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may \nmimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations*  \n\n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of \n\nretinal artery or vein)* \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Thromboembolic events* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea* \nFrequency not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see \n\nbelow Pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, maculo-papular rash, alopecia* \nUncommon: Urticaria* \nRare: Quincke\u2019s oedema (angio-oedema)*, erythema multiforme*, erythema \n\nmultiforme-like skin reactions*, Stevens Johnson syndrome* \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective disorders \nCommon: Myalgia, arthralgia \nRare: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRare: Nephrotic syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza-like symptoms \nCommon: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever \nUncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection \n\nsite infections*, increased sweating* \nRare: Injection site cellulitis* \nFrequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nLimited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) \nreceiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nClass effects \n \nThe administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, \nvasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  \nAn increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 \n \nInterferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and \nantiproliferative properties. \n \nRebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human \ninterferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore \nglycosylated like the natural protein. \n \nRegardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the \nadministration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2\u20195\u2019OAS synthetase \nand serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to \ndecline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable \nresponses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological \nresponses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. \n \nBiological response markers (e.g., 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are \ninduced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer \nsubjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours \nfor neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2\u20195\u2019OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and \nOAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after \nfirst and sixth administration. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \nsclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously \nthree times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease \nthe incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at \nleast 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of \npatients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed \nthree months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n80 \n\nreduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and \n29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated \nwith placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. \n \nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nIn a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence \nof clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the \npreceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was \nreduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and \nthose without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in \npatients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at \nthe end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and \n44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be \ninterpreted cautiously. \n \nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nRebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should \nnot be used in these patients.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp \nmulti-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular \nadministrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  \n \nDistribution \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum \nconcentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) \nincreased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated \napparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple \ndosing. \n \nMetabolism \nInterferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nRebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. \n \nA study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An \nincreased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No \ninformation is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRebif is indicated for the treatment of  \n\u2022 patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative \n\ndiagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing \nclinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) \n\n\u2022 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or \nmore acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). \n\n \nEfficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without \nongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nRebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients \ninitiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a \npackage that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. \n \nPosology \n \nWhen first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing \nadverse reactions it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously \nand the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following \nschedule: \n \n\n\n\n84 \n\n Recommended \nTitration \n\n(% of final dose) \n\nTitration dose for Rebif \n44 micrograms \n\nthree times per week (tiw) \nWeeks 1-2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 3\u20134 50% 22 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 5+ 100% 44 micrograms tiw \n\n \nFirst demyelinating event \nThe posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif \ngiven three times per week by subcutaneous injection.  \n \nRelapsing multiple sclerosis \nThe recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous \ninjection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, \nis recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist.  \n \nPaediatric population \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records \nin children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in \nchildren (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or \n44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif \nshould not be used in this age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRebiDose is a ready to use pre-filled pen for subcutaneous injection. It is intended for single use and \nshould only be used following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. \n \nFor administration of Rebif with RebiDose, the instructions provided in the package leaflet should be \nfollowed. \n \nPrior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised \nto decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with \nRebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should \nbe evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and \na decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating \nphysician. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\u2022 Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n\n\n\n85 \n\nGeneral recommendations \n \nPatients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta \nadministration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend \nto be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued \ntreatment. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to \nseveral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include \nthrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, \nparesis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased \nplatelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes \n(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, \nfurther testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If \nTMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate \ndiscontinuation of Rebif is recommended. \n \nDepression and suicidal ideation \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in \nparticular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \nideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report \nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation \nof therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSeizure disorders \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving \ntreatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nantiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac disease \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. \nSymptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to \npatients with cardiac conditions. \n \nInjection site necrosis \n \nInjection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise \nthe risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\u2022 use an aseptic injection technique, \n\u2022 rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred.  \n \nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before \ncontinuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until \n\n\n\n86 \n\nhealing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too \nextensive. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \n \nIn clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic \ntransaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, \nserum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy \nand periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times \nthe ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated \nwith caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver \ndisease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be \nstopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. \n \nRebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic \nfailure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six \nmonths of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No \nspecific risk factors have been identified. \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNephrotic syndrome \n \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. The overall incidence of these is \nslightly higher with Rebif 44 than Rebif 22 micrograms. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory \ntests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and \ncomplete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals \n(1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the \nabsence of clinical symptoms. These should be more frequent when initiating Rebif 44 micrograms. \n \nThyroid disorders \n \nPatients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. \nThyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following \ninitiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be \nperformed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression \n \nCaution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to \npatients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nNeutralising antibodies \n \nSerum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of \nantibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with \nRebif 44 micrograms, approximately 13 to 14% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to \ninterferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic \nresponse to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance \nof the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies \nis associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to \ntherapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the \nbenefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. \n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity \nlimits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. \n \nOther forms of multiple sclerosis \n \nOnly sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple \nsclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis \nand should not be used in these patients. \n \nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nBenzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nAdvise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, \nwhich might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might \naccumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. \n \nThe interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been \nstudied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \n\n\n\n88 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was \ndetected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very \nlimited. \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \nIf clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \n \nRebif can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta \n(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like \nsyndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in \nfrequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to \nexperience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. \nApproximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild \ninflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and \ndecreases in white blood cells are also common. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, \nand respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of \nRebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. \n \n\n\n\n89 \n\nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post-\nmarketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post-marketing \nsurveillance). The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nRare: Thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopenic \n\npurpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome* (class label for interferon beta \nproducts, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* \n\n \nEndocrine disorders \nUncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or \n\nhyperthyroidism  \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare:  Anaphylactic reactions*  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Asymptomatic transaminase increase \nCommon: Severe elevations in transaminases \nUncommon: Hepatitis with or without icterus* \nRare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression, insomnia  \nRare: Suicide attempt* \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nUncommon: Seizures* \nFrequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, \n\nparaesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may \nmimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations*  \n\n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of \n\nretinal artery or vein)* \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Thromboembolic events* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea* \nFrequency not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see \n\nbelow Pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n \n\n\n\n90 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, maculo-papular rash, alopecia* \nUncommon: Urticaria* \nRare: Quincke\u2019s oedema (angio-oedema)*, erythema multiforme*, erythema \n\nmultiforme-like skin reactions*, Stevens Johnson syndrome* \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective disorders \nCommon: Myalgia, arthralgia \nRare: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRare: Nephrotic syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza-like symptoms \nCommon: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever \nUncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection \n\nsite infections*, increased sweating* \nRare: Injection site cellulitis* \nFrequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nLimited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) \nreceiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nClass effects \n \nThe administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, \nvasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  \nAn increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be given. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n91 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 \n \nInterferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and \nantiproliferative properties. \n \nRebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human \ninterferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore \nglycosylated like the natural protein. \n \nRegardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the \nadministration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2\u20195\u2019OAS synthetase \nand serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to \ndecline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable \nresponses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological \nresponses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. \n \nBiological response markers (e.g., 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are \ninduced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer \nsubjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours \nfor neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2\u20195\u2019OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and \nOAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after \nfirst and sixth administration. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. \n \nSingle clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis \n \nOne 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event \nsuggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least \ntwo clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of \nwhich is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could \nbetter explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  \n \nPatients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times \nper week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event \noccurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of \nRebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to \ninitial randomisation.  \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\nEfficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this \nstudy are as follows: \n \n\nParameter \nStatistics \n\nTreatment Treatment Comparison \nRebif 44 mcg tiw versus Placebo \n\nPlacebo  \n(n=171) \n\nRebif 44 \nmcg tiw \n(n=171) \n\nRisk \nReduction \n\nCox\u2019s \nProportional \nHazard Ratio \n\n[95% CI] \n\nLog-Rank \np-value \n\nMcDonald (2005) Conversion \nNumber of events 144 106  \n\n51% \n \n\n0.49 [0.38;0.64] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 85.8% 62.5% \nCDMS Conversion \nNumber of events 60 33  \n\n52% \n \n\n0.48 [0.31;0.73] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% \nMean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period \nLeast Square Means \n(SE) \n\n \n2.59 (0.30) \n\n \n0.50 (0.06) \n\n \n81% \n\n \n0.19 [0.14;0.26]* \n\n \n<0.001 \n\ntiw: three times per week, CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active \n* Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] \n\n \nFor the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more \nconservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least \none new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the \ninitial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \nsclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously \nthree times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 44 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease \nthe incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at \nleast 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of \npatients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed \nthree months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 27% (Rebif 44 micrograms). Over 4 years, the \nreduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and \n29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated \nwith placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. \n \nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nIn a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence \nof clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the \npreceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was \nreduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and \nthose without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in \npatients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at \nthe end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and \n44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be \ninterpreted cautiously. \n \nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nRebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should \nnot be used in these patients.  \n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp \nmulti-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular \nadministrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  \n \nDistribution \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum \nconcentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) \nincreased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated \napparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple \ndosing. \n \nMetabolism \nInterferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nRebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. \n \nA study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An \nincreased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No \ninformation is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRebif is indicated for the treatment of  \n\u2022 patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative \n\ndiagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing \nclinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) \n\n\u2022 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or \nmore acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). \n\n \nEfficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without \nongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \n\n\n\n96 \n\nPosology \n \nThe Rebif initiation packs correspond to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. When first \nstarting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse \nreactions, it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the \ndose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: \n \n\n Recommended \nTitration \n\n(% of final dose) \n\nTitration dose for Rebif \n44 micrograms \n\nthree times per week (tiw) \nWeeks 1-2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 3\u20134 50% 22 micrograms tiw \nWeeks 5+ 100% 44 micrograms tiw \n\n \nPaediatric population \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records \nin children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in \nchildren (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or \n44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif \nshould not be used in this age group. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRebiDose is a ready to use pre-filled pen for subcutaneous injection. It is intended for single use and \nshould only be used following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. \n \nFor administration of Rebif with RebiDose, the instructions provided in the package leaflet should be \nfollowed. \n \nPrior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised \nto decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with \nRebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should \nbe evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and \na decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating \nphysician. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in \n\nsection 6.1. \n\u2022 Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n\n\n\n97 \n\nGeneral recommendations \n \nPatients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta \nadministration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend \nto be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued \ntreatment. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to \nseveral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include \nthrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, \nparesis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased \nplatelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes \n(erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, \nfurther testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If \nTMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate \ndiscontinuation of Rebif is recommended. \n \nDepression and suicidal ideation \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in \nparticular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal \nideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \nassociation with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report \nany symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting \ndepression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation \nof therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nSeizure disorders \n \nRebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving \ntreatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nantiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nCardiac disease \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. \nSymptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to \npatients with cardiac conditions. \n \nInjection site necrosis \n \nInjection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise \nthe risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n\u2022 use an aseptic injection technique, \n\u2022 rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred.  \n \nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before \ncontinuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until \n\n\n\n98 \n\nhealing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too \nextensive. \n \nHepatic dysfunction \n \nIn clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic \ntransaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, \nserum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy \nand periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times \nthe ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated \nwith caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver \ndisease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be \nstopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. \n \nRebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic \nfailure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six \nmonths of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No \nspecific risk factors have been identified. \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNephrotic syndrome \n \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon-beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those \nlaboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme \nmonitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at \nregular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically \nthereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  \n \nThyroid disorders \n \nPatients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. \nThyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following \ninitiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be \nperformed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression \n \nCaution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to \npatients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \nNeutralising antibodies \n \nSerum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of \nantibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with \n\n\n\n99 \n\nRebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to \ninterferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic \nresponse to interferon beta-1a (beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance \nof the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies \nis associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to \ntherapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the \nbenefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. \n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity \nlimits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. \n \nOther forms of multiple sclerosis \n \nOnly sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple \nsclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis \nand should not be used in these patients. \n \nExcipients \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nBenzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nMonitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. \n \nAdvise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, \nwhich might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might \naccumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. \n \nThe interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been \nstudied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was \n\n\n\n100 \n\ndetected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very \nlimited. \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \nIf clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \n \nRebif can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta \n(e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like \nsyndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in \nfrequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to \nexperience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. \nApproximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild \ninflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and \ndecreases in white blood cells are also common. \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, \nand respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of \nRebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. \n \nList of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post-\nmarketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post-marketing \nsurveillance). The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nBlood and the lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nRare: Thrombotic microangiopathy including thrombotic thrombocytopenic \n\npurpura/haemolytic uraemic syndrome* (class label for interferon beta \nproducts, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* \n\n \n\n\n\n101 \n\nEndocrine disorders \nUncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or \n\nhyperthyroidism  \n \nImmune system disorders \nRare:  Anaphylactic reactions*  \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: Asymptomatic transaminase increase \nCommon: Severe elevations in transaminases \nUncommon: Hepatitis with or without icterus* \nRare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon: Depression, insomnia  \nRare: Suicide attempt* \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nUncommon: Seizures* \nFrequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, \n\nparaesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may \nmimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations*  \n\n \nEye disorders \nUncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of \n\nretinal artery or vein)* \n \nVascular disorders \nUncommon: Thromboembolic events* \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Dyspnoea* \nFrequency not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see \n\nbelow Pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, maculo-papular rash, alopecia* \nUncommon: Urticaria* \nRare: Quincke\u2019s oedema (angio-oedema)*, erythema multiforme*, erythema \n\nmultiforme-like skin reactions*, Stevens Johnson syndrome* \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective disorders \nCommon: Myalgia, arthralgia \nRare: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus* \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRare: Nephrotic syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) \n \n\n\n\n102 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza-like symptoms \nCommon: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever \nUncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection \n\nsite infections*, increased sweating* \nRare: Injection site cellulitis* \nFrequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nLimited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) \nreceiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults.  \n \nClass effects \n \nThe administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, \nvasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.  \nAn increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, Interferons, ATC code: L03AB07 \n \nInterferons are a group of endogenous glycoproteins endowed with immunomodulatory, antiviral and \nantiproliferative properties. \n \nRebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human \ninterferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore \nglycosylated like the natural protein. \n \nRegardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the \nadministration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2\u20195\u2019OAS synthetase \nand serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to \ndecline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n103 \n\nresponses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological \nresponses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. \n \nBiological response markers (e.g., 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin) are \ninduced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer \nsubjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours \nfor neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin and 2\u20195\u2019OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and \nOAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after \nfirst and sixth administration. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. \n \nSingle clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis \n \nOne 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event \nsuggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least \ntwo clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of \nwhich is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could \nbetter explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded.  \n \nPatients were randomised in a double-blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times \nper week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event \noccurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of \nRebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to \ninitial randomisation.  \n \nEfficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this \nstudy are as follows: \n \n\nParameter \nStatistics \n\nTreatment Treatment Comparison \nRebif 44 mcg tiw versus Placebo \n\nPlacebo  \n(n=171) \n\nRebif 44 \nmcg tiw \n(n=171) \n\nRisk \nReduction \n\nCox\u2019s \nProportional \nHazard Ratio \n\n[95% CI] \n\nLog-Rank \np-value \n\nMcDonald (2005) Conversion \nNumber of events 144 106  \n\n51% \n \n\n0.49 [0.38;0.64] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 85.8% 62.5% \nCDMS Conversion \nNumber of events 60 33  \n\n52% \n \n\n0.48 [0.31;0.73] \n \n\n<0.001 KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% \nMean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period \nLeast Square Means \n(SE) \n\n \n2.59 (0.30) \n\n \n0.50 (0.06) \n\n \n81% \n\n \n0.19 [0.14;0.26]* \n\n \n<0.001 \n\ntiw: three times per week, CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active \n* Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] \n\n \nFor the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more \nconservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least \none new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the \ninitial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple \nsclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously \nthree times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease \n\n\n\n104 \n\nthe incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at \nleast 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of \npatients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed \nthree months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the \nreduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and \n29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated \nwith placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. \n \nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nIn a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence \nof clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the \npreceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was \nreduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and \nthose without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in \npatients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at \nthe end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and \n44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be \ninterpreted cautiously. \n \nPrimary progressive multiple sclerosis \n \nRebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should \nnot be used in these patients.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nIn healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp \nmulti-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular \nadministrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta.  \n \nDistribution \nFollowing repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum \nconcentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) \nincreased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated \napparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple \ndosing. \n \nMetabolism \nInterferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. \n \nRebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. \n \nA study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An \nincreased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No \ninformation is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n\n\n\n105 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n152 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nRebif 22 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \ninterferon beta-1a \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2212 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2212 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\u2212 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2212 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Rebif is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Rebif \n3. How to use Rebif \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rebif \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rebif is and what it is used for \n \nRebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit \nmessages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune \nsystem. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of \nthe central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  \n \nRebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced \nin the human body. \n \nRebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the \nseverity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Rebif \n \nDo not use Rebif \n\u2022 if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 if you are severely depressed at present. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. \n \n\u2022 Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. \n\u2022 Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under \u201cHow to use \n\nRebif\u201d in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue \ndestruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling \nlocal reactions, contact your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) \nto any other medicines. \n\n\n\n153 \n\n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could \naffect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your \ndoctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidney. \n\n \nInform your doctor if you have a disease of  \n\u2022 the bone marrow,  \n\u2022 kidney,  \n\u2022 liver,  \n\u2022 heart,  \n\u2022 thyroid, \n\u2022 or if you have experienced depression,  \n\u2022 or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  \nso that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. \n \nOther medicines and Rebif \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nIn particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEffects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. \nYou should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. \n \nRebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nThis medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nBenzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \n\u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in young children.  \n \nDo not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver \nor kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may \ncause side effects (called \u201cmetabolic acidosis\u201d). \n \n \n3. How to use Rebif \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nDose \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. Your doctor has \nprescribed you a lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week. This lower \ndose is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose. \n \n\n\n\n154 \n\nRebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: \n\u2022 on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) \n\u2022 at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). \n \nUse in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) \nNo formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some \nclinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif \n22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   \n \nUse in children (below 2 years of age) \nRebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \nRebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. \nThe first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare \nprofessional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer can use Rebif \nsyringes to administer the medicine at home. It may also be administered with a suitable auto-injector. \n \nFor administration of Rebif, please read the following instructions carefully: \nThis medicine is for single use. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible \nsigns of deterioration should be used. \n \nHow to inject Rebif \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the \npossible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs \nand the lower abdomen). Hold the syringe like a pencil or \ndart. It is recommended that you keep track of and rotate your \ninjection sites, so that one area is not injected too frequently \nin order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis. \nNOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm \nknots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional \nabout anything you find. \n\n \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\u2022 Remove the Rebif syringe from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. \n\u2022 Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. \n\nIf a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. \n \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Gently pinch the skin together around the site (to lift it up a \nbit). \n\n\u2022 Resting your wrist on the skin near the site, stick the needle at \na right angle straight into the skin with a quick, firm motion. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Inject the medicine by using a slow, steady push (push the \nplunger all the way in until the syringe is empty). \n\n\u2022 Hold a swab on the injection site. Remove the needle from \nthe skin. \n\n \n\n\n\n155 \n\n\u2022 Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. \n\u2022 Dispose of all used items: once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the \n\nsyringe in an appropriate disposal unit. \n \nIf you use more Rebif than you should \nIn case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Rebif \nIf you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Rebif \nThe effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore, you should not stop using Rebif but \ncontinue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please \nconsult your doctor.  \n \nYou should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious \nside effects: \n \n\u2022 Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration \n\nyou experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of \nface, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or \nfaintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are \nrare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n \n\u2022 Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a \n\nliver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, \nloss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver \nproblems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and \nconfusion. \n\n \n\u2022 Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple \n\nsclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your \ndoctor. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea \n\nare very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). \nThese symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease \nwith continued use. \nTo help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller \nbefore a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  \n\n \n\u2022 Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin \n\nbreakdown are very common.  \nThe occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  \n\n\n\n156 \n\nTissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to \n1 in 100 people). \nSee recommendations in section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d to minimise the risk of injection \nsite reactions. \nThe injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and \nhard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact \nyour doctor for advice. \n \n\n\u2022 Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient \n(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular \ntreatment. \nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually \n(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could \ninclude tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  \nLiver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been \nreported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of \nappetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact \nyour doctor immediately (see above \u201cTell your doctor immediately...\u201d). \n\n \n\u2022 Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or \n\ninsufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as \nsymptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. \n\n \n\u2022 MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your \n\ntreatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis \nrelapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from \nmoving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like \nsymptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. \n\n \nOther possible side effects include: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Headache \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) \n\u2022 Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting \n\u2022 Itching, rash (skin eruptions) \n\u2022 Muscle and joints pain \n\u2022 Fatigue, fever, chills \n\u2022 Hair loss \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 Hives \n\u2022 Epileptic seizures \n\u2022 Liver inflammation (hepatitis) \n\u2022 Breathing difficulties \n\u2022 Blood clots such as deep venous thrombosis \n\u2022 Disorders of the retina (back of the eye) such as inflammation or blood clots with consequent \n\nvision disorders (vision disturbances, loss of vision) \n\u2022 Increased sweating \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\u2022 Suicide attempt \n\u2022 Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions \n\n\n\n157 \n\n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic \nthrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased \nbruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness.

What you need to know before you use Rebif \n3. How to use Rebif \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rebif \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rebif is and what it is used for \n \nRebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit \nmessages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune \nsystem. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of \nthe central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  \n \nRebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced \nin the human body. \n \nRebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the \nseverity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients \nwho have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Rebif \n \nDo not use Rebif \n\u2022 if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 if you are severely depressed at present. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. \n \n\u2022 Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. \n\u2022 Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under \u201cHow to use \n\nRebif\u201d in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue \ndestruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling \nlocal reactions, contact your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) \nto any other medicines. \n\n\n\n160 \n\n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could \naffect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your \ndoctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidney. \n\n \nInform your doctor if you have a disease of  \n\u2022 the bone marrow,  \n\u2022 kidney,  \n\u2022 liver,  \n\u2022 heart,  \n\u2022 thyroid, \n\u2022 or if you have experienced depression,  \n\u2022 or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  \nso that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. \n \nOther medicines and Rebif \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nIn particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEffects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. \nYou should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. \n \nRebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nThis medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nBenzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \n\u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in young children.  \n \nDo not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver \nor kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may \ncause side effects (called \u201cmetabolic acidosis\u201d). \n \n \n3. How to use Rebif \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nDose \nPatients who have experienced a single clinical event  \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. \n \nPatients with multiple sclerosis \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week.  \n\n\n\n161 \n\n \nA lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients \nwho cannot tolerate the higher dose. \n \nRebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: \n\u2022 on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) \n\u2022 at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). \n \nUse in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) \nNo formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some \nclinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif \n22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   \n \nUse in children (below 2 years of age) \nRebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \nRebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. \nThe first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare \nprofessional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer can use Rebif \nsyringes to administer the medicine at home. It may also be administered with a suitable auto-injector. \n \nFor administration of Rebif, please read the following instructions carefully: \nThis medicine is for single use. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible \nsigns of deterioration should be used. \n \nHow to inject Rebif \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the \npossible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs \nand the lower abdomen). Hold the syringe like a pencil or \ndart. It is recommended that you keep track of and rotate your \ninjection sites, so that one area is not injected too frequently \nin order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis. \nNOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm \nknots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional \nabout anything you find. \n\n \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\u2022 Remove the Rebif syringe from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. \n\u2022 Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. \n\nIf a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. \n \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Gently pinch the skin together around the site (to lift it up a \nbit). \n\n\u2022 Resting your wrist on the skin near the site, stick the needle at \na right angle straight into the skin with a quick, firm motion. \n\n\n\n162 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Inject the medicine by using a slow, steady push (push the \nplunger all the way in until the syringe is empty). \n\n\u2022 Hold a swab on the injection site. Remove the needle from \nthe skin. \n\n \n\u2022 Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. \n\u2022 Dispose of all used items: once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the \n\nsyringe in an appropriate disposal unit. \n \nIf you use more Rebif than you should \nIn case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Rebif \nIf you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Rebif \nThe effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore, you should not stop using Rebif but \ncontinue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please \nconsult your doctor.  \n \nYou should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious \nside effects: \n \n\u2022 Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration \n\nyou experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of \nface, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or \nfaintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are \nrare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n \n\u2022 Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a \n\nliver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, \nloss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver \nproblems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and \nconfusion. \n\n \n\u2022 Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple \n\nsclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your \ndoctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n163 \n\nTalk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea \n\nare very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). \nThese symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease \nwith continued use. \nTo help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller \nbefore a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  \n\n \n\u2022 Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin \n\nbreakdown are very common.  \nThe occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  \nTissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to \n1 in 100 people). \nSee recommendations in section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d to minimise the risk of injection \nsite reactions. \nThe injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and \nhard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact \nyour doctor for advice. \n \n\n\u2022 Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient \n(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular \ntreatment. \nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually \n(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could \ninclude tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  \nLiver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been \nreported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of \nappetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact \nyour doctor immediately (see above \u201cTell your doctor immediately...\u201d). \n\n \n\u2022 Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or \n\ninsufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as \nsymptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. \n\n \n\u2022 MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your \n\ntreatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis \nrelapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from \nmoving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like \nsymptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. \n\n \nOther possible side effects include: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Headache \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) \n\u2022 Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting \n\u2022 Itching, rash (skin eruptions) \n\u2022 Muscle and joints pain \n\u2022 Fatigue, fever, chills \n\u2022 Hair loss \n \n\n\n\n164 \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 Hives \n\u2022 Epileptic seizures \n\u2022 Liver inflammation (hepatitis) \n\u2022 Breathing difficulties \n\u2022 Blood clots such as deep venous thrombosis \n\u2022 Disorders of the retina (back of the eye) such as inflammation or blood clots with consequent \n\nvision disorders (vision disturbances, loss of vision) \n\u2022 Increased sweating \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\u2022 Suicide attempt \n\u2022 Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions \n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic \n\nthrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased \nbruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your \ndoctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. \n\n\u2022 Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may \ninclude muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs \nsuch as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks \nafter treatment is stopped. \n\n\u2022 Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. \nIf you get some or all of these symptoms:  \n- foamy urine  \n- fatigue  \n- swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. \nTell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem. \n\n \nThe following side effects were reported for interferon beta (frequency not known) \n\u2022 Dizziness  \n\u2022 Nervousness \n\u2022 Loss of appetite \n\u2022 Dilatation of the blood vessels and palpitation  \n\u2022 Irregularities and/or changes in menstrual flow. \n\u2022 Pulmonary arterial hypertension - a disease of severe narrowing of the blood vessels in the lungs \n\nresulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. \nPulmonary arterial hypertension has been seen at various time points during treatment, \nincluding several years after starting treatment with Rebif. \n\n\u2022 Inflammation of the fatty tissue under the skin (panniculitis), which can make the skin feel hard \nand possibly develop painful red lumps or patches. \n\n \nYou should not stop or alter the medication without your doctor\u2019s advice. \n \nChildren and teenagers \nSide effects in children and teenagers are similar to those observed in adults. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

However there is some \nclinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif \n22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   \n \nUse in children (below 2 years of age) \nRebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \nRebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. \nThe first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare \nprofessional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer can use Rebif \nsyringes to administer the medicine at home. It may also be administered with a suitable auto-injector. \n \nFor administration of Rebif, please read the following instructions carefully: \nThis medicine is for single use. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible \nsigns of deterioration should be used. \n \nHow to inject Rebif \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the \npossible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs \nand the lower abdomen). Hold the syringe like a pencil or \ndart. It is recommended that you keep track of and rotate your \ninjection sites, so that one area is not injected too frequently \nin order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis. \nNOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm \nknots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional \nabout anything you find. \n\n \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\u2022 Remove the Rebif syringe from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. \n\u2022 Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. \n\nIf a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. \n \n\n\n\n169 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Gently pinch the skin together around the site (to lift it up a \nbit). \n\n\u2022 Resting your wrist on the skin near the site, stick the needle at \na right angle straight into the skin with a quick, firm motion. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Inject the medicine by using a slow, steady push (push the \nplunger all the way in until the syringe is empty). \n\n\u2022 Hold a swab on the injection site. Remove the needle from \nthe skin. \n\n \n\u2022 Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. \n\u2022 Dispose of all used items: once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the \n\nsyringe in an appropriate disposal unit. \n \nIf you use more Rebif than you should \nIn case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Rebif \nIf you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Rebif \nThe effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore, you should not stop using Rebif but \ncontinue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please \nconsult your doctor.  \n \nYou should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious \nside effects: \n \n\u2022 Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions.

What you need to know before you use Rebif \n3. How to use Rebif \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rebif \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rebif is and what it is used for \n \nRebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit \nmessages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune \nsystem. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of \nthe central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  \n \nRebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced \nin the human body. \n \nRebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the \nseverity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Rebif \n \nDo not use Rebif \n\u2022 if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 if you are severely depressed at present. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. \n \n\u2022 Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. \n\u2022 Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under \u201cHow to use \n\nRebif\u201d in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue \ndestruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling \nlocal reactions, contact your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) \nto any other medicines. \n\n\n\n175 \n\n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could \naffect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your \ndoctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidney. \n\n \nInform your doctor if you have a disease of  \n\u2022 the bone marrow,  \n\u2022 kidney,  \n\u2022 liver,  \n\u2022 heart,  \n\u2022 thyroid, \n\u2022 or if you have experienced depression,  \n\u2022 or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  \nso that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. \n \nOther medicines and Rebif \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nIn particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEffects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. \nYou should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. \n \nRebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nThis medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nBenzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \n\u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in young children.  \n \nDo not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver \nor kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may \ncause side effects (called \u201cmetabolic acidosis\u201d).  \n \n \n3. How to use Rebif \n \nThis medicine is for multidose use. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nDose \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. Your doctor has \nprescribed you a lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week. This lower \ndose is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose \n\n\n\n176 \n\n \nRebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: \n\u2022 on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)  \n\u2022 at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). \n \nUse in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) \nNo formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some \nclinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif \n22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   \n \nUse in children (below 2 years of age) \nRebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n\u2022 Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. \n\u2022 The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified \n\nhealthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer \ncan use Rebif cartridges with your device to administer the medicine at home. \n\n\u2022 The cartridge is to be used with the RebiSmart electronic injection device. \n\u2022 Full instructions for use are provided with your device. Please follow these carefully. \n\u2022 Short instructions on how to use Rebif cartridges are given below. \n \nBefore you start \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\u2022 Remove the Rebif cartridge from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. \n\u2022 Check (just after removing from the refrigerator) that the cartridge is not accidentally frozen in \n\nthe pack or inside the device. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without \nvisible signs of deterioration should be used. \n\n\u2022 To place the cartridge in the device and perform the injection follow the instruction manual \n(Instructions for Use) provided with your device. \n\n \nWhere to inject Rebif \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the \npossible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs \nand the lower abdomen). It is recommended that you keep \ntrack of and rotate your injection sites, so that one area is not \ninjected too frequently in order to minimise the risk of \ninjection site necrosis. \nNOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm \nknots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional \nabout anything you find. \n\n\u2022 Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at \nthe injection site. Let the skin dry. If a bit of alcohol is left on \nthe skin, you may get a stinging sensation. \n\n \nHow to inject Rebif \n\u2022 Your doctor will tell you how to choose the correct dose of 22 micrograms. Please read also the \n\ninstructions in the manual provided with your device (RebiSmart). \n \n\n\n\n177 \n\nRebiSmart \u2022 Please ensure that the dose displayed on the screen of the device \ncorresponds to the prescribed dose of 22 micrograms before the injection. \n\n\u2022 Place RebiSmart at a right angle (90\u00b0) to the skin. \n\u2022 Press the injection button. During the injection, the button will flash with \n\na green light. \n\u2022 Wait until the green light switches off. This tells you that the injection is \n\ncompleted.  \n\u2022 Remove RebiSmart from the injection site. \n\n \n\n \nAfter the injection of Rebif with RebiSmart \n\u2022 Remove and discard the needle according to the instruction manual provided with your device. \n\u2022 Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. \n\u2022 Store your device containing a cartridge of Rebif as instructed in section 5 \u201cHow to store \n\nRebif\u201d. \n \nIf you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nIf you use more Rebif than you should \nIn case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Rebif \nIf you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose.

What Rebif is and what it is used for \n \nRebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit \nmessages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune \nsystem. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of \nthe central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  \n \nRebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced \nin the human body. \n \nRebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the \nseverity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients \nwho have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Rebif \n \nDo not use Rebif \n\u2022 if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 if you are severely depressed at present. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. \n \n\u2022 Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. \n\u2022 Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under \u201cHow to use \n\nRebif\u201d in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue \ndestruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling \nlocal reactions, contact your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) \nto any other medicines. \n\n\n\n183 \n\n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could \naffect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your \ndoctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidney. \n\n \nInform your doctor if you have a disease of  \n\u2022 the bone marrow,  \n\u2022 kidney,  \n\u2022 liver,  \n\u2022 heart,  \n\u2022 thyroid, \n\u2022 or if you have experienced depression,  \n\u2022 or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  \nso that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. \n \nOther medicines and Rebif \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nIn particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEffects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. \nYou should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. \n \nRebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nThis medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nBenzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \n\u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in young children.  \n \nDo not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver \nor kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may \ncause side effects (called \u201cmetabolic acidosis\u201d). \n \n \n3. How to use Rebif \n \nThis medicine is for multidose use. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nDose \nPatients who have experienced a single clinical event  \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. \n \n\n\n\n184 \n\nPatients with multiple sclerosis \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week.  \n \nA lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients \nwho cannot tolerate the higher dose. \n \nRebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: \n\u2022 on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)  \n\u2022 at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). \n \nUse in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) \nNo formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some \nclinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif \n22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   \n \nUse in children (below 2 years of age) \nRebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n\u2022 Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. \n\u2022 The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified \n\nhealthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer \ncan use Rebif cartridges with your device to administer the medicine at home. \n\n\u2022 The cartridge is to be used with the RebiSmart electronic injection device. \n\u2022 Full instructions for use are provided with your device. Please follow these carefully. \n\u2022 Short instructions on how to use Rebif cartridges are given below. \n \nBefore you start \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\u2022 Remove the Rebif cartridge from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. \n\u2022 Check (just after removing from the refrigerator) that the cartridge is not accidentally frozen in \n\nthe pack or inside the device. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without \nvisible signs of deterioration should be used. \n\n\u2022 To place the cartridge in the device and perform the injection follow the instruction manual \n(Instructions for Use) provided with your device. \n\n \nWhere to inject Rebif \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the \npossible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs \nand the lower abdomen). It is recommended that you keep \ntrack of and rotate your injection sites, so that one area is not \ninjected too frequently in order to minimise the risk of \ninjection site necrosis. \nNOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm \nknots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional \nabout anything you find. \n\n\u2022 Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at \nthe injection site. Let the skin dry. If a bit of alcohol is left on \nthe skin, you may get a stinging sensation. \n\n \nHow to inject Rebif \n\u2022 Your doctor will tell you how to choose the correct dose of 44 micrograms. Please read also the \n\ninstructions in the manual provided with your device (RebiSmart). \n \n\n\n\n185 \n\nRebiSmart \u2022 Please ensure that the dose displayed on the screen of the device \ncorresponds to the prescribed dose of 44 micrograms before the injection. \n\n\u2022 Place RebiSmart at a right angle (90\u00b0) to the skin. \n\u2022 Press the injection button. During the injection, the button will flash with \n\na green light. \n\u2022 Wait until the green light switches off. This tells you that the injection is \n\ncompleted.  \n\u2022 Remove RebiSmart from the injection site. \n\n \n\n \nAfter the injection of Rebif with RebiSmart  \n\u2022 Remove and discard the needle according to the instruction manual provided with your device. \n\u2022 Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. \n\u2022 Store your device containing a cartridge of Rebif as instructed in section 5 \u201cHow to store \n\nRebif\u201d. \n \nIf you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nIf you use more Rebif than you should \nIn case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Rebif \nIf you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Rebif \nThe effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore you should not stop using Rebif but \ncontinue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please \nconsult your doctor.  \n \nYou should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious \nside effects: \n \n\u2022 Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration \n\nyou experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of \nface, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or \nfaintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are \nrare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n \n\u2022 Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a \n\nliver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, \nloss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver \nproblems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and \nconfusion. \n\n \n\n\n\n186 \n\n\u2022 Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple \nsclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your \ndoctor. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea \n\nare very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people).  \nThese symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease \nwith continued use.  \nTo help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller \nbefore a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  \n\n \n\u2022 Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin \n\nbreakdown are very common.  \nThe occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  \nTissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to \n1 in 100 people). \nSee recommendations in section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d to minimise the risk of injection \nsite reactions. \nThe injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and \nhard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact \nyour doctor for advice. \n\n \n\u2022 Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient \n\n(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular \ntreatment. \nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually \n(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could \ninclude tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  \nLiver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been \nreported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of \nappetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact \nyour doctor immediately (see above \u201cTell your doctor immediately...\u201d). \n\n \n\u2022 Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or \n\ninsufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as \nsymptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. \n\n \n\u2022 MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your \n\ntreatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis \nrelapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from \nmoving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like \nsymptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. \n\n \nOther possible side effects include: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Headache \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) \n\u2022 Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting \n\u2022 Itching, rash (skin eruptions) \n\u2022 Muscle and joints pain \n\u2022 Fatigue, fever, chills \n\n\n\n187 \n\n\u2022 Hair loss \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 Hives \n\u2022 Epileptic seizures \n\u2022 Liver inflammation (hepatitis) \n\u2022 Breathing difficulties \n\u2022 Blood clots such as deep venous thrombosis \n\u2022 Disorders of the retina (back of the eye) such as inflammation or blood clots with consequent \n\nvision disorders (vision disturbances, loss of vision) \n\u2022 Increased sweating \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\u2022 Suicide attempt \n\u2022 Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions \n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic \n\nthrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome).

Your \ndoctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidney. \n\n \nInform your doctor if you have a disease of  \n\u2022 the bone marrow,  \n\u2022 kidney,  \n\u2022 liver,  \n\u2022 heart,  \n\u2022 thyroid, \n\u2022 or if you have experienced depression,  \n\u2022 or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  \nso that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. \n \nOther medicines and Rebif \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nIn particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEffects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. \nYou should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. \n \nRebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nThis medicine contains 0.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.1 mL and 1.25 mg benzyl alcohol per dose \nof 0.25 mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nBenzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \n\u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in young children.  \n \nDo not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver \nor kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may \ncause side effects (called \u201cmetabolic acidosis\u201d). \n \n \n3. How to use Rebif \n \nThis medicine is for multidose use. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \n\n\n\n192 \n\nInitiating treatment \nTreatment is initiated by a gradual increase of the dose (a so-called \u2018dose titration\u2019) over a period of 4 \nweeks in order to reduce some of the side effects, it is recommended that: \n\u2022 During weeks one and two, Rebif 8.8 micrograms should be injected three times per week. \n\u2022 During weeks three and four, Rebif 22 micrograms should be injected three times per week. \n \nFrom the fifth week onwards, after you have completed your initiation period, you will follow the \nusual dose regimen prescribed by your doctor. \n \nDose \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. \n \nA lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients \nwith multiple sclerosis who cannot tolerate the higher dose. \n \nRebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: \n\u2022 on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)  \n\u2022 at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). \n \nUse in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) \nNo formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some \nclinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif \n22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   \n \nUse in children (below 2 years of age) \nRebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n\u2022 Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. \n\u2022 The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified \n\nhealthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer \ncan use Rebif cartridges with your device to administer the medicine at home. \n\n\u2022 The initiation pack contains two identical cartridges of Rebif and you may initiate treatment \nwith either cartridge.  \n\n\u2022 The cartridge is to be used with the RebiSmart electronic injection device. \n\u2022 Full instructions for use are provided with your device. Please follow these carefully. \n\u2022 Short instructions on how to use Rebif cartridges  are given below. \n \nBefore you start \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\u2022 Remove the Rebif cartridge from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. \n\u2022 Check (just after removing from the refrigerator) that the cartridge is not accidentally frozen in \n\nthe pack or inside the device. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without \nvisible signs of deterioration should be used. \n\n\u2022 To place the cartridge in the device and perform the injection follow the instruction manual \n(Instructions for Use) provided with your device. \n\n \n\n\n\n193 \n\nWhere to inject Rebif \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the \npossible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs \nand the lower abdomen). It is recommended that you keep \ntrack of and rotate your injection sites, so that one area is not \ninjected too frequently in order to minimise the risk of \ninjection site necrosis. \nNOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm \nknots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional \nabout anything you find. \n\n\u2022 Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at \nthe injection site. Let the skin dry. If a bit of alcohol is left on \nthe skin, you may get a stinging sensation. \n\n \nHow to inject Rebif \n\u2022 Your doctor will tell you how to choose the correct dose. Please read also the instructions in the \n\nmanual provided with your device (RebiSmart). \n \n\nRebiSmart \u2022 RebiSmart is programmed to guide you through the entire initiation \nprocess and automatically increases the dose during the initiation period. \nIt will also instruct you when you need to change the cartridge.  \n\n\u2022 You will need to select the dose prescribed by your doctor via the \nRebiSmart menu to ensure the correct recording of your dose. \n\n\u2022 To activate the \u201cinitiation/titration\u201d menu you need to first select \n44 micrograms, then \u2018initiation/titration\u2019, press \u2018change\u2019, select \u2018on\u2019, \npress \u2018ok\u2019 and confirm \u2018initiation/titration on\u2019 by pressing \u2018ok\u2019. \n\n \n\u2022 The device will ensure that:  \n\n\u2212 During weeks one and two, Rebif 8.8 micrograms are injected three times per week. \n\u2212 During weeks three and four, Rebif 22 micrograms are injected three times per week. \n\u2212 From the fifth week onwards, RebiSmart will automatically switch to the usual dose \n\nregimen. \n\u2022 Place RebiSmart at a right angle (90\u00b0) to the skin.  \n\u2022 Press the injection button. During the injection, the button will flash with a green light. \n\u2022 Wait until the green light switches off. This tells you that the injection is completed. \n\u2022 Remove RebiSmart from the injection site. \n\n \nAfter the injection of Rebif with RebiSmart \n\u2022 Remove and discard the needle according to the instruction manual provided with your device. \n\u2022 Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. \n\u2022 Store your device containing a cartridge of Rebif as instructed in section 5 \u201cHow to store \n\nRebif\u201d. \n \nIf you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nIf you use more Rebif than you should \nIn case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Rebif \nIf you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\n\n\n194 \n\nIf you stop using Rebif \nThe effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore you should not stop using Rebif but \ncontinue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please \nconsult your doctor.  \n \nYou should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious \nside effects: \n \n\u2022 Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration \n\nyou experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of \nface, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or \nfaintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are \nrare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n \n\u2022 Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a \n\nliver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, \nloss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver \nproblems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and \nconfusion. \n\n \n\u2022 Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple \n\nsclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your \ndoctor. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea \n\nare very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people).  \nThese symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease \nwith continued use.  \nTo help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller \nbefore a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  \n\n \n\u2022 Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin \n\nbreakdown are very common.  \nThe occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  \nTissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to \n1 in 100 people). \nSee recommendations in section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d to minimise the risk of injection \nsite reactions. \nThe injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and \nhard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact \nyour doctor for advice. \n\n \n\u2022 Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient \n\n(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular \ntreatment. \n\n\n\n195 \n\nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually \n(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could \ninclude tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  \nLiver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been \nreported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of \nappetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact \nyour doctor immediately (see above \u201cTell your doctor immediately...\u201d). \n\n \n\u2022 Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or \n\ninsufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as \nsymptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. \n\n \n\u2022 MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your \n\ntreatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis \nrelapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from \nmoving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like \nsymptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. \n\n \nOther possible side effects include: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Headache \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) \n\u2022 Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting \n\u2022 Itching, rash (skin eruptions) \n\u2022 Muscle and joints pain \n\u2022 Fatigue, fever, chills \n\u2022 Hair loss \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 Hives \n\u2022 Epileptic seizures \n\u2022 Liver inflammation (hepatitis) \n\u2022 Breathing difficulties \n\u2022 Blood clots such as deep venous thrombosis \n\u2022 Disorders of the retina (back of the eye) such as inflammation or blood clots with consequent \n\nvision disorders (vision disturbances, loss of vision) \n\u2022 Increased sweating \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\u2022 Suicide attempt \n\u2022 Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions \n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic \n\nthrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased \nbruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your \ndoctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. \n\n\u2022 Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may \ninclude muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs \nsuch as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks \nafter treatment is stopped. \n\n\n\n196 \n\n\u2022 Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. \nIf you get some or all of these symptoms:  \n- foamy urine  \n- fatigue  \n- swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. \nTell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem. \n\n \nThe following side effects were reported for interferon beta (frequency not known) \n\u2022 Dizziness  \n\u2022 Nervousness \n\u2022 Loss of appetite \n\u2022 Dilatation of the blood vessels and palpitation  \n\u2022 Irregularities and/or changes in menstrual flow \n\u2022 Pulmonary arterial hypertension - a disease of severe narrowing of the blood vessels in the lungs \n\nresulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. \nPulmonary arterial hypertension has been seen at various time points during treatment, \nincluding several years after starting treatment with Rebif. \n\n\u2022 Inflammation of the fatty tissue under the skin (panniculitis), which can make the skin feel hard \nand possibly develop painful red lumps or patches. \n\n \nYou should not stop or alter the medication without your doctor\u2019s advice. \n \nChildren and teenagers \nSide effects in children and teenagers are similar to those observed in adults. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What Rebif is and what it is used for \n \nRebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit \nmessages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune \nsystem. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of \nthe central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  \n \nRebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced \nin the human body. \n \nRebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the \nseverity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Rebif \n \nDo not use Rebif \n\u2022 if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 if you are severely depressed at present. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. \n \n\u2022 Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. \n\u2022 Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the \u201cRebiDose Instructions for Use\u201d \n\nprovided in a separate booklet, in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin \nbreakdown and tissue destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you \nexperience troubling local reactions, contact your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) \nto any other medicines. \n\n\n\n199 \n\n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could \naffect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your \ndoctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidney. \n\n \nInform your doctor if you have a disease of  \n\u2022 the bone marrow,  \n\u2022 kidney,  \n\u2022 liver,  \n\u2022 heart,  \n\u2022 thyroid, \n\u2022 or if you have experienced depression,  \n\u2022 or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  \nso that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. \n \nOther medicines and Rebif \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nIn particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEffects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. \nYou should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. \n \nRebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nThis medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nBenzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \n\u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in young children.  \n \nDo not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver \nor kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may \ncause side effects (called \u201cmetabolic acidosis\u201d). \n \n \n3.

These reactions are \nrare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n \n\n\n\n201 \n\n\u2022 Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a \nliver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, \nloss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver \nproblems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and \nconfusion. \n\n \n\u2022 Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple \n\nsclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your \ndoctor. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea \n\nare very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). \nThese symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease \nwith continued use. \nTo help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller \nbefore a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  \n\n \n\u2022 Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin \n\nbreakdown are very common.  \nThe occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  \nTissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up \nto 1 in 100 people). \nSee recommendations in section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d to minimise the risk of injection \nsite reactions. \nThe injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and \nhard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, \ncontact your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\u2022 Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient \n\n(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular \ntreatment. \nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually \n(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could \ninclude tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  \nLiver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been \nreported (uncommon).

After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer \ncan use RebiDose to administer the medicine at home. If you have questions about how to inject, \nplease ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for assistance. \n\n\u2022 Read all the following instructions carefully before using RebiDose. \n \nEquipment \n \nTo give yourself an injection you will need: \n\u2022 A new RebiDose and \n\u2022 Alcohol wipes or similar. \n\u2022 a dry cotton ball or gauze \n \nBelow is a picture showing what RebiDose looks like. \n \nBefore the injection \n\n \n \n\nAfter the injection \n\n \n \nA. Cap \nB. Transparent window \nC. Plunger \nD. Label \nE. Main body \nF. Button \nG. Safety guard \nH. Needle \n\n \n \nBefore you start \n \n\u2022 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\u2022 Remove RebiDose from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. \n\u2022 Check the appearance of Rebif through the transparent window. It must be clear to opalescent, \n\nwithout particles and without any visible signs of deterioration. If there are particles or other \n\n\n\n206 \n\nvisible signs of deteriorations, do not use it and contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for \nassistance. \n\n\u2022 Check the expiry date on the RebiDose label or on the outer box (as indicated as \u201cEXP\u201d). Do \nnot use RebiDose if the expiry date has passed. \n\n \nWhere to inject with RebiDose \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on \nthe possible injection sites (good sites include the upper \nthighs and the lower abdomen.)  \n\n\u2022 Keep track of and rotate your injection sites, so that one \narea is not injected too often. This is to minimise the risk \nof skin damage (necrosis). \n\n\u2022 NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, \nfirm knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare \nprofessional about anything you find. \n\n \nHow to inject with RebiDose \n \n\u2022 Do not remove the cap until you are ready to administer the injection. \n\u2022 Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. \n\nIf a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. \n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Hold RebiDose by the main body and use your other hand \nto remove the cap. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Hold RebiDose at a right angle (90 degrees) to the injection \nsite. Push the pen against your skin until you feel resistance. \nThis action unlocks the button. \n\n\n\n207 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Keep enough pressure on the skin and press the button with \nyour thumb. You will hear a click which indicates the start \nof the injection and the plunger will start moving. Keep \nRebiDose pressed against the skin for at least 10 seconds in \norder to inject all of the medicine. \nIt is not necessary to keep the button pressed down with \nyour thumb after the injection has begun. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Remove RebiDose from the injection site. \nThe safety guard automatically surrounds the needle and \nlocks into place to protect you from the needle. \n\n \nAfter the injection \n \n\n  \n\n\u2022 Look through the transparent window to make sure that the \nplunger has moved to the bottom as indicated in the figure. \n\n\u2022 Visually check that there is no liquid left. If there is liquid \nleft, not all of the medicine has been injected and you \nshould consult your doctor or nurse for assistance. \n\n \n\u2022 Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. \n\u2022 Do not put the needle cap back on the used RebiDose. This is because the needle is now \n\ncovered by the safety guard. Do not put your fingers in the safety guard. \n\u2022 RebiDose is for single use only and should never be reused. \n\u2022 Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard RebiDose. Ask your pharmacist \n\nhow to safely dispose of RebiDose. \n \nIf you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \nThis \u201cInstructions for use\u201d was last revised in \n\n\n\n208 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nRebif 44 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen \ninterferon beta-1a \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2212 Keep this leaflet.

What you need to know before you use Rebif \n3. How to use Rebif \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rebif \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rebif is and what it is used for \n \nRebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit \nmessages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune \nsystem. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of \nthe central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  \n \nRebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced \nin the human body. \n \nRebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the \nseverity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients \nwho have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Rebif \n \nDo not use Rebif \n\u2022 if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 if you are severely depressed at present. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. \n \n\u2022 Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. \n\u2022 Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the \u201cRebiDose Instructions for Use\u201d \n\nprovided in a separate booklet, in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin \nbreakdown and tissue destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you \nexperience troubling local reactions, contact your doctor. \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) \nto any other medicines. \n\n\n\n209 \n\n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could \naffect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your \ndoctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidney. \n\n \nInform your doctor if you have a disease of  \n\u2022 the bone marrow,  \n\u2022 kidney,  \n\u2022 liver,  \n\u2022 heart,  \n\u2022 thyroid, \n\u2022 or if you have experienced depression,  \n\u2022 or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  \nso that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. \n \nOther medicines and Rebif \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nIn particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEffects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. \nYou should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. \n \nRebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nThis medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nBenzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \n\u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in young children.  \n \nDo not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver \nor kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may \ncause side effects (called \u201cmetabolic acidosis\u201d). \n \n \n3. How to use Rebif \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nDose \nPatients who have experienced a single clinical event  \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. \n \nPatients with multiple sclerosis \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week.  \n\n\n\n210 \n\n \nA lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients \nwho cannot tolerate the higher dose \n \nRebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: \n\u2022 on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) \n\u2022 at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). \n \nUse in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) \nNo formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some \nclinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif \n22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   \n \nUse in children (below 2 years of age) \nRebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n\u2022 Rebif is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously) using a pre-filled pen called \n\n\u201cRebiDose\u201d. \n\u2022 Use each RebiDose only once. \n\u2022 The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified \n\nhealthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer \ncan use Rebif pre-filled pen to administer the medicine at home. \n\n\u2022 When you do this please read carefully and follow the \u201cRebiDose Instructions for Use\u201d \nprovided separately in the booklet. \n\n \nOnly clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible signs of deterioration should be \nused. \n \nIf you use more Rebif than you should \nIn case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Rebif \nIf you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Rebif \nThe effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore, you should not stop using Rebif but \ncontinue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please \nconsult your doctor.  \n \nYou should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious \nside effects: \n \n\u2022 Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration \n\nyou experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of \nface, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or \n\n\n\n211 \n\nfaintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are \nrare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n \n\u2022 Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a \n\nliver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, \nloss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver \nproblems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and \nconfusion. \n\n \n\u2022 Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple \n\nsclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your \ndoctor. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea \n\nare very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). \nThese symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease \nwith continued use. \nTo help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller \nbefore a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  \n\n \n\u2022 Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin \n\nbreakdown are very common.  \nThe occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  \nTissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up \nto 1 in 100 people). \nSee recommendations in section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d to minimise the risk of injection \nsite reactions. \nThe injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and \nhard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, \ncontact your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\u2022 Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient \n\n(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular \ntreatment. \nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually \n(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could \ninclude tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  \nLiver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been \nreported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of \nappetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact \nyour doctor immediately (see above \u201cTell your doctor immediately...\u201d). \n\n \n\u2022 Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or \n\ninsufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as \nsymptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. \n\n \n\u2022 MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your \n\ntreatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis \nrelapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from \nmoving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like \nsymptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n212 \n\nOther possible side effects include: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Headache \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) \n\u2022 Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting \n\u2022 Itching, rash (skin eruptions) \n\u2022 Muscle and joints pain \n\u2022 Fatigue, fever, chills \n\u2022 Hair loss \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 Hives \n\u2022 Epileptic seizures \n\u2022 Liver inflammation (hepatitis) \n\u2022 Breathing difficulties \n\u2022 Blood clots such as deep venous thrombosis \n\u2022 Disorders of the retina (back of the eye) such as inflammation or blood clots with consequent \n\nvision disorders (vision disturbances, loss of vision) \n\u2022 Increased sweating \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\u2022 Suicide attempt \n\u2022 Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions \n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic \n\nthrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome).

What you need to know before you use Rebif \n3. How to use Rebif \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rebif \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rebif is and what it is used for \n \nRebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit \nmessages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune \nsystem. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of \nthe central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis.  \n \nRebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced \nin the human body. \n \nRebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the \nseverity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients \nwho have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Rebif \n \nDo not use Rebif \n\u2022 if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 if you are severely depressed at present. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. \n \n\u2022 Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. \n\u2022 Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the \u201cRebiDose Instructions for Use\u201d \n\nprovided in a separate booklet, in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin \nbreakdown and tissue destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you \nexperience troubling local reactions, contact your doctor. \n\n\n\n219 \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) \nto any other medicines. \n\n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could \naffect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your \ndoctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidney. \n\n \nInform your doctor if you have a disease of  \n\u2022 the bone marrow,  \n\u2022 kidney,  \n\u2022 liver,  \n\u2022 heart,  \n\u2022 thyroid, \n\u2022 or if you have experienced depression,  \n\u2022 or if you have any history of epileptic seizures,  \nso that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. \n \nOther medicines and Rebif \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nIn particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast-\nfeeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEffects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. \nYou should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. \n \nRebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nThis medicine contains 1.0 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.2 mL and 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose \nof 0.5 mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \nBenzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \n\u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in young children.  \n \nDo not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver \nor kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may \ncause side effects (called \u201cmetabolic acidosis\u201d).  \n \n \n3. How to use Rebif \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \n\n\n\n220 \n\nInitiating treatment \nTreatment is initiated by a gradual increase of the dose (a so-called \u201cdose titration) over a period of 4 \nweeks, in order to reduce some of the side effects, it is recommended that: \n\u2022 During weeks one and two, Rebif 8.8 micrograms should be injected three times per week. \n\u2022 During weeks three and four, Rebif 22 micrograms should be injected three times per week. \n \nFrom the fifth week onwards, after you have completed your initiation period, you will follow the \nusual dose regimen.  \n \nDose \nThe usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week.  \n \nA lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients \nwith multiple sclerosis who cannot tolerate the higher dose. \n \nRebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: \n\u2022 on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) \n\u2022 at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). \n \nUse in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) \nNo formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some \nclinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif \n22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults.   \n \nUse in children (below 2 years of age) \nRebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n\u2022 Rebif is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously) using a pre-filled pen called \n\n\u201cRebiDose\u201d. \n\u2022 Use each RebiDose only once. \n\u2022 The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified \n\nhealthcare professional. After receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer \ncan use Rebif pre-filled pen to administer the medicine at home. \n\n\u2022 When you do this please read carefully and follow the \u201cRebiDose Instructions for Use\u201d \nprovided separately in the booklet. \n\n \nOnly clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible signs of deterioration should be \nused. \n \nIf you use more Rebif than you should \nIn case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Rebif \nIf you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. Do not use a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Rebif \nThe effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore, you should not stop using Rebif but \ncontinue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please \nconsult your doctor.  \n \nYou should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n\n\n\n221 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious \nside effects: \n \n\u2022 Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. If, immediately following Rebif administration \n\nyou experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of \nface, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or \nfaintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are \nrare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n \n\u2022 Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a \n\nliver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, \nloss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver \nproblems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and \nconfusion. \n\n \n\u2022 Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple \n\nsclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your \ndoctor. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea \n\nare very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). \nThese symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease \nwith continued use. \nTo help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller \nbefore a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection.  \n\n \n\u2022 Injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin \n\nbreakdown are very common.  \nThe occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time.  \nTissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up \nto 1 in 100 people). \nSee recommendations in section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d to minimise the risk of injection \nsite reactions. \nThe injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and \nhard and the whole area could be very painful. If you experience any of these symptoms, \ncontact your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\u2022 Certain laboratory tests may change. These changes are generally not noticed by the patient \n\n(no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular \ntreatment. \nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually \n(very common) or all at one time (rare). Possible symptoms resulting from these changes could \ninclude tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding.  \nLiver function tests may be disturbed (very common). Inflammation of the liver has also been \nreported (uncommon). If you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of \nappetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact \nyour doctor immediately (see above \u201cTell your doctor immediately...\u201d). \n\n \n\u2022 Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The thyroid gland may function either excessively, or \n\ninsufficiently. These changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as \nsymptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. \n\n\n\n222 \n\n \n\u2022 MS pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): There is a possibility that at the beginning of your \n\ntreatment with Rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis \nrelapse. For example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from \nmoving as you want. In some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like \nsymptoms described above. If you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. \n\n \nOther possible side effects include: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Headache \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) \n\u2022 Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting \n\u2022 Itching, rash (skin eruptions) \n\u2022 Muscle and joints pain \n\u2022 Fatigue, fever, chills \n\u2022 Hair loss \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 Hives \n\u2022 Epileptic seizures \n\u2022 Liver inflammation (hepatitis) \n\u2022 Breathing difficulties \n\u2022 Blood clots such as deep venous thrombosis \n\u2022 Disorders of the retina (back of the eye) such as inflammation or blood clots with consequent \n\nvision disorders (vision disturbances, loss of vision) \n\u2022 Increased sweating \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n\u2022 Suicide attempt \n\u2022 Serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions \n\u2022 Blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic \n\nthrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). Symptoms may include increased \nbruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. Your \ndoctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. \n\n\u2022 Drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of Rebif. Symptoms may \ninclude muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. You may also experience other signs \nsuch as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks \nafter treatment is stopped. \n\n\u2022 Kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. \nIf you get some or all of these symptoms:  \n- foamy urine  \n- fatigue  \n- swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. \nTell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem. \n\n \nThe following side effects were reported for interferon beta (frequency not known) \n\u2022 Dizziness  \n\u2022 Nervousness \n\u2022 Loss of appetite \n\u2022 Dilatation of the blood vessels and palpitation  \n\u2022 Irregularities and/or changes in menstrual flow. \n\n\n\n223 \n\n\u2022 Pulmonary arterial hypertension - a disease of severe narrowing of the blood vessels in the lungs \nresulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. \nPulmonary arterial hypertension has been seen at various time points during treatment, \nincluding several years after starting treatment with Rebif. \n\n\u2022 Inflammation of the fatty tissue under the skin (panniculitis), which can make the skin feel hard \nand possibly develop painful red lumps or patches. \n\n \nYou should not stop or alter the medication without your doctor\u2019s advice. \n \nChildren and teenagers \nSide effects in children and teenagers are similar to those observed in adults. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using rebif. rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. before treatment with rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under \"how to use rebif\" in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with rebif. if you experience troubling local reactions, contact your doctor. talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) to any other medicines. blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. these blood clots could affect your kidneys. this might happen several weeks to several years after starting rebif. your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your kidney. inform your doctor if you have a disease of the bone marrow, kidney, liver, heart, thyroid, or if you have experienced depression, or if you have any history of epileptic seizures, so that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. other medicines and rebif tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. in particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. pregnancy and

machines. you should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. rebif contains sodium and benzyl alcohol this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 'sodium-free'. this medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \"gasping syndrome\") in young children. do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your doctor or pharmacist. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have a liver or kidney disease. this is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build-up in your body and may cause side effects (called \"metabolic acidosis\").", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "rebif", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 11, "BeginOffset": 11, "EndOffset":

to use rebif", "Section_Content": "always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor if you are not sure. dose the usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million iu) given three times per week. your doctor has prescribed you a lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million iu) given three times per week. this lower dose is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose. rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g. monday, wednesday, friday) at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) no formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. however there is some clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving rebif 22 micrograms or rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. use in children (below 2 years of age) rebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. method of administration rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. the first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare professional. after receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer can use rebif syringes to administer the medicine at home. it may also be administered with a suitable auto-injector. for administration of rebif, please read the following instructions carefully: this medicine is for single use. only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible signs of deterioration should be used. how to inject rebif choose an injection site. your doctor will advise you on the possible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs and the lower abdomen). hold the syringe like a pencil or dart. it is recommended that you keep track of and rotate your injection sites, so that one area is not injected too frequently in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis. note: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional about anything you find. wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. remove the rebif syringe from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. let the skin dry. if a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. gently pinch the skin together around the site (to lift it up a bit). resting your wrist on the skin near the site, stick the needle at a right angle straight into the skin with a quick, firm motion. inject the medicine by using a slow, steady push (push the plunger all the way in until the syringe is empty). hold a swab on the injection site. remove the needle from the skin. gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. dispose of all used items: once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the syringe in an appropriate disposal unit. if you use more rebif than you should in case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. if you forget to use rebif if you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next scheduled dose. do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop using rebif the effects of rebif may not be noticed immediately. therefore, you should not stop using rebif but continue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. if you are uncertain about the benefits, please consult your doctor. you should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "rebif", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 11,

"4. possible side effects", "Section_Content": "like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. tell your doctor immediately and stop using rebif if you experience any of the following serious side effects: serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. if, immediately following rebif administration you experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of face, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or faintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. these reactions are rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a liver problem: jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. severe liver problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty concentrating, sleepiness and confusion. depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple sclerosis. if you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide, report it immediately to your doctor. talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following side effects: flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). these symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease with continued use. to help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller before a dose of rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection. injection site reactions including redness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin breakdown are very common. the occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time. tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). see recommendations in section \"warnings and precautions\" to minimise the risk of injection site reactions. the injection site can become infected (uncommon); the skin may become swollen tender and hard and the whole area could be very painful. if you experience any of these symptoms, contact your doctor for advice. certain laboratory tests may change. these changes are generally not noticed by the patient (no symptoms), are usually reversible and mild, and most often do not require particular treatment. the number of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets may decrease either individually (very common) or all at one time (rare). possible symptoms resulting from these changes could include tiredness, reduced ability to fight infection, bruising or unexplained bleeding. liver function tests may be disturbed (very common). inflammation of the liver has also been reported (uncommon). if you experience symptoms suggesting a liver disorder, such as loss of appetite accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, please contact your doctor immediately (see above \"tell your doctor immediately...\"). thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. the thyroid gland may function either excessively, or insufficiently. these changes in the thyroid activity are almost always not felt by the patient as symptoms; however your doctor may recommend testing as appropriate. ms pseudo-relapse (frequency not known): there is a possibility that at the beginning of your treatment with rebif you may experience symptoms that resemble those of a multiple sclerosis relapse. for example, your muscles may feel very tense or very weak, preventing you from moving as you want. in some cases such symptoms are associated with fever or flu-like symptoms described above. if you notice any of these side effects talk to your doctor. other possible side effects include: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): headache common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): insomnia (sleeping difficulty) diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting itching, rash (skin eruptions) muscle and joints pain fatigue, fever, chills hair loss uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): hives epileptic seizures liver inflammation (hepatitis) breathing difficulties blood clots such as deep venous thrombosis disorders of the retina (back of the eye) such as inflammation or blood clots with consequent vision disorders (vision disturbances, loss of vision) increased sweating rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): suicide attempt serious skin reactions - some with mucosal lesions 157 blood clots in the small blood vessels that can affect your kidneys (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or haemolytic uremic syndrome). symptoms may include increased bruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness. your doctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. drug-induced lupus erythematosus: a side-effect of long-term use of rebif. symptoms may include muscle pain, joint pain and swelling, and rash. you may also experience other signs such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. usually symptoms disappear within one or two weeks after treatment is stopped. kidney problems including scarring that may reduce your kidney function. if you get some or all of these symptoms: - foamy urine - fatigue - swelling, particularly in the ankles and eyelids, and weight gain. tell your doctor as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem. the following side effects were reported for interferon beta (frequency not known) dizziness nervousness loss of appetite dilatation of the blood vessels and palpitation irregularities and/or changes in menstrual flow. pulmonary arterial hypertension - a disease of severe narrowing of the blood vessels in the lungs resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. pulmonary arterial hypertension has been seen at various time points during treatment, including several years after starting treatment with rebif. inflammation of the fatty tissue under the skin (panniculitis), which can make the skin feel hard and possibly develop painful red lumps or patches. you should not stop or alter the medication without your doctor's advice. children and teenagers side effects in children and teenagers are similar to those observed in adults. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "rebif", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "all
