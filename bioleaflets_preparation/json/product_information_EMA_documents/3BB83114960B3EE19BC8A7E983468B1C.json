NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCombivir 150 mg/300 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg lamivudine and 300 mg zidovudine.\n\nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet\n\nWhite to off-white, capsule-shaped film-coated scored tablets engraved with “GXFC3” on both sides. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\nCombivir is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human \nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (see section 4.2).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nCombivir may be administered with or without food.\n\nTo ensure administration of the entire dose, the tablet(s) should ideally be swallowed without \ncrushing.  For patients who are unable to swallow tablets, tablets may be crushed and added to a small \namount of semi-solid food or liquid, all of which should be consumed immediately (see section 5.2).\n\nAdults and adolescents weighing at least 30 kg: the recommended dose of Combivir is one tablet twice \ndaily. \n\nChildren weighing between 21 kg and 30 kg: the recommended oral dose of Combivir is one-half \ntablet taken in the morning and one whole tablet taken in the evening.\n\nChildren weighing from 14 kg to 21 kg: the recommended oral dose of Combivir is one-half tablet \ntaken twice daily.\n\nThe dosing regimen for paediatric patients weighing 14-30 kg is based primarily on pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and supported by data from clinical studies using the individual components lamivudine \nand zidovudine.  A pharmacokinetic overexposure of zidovudine can occur, therefore close safety \nmonitoring is warranted in these patients. If gastrointestinal intolerance occurs in patients weighing \n21-30 kg, an alternative dosing schedule with one-half tablet taken thrice daily can be applied in \nattempt to improve tolerability.\n\nCombivir tablets should not be used for children weighing less than 14 kg, since doses cannot be \nappropriately adjusted for the weight of the child.  In these patients, lamivudine and zidovudine should \nbe taken as separate formulations according to the prescribed dosing recommendations for these \nproducts.  For these patients and for patients, who are unable to swallow tablets, oral solutions of \nlamivudine and zidovudine are available.\n\n\n\n3\n\nFor situations where discontinuation of therapy with one of the active substances of Combivir, or dose \nreduction is necessary separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine are available in \ntablets/capsules and oral solution.\n\nRenal impairment: Lamivudine and zidovudine concentrations are increased in patients with renal \nimpairment due to decreased clearance.  Therefore as dosage adjustment of these may be necessary it \nis recommended that separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine be administered to patients \nwith reduced renal function (creatinine clearance 50 ml/min).  Physicians should refer to the \nindividual prescribing information for these medicinal products.\n\nHepatic impairment: Limited data in patients with cirrhosis suggest that accumulation of zidovudine \nmay occur in patients with hepatic impairment because of decreased glucuronidation.  Data obtained in \npatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment show that lamivudine pharmacokinetics are not \nsignificantly affected by hepatic dysfunction.  However, as dosage adjustments for zidovudine may be \nnecessary, it is recommended that separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine be administered \nto patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Physicians should refer to the individual prescribing \ninformation for these medicinal products.\n\nDosage adjustments in patients with haematological adverse reactions: Dosage adjustment of \nzidovudine may be necessary if the haemoglobin level falls below 9 g/dl or 5.59 mmol/l or the \nneutrophil count falls below 1.0 x 109/l (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  As dosage adjustment of Combivir \nis not possible, separate preparations of zidovudine and lamivudine should be used.  Physicians should \nrefer to the individual prescribing information for these medicinal products.\n\nDosage in the elderly: No specific data are available, however special care is advised in this age group \ndue to age associated changes such as the decrease in renal function and alteration of haematological \nparameters.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nZidovudine is contraindicated in patients with abnormally low neutrophil counts (<0.75 x 109/l), or \nabnormally low haemoglobin levels (<7.5 g/dl or 4.65 mmol/l).  Combivir is therefore contraindicated \nin these patients (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nThe special warnings and precautions relevant to both lamivudine and zidovudine are included in this \nsection. There are no additional precautions and warnings relevant to the combination Combivir.\n\nIt is recommended that separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine should be administered in \ncases where dosage adjustment is necessary (see section 4.2).  In these cases the physician should \nrefer to the individual prescribing information for these medicinal products.\n\nThe concomitant use of stavudine with zidovudine should be avoided (see section 4.5).\n\nOpportunistic infections: Patients receiving Combivir or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue \nto develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection.  Therefore patients \nshould remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of HIV \ninfection.\n\n\n\n4\n\nHaematological adverse reactions: Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to \nneutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine.  These occurred more \nfrequently at higher zidovudine dosages (1200-1500 mg/day) and in patients with poor bone marrow \nreserve prior to treatment, particularly with advanced HIV disease.  Haematological parameters should \ntherefore be carefully monitored (see section 4.3) in patients receiving Combivir.  These \nhaematological effects are not usually observed before four to six weeks therapy.  For patients with \nadvanced symptomatic HIV disease, it is generally recommended that blood tests are performed at \nleast every two weeks for the first three months of therapy and at least monthly thereafter.\n\nIn patients with early HIV disease haematological adverse reactions are infrequent.  Depending on the \noverall condition of the patient, blood tests may be performed less often, for example every one to \nthree months.  Additionally dosage adjustment of zidovudine may be required if severe anaemia or \nmyelosuppression occurs during treatment with Combivir, or in patients with pre-existing bone \nmarrow compromise e.g. haemoglobin <9 g/dl (5.59 mmol/l) or neutrophil count <1.0 x 109/l (see \nsection 4.2).  As dosage adjustment of Combivir is not possible separate preparations of zidovudine \nand lamivudine should be used.  Physicians should refer to the individual prescribing information for \nthese medicinal products.\n\nPancreatitis: Cases of pancreatitis have occurred rarely in patients treated with lamivudine and \nzidovudine. However it is not clear whether these cases were due to the antiretroviral treatment or to \nthe underlying HIV disease. Treatment with Combivir should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, \nsymptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur.\n\nLactic acidosis: Lactic acidosis usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis has been \nreported with the use of zidovudine.  Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactatemia) include benign \ndigestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain) non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, \nweight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including \nmotor weakness).\n\nLactic acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure, or renal \nfailure.\n\nLactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment.\n\nTreatment with zidovudine should be discontinued if there is symptomatic hyperlactatemia and \nmetabolic/lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels.\n\nCaution should be exercised when administering zidovudine to any patient (particularly obese women) \nwith hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis \n(including certain medicinal products and alcohol).  Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated \nwith alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk.\n\nPatients at increased risk should be followed closely.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero: Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues may \nimpact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with stavudine, \ndidanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative \ninfants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues; these have predominantly \nconcerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse reactions reported are \nhaematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, \nhyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late-onset neurological disorders have \nbeen reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such neurological \ndisorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be considered for\nany child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, who presents with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV.\n\n\n\n5\n\nLipoatrophy: Treatment with zidovudine has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat, which has \nbeen linked to mitochondrial toxicity. The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are related to \ncumulative exposure. This fat loss, which is most evident in the face, limbs and buttocks, may not be \nreversible when switching to a zidovudine-free regimen. Patients should be regularly assessed for \nsigns of lipoatrophy during therapy with zidovudine and zidovudine-containing products (Combivir \nand Trizivir). Therapy should be switched to an alternative regimen if there is suspicion of lipoatrophy \ndevelopment.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters: An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose \nmay occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life \nstyle. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is \nno strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose \nreference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as \nclinically appropriate.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to \nasymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or \naggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or \nmonths of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or \nfocal mycobacterium infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (often referred to as PCP).  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and\nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nLiver disease: If lamivudine is being used concomitantly for the treatment of HIV and HBV, \nadditional information relating to the use of lamivudine in the treatment of hepatitis B infection is \navailable in the Zeffix SmPC.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of zidovudine has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders.\n\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events.  In case of concomitant antiviral \ntherapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal \nproducts.\n\nIf Combivir is discontinued in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus, periodic monitoring of both \nliver function tests and markers of HBV replication for 4 months is recommended, as withdrawal of \nlamivudine may result in an acute exacerbation of hepatitis.\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy, and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis C virus: The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not \nrecommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.5).\n\nOsteonecrosis: Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis \nhave been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART).  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they \nexperience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\n\n\n6\n\nCombivir should not be taken with any other medicinal products containing lamivudine or medicinal \nproducts containing emtricitabine.\n\nThe combination of lamivudine with cladribine is not recommended (see section 4.5).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCombivir contains lamivudine and zidovudine, therefore any interactions identified for these \nindividually are relevant to Combivir. Clinical studies have shown that there are no clinically \nsignificant interactions between lamivudine and zidovudine.\n\nZidovudine is primarily metabolised by UGT enzymes; co-administration of inducers or inhibitors of \nUGT enzymes could alter zidovudine exposure. Lamivudine is cleared renally. Active renal secretion \nof lamivudine in the urine is mediated through organic cation transporters (OCTs); co-administration \nof lamivudine with OCT inhibitors or nephrotoxic drugs may increase lamivudine exposure.\n\nLamivudine and zidovudine are not significantly metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes (such as \nCYP 3A4, CYP 2C9 or CYP 2D6) nor do they inhibit or induce this enzyme system. Therefore, there \nis little potential for interactions with antiretroviral protease inhibitors, non-nucleosides and other \nmedicinal products metabolised by major P450 enzymes.\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.

If concomitant therapy with Combivir and any of \nthese medicinal products is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and \nhaematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.\nLimited data from clinical trials do not indicate a significantly increased risk of adverse reactions to \nzidovudine with cotrimoxazole (see interaction information above relating to lamivudine and co-\ntrimoxazole), aerosolised pentamidine, pyrimethamine and acyclovir at doses used in prophylaxis.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\nPregnancy\n\nAs a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account. In \nthe present case, the use in pregnant women of zidovudine, with subsequent treatment of the newborn \ninfants, has been shown to reduce the rate of maternal-foetal transmission of HIV.  A large amount of \ndata on pregnant women taking lamivudine or zidovudine indicate no malformative toxicity (more \nthan 3000 outcomes from first trimester exposure each, of which over 2000 outcomes involved \nexposure to both lamivudine and zidovudine). The malformative risk is unlikely in humans based on \nthe mentioned large amount of data.\n\nThe active ingredients of Combivir may inhibit cellular DNA replication and zidovudine has been \nshown to be transplacental carcinogen in one animal study (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of \nthese findings is unknown.\n\nFor patients co-infected with hepatitis who are being treated with lamivudine containing medicinal \nproducts such as Combivir and subsequently become pregnant, consideration should be given to the \npossibility of a recurrence of hepatitis on discontinuation of lamivudine.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction: nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and \nin vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nBoth lamivudine and zidovudine are excreted in breast milk at similar concentrations to those found in \nserum.  \n\nBased on more than 200 mother/child pairs treated for HIV, serum concentrations of lamivudine in \nbreastfed infants of mothers treated for HIV are very low (< 4% of maternal serum concentrations) and \nprogressively decrease to undetectable levels when breastfed infants reach 24 weeks of age. There are \nno data available on the safety of lamivudine when administered to babies less than three months old.\n\nAfter administration of a single dose of 200 mg zidovudine to HIV-infected women, the mean \nconcentration of zidovudine was similar in human milk and serum.\n\nIt is recommended that mothers infected by HIV do not breast-feed their infants under any \ncircumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.\n\nFertility\n\nNeither zidovudine nor lamivudine have shown evidence of impairment of fertility in studies in male \nand female rats. There are no data on their affect on human female fertility. \n\n\n\n10\n\nIn men zidovudine has not been shown to affect sperm count, morphology or motility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nAdverse reactions have been reported during therapy for HIV disease with lamivudine and zidovudine \nseparately or in combination.  For many of these events, it is unclear whether they are related to \nlamivudine, zidovudine, the wide range of medicinal products used in the management of HIV \ndisease, or as a result of the underlying disease process.\n\nAs Combivir contains lamivudine and zidovudine, the type and severity of adverse reactions \nassociated with each of the compounds may be expected.  There is no evidence of added toxicity \nfollowing concurrent administration of the two compounds.\n\nCases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic \nsteatosis, have been reported with the use of zidovudine (see section 4.4).\n\nTreatment with zidovudine has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat which is most evident in \nthe face, limbs and buttocks.  Patients receiving Combivir should be frequently examined and \nquestioned for signs of lipoatrophy. When such development is found, treatment with Combivir should \nnot be continued (see section 4.4).\n\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4)\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) \nhave also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to \nonset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).  \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nLamivudine: \n\nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to the treatment are listed below by body \nsystem, organ class and absolute frequency.

The most serious adverse \nreactions include anaemia (which may require transfusions), neutropenia and leucopenia.  These \noccurred more frequently at higher dosages (1200-1500 mg/day) and in patients with advanced HIV \ndisease (especially when there is poor bone marrow reserve prior to treatment), and particularly in \npatients with CD4 cell counts less than 100/mm3 (see section 4.4).\n\nThe incidence of neutropenia was also increased in those patients whose neutrophil counts, \nhaemoglobin levels and serum vitamin B12 levels were low at the start of zidovudine therapy.\n\nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to the treatment are listed below by body \nsystem, organ class and absolute frequency.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system\nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is limited experience of overdosage with Combivir.  No specific symptoms or signs have been \nidentified following acute overdose with zidovudine or lamivudine apart from those listed as \nundesirable effects.  No fatalities occurred, and all patients recovered.\n\n\n\n13\n\nIf overdosage occurs the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and \nstandard supportive treatment applied as necessary.  Since lamivudine is dialysable, continuous \nhaemodialysis could be used in the treatment of overdosage, although this has not been studied.  \nHaemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis appear to have a limited effect on elimination of zidovudine, but \nenhance the elimination of the glucuronide metabolite.  For more details physicians should refer to the \nindividual prescribing information for lamivudine and zidovudine.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, combinations, ATC Code: \nJ05AR01\n\nLamivudine and zidovudine are nucleoside analogues which have activity against HIV.  Additionally, \nlamivudine has activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV).  Both medicinal products are metabolised \nintracellularly to their active moieties, lamivudine 5’-triphosphate (TP) and zidovudine 5’-TP \nrespectively.  Their main modes of action are as chain terminators of viral reverse transcription.  \nLamivudine-TP and zidovudine-TP have selective inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 \nreplication in vitro; lamivudine is also active against zidovudine-resistant clinical isolates of HIV.  No \nantagonistic effects in vitro were seen with lamivudine and other antiretrovirals (tested agents: \nabacavir, didanosine and nevirapine). No antagonistic effects in vitro were seen with zidovudine and \nother antiretrovirals (tested agents: abacavir, didanosine and interferon-alpha).\n\nHIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184V amino acid change close to the \nactive site of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT).  This variant arises both in vitro and in HIV-1 \ninfected patients treated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral therapy.  M184V mutants display \ngreatly reduced susceptibility to lamivudine and show diminished viral replicative capacity in vitro. In \nvitro studies indicate that zidovudine-resistant virus isolates can become zidovudine sensitive when \nthey simultaneously acquire resistance to lamivudine.  The clinical relevance of such findings remains, \nhowever, not well defined.\n\nIn vitro data tend to suggest that the continuation of lamivudine in antiretroviral regimen despite the \ndevelopment of M184V might provide residual antiretroviral activity (likely through impaired viral \nfitness).  The clinical relevance of these findings is not established.  Indeed, the available clinical data \nare very limited and preclude any reliable conclusion in the field.  In any case, initiation of susceptible \nNRTI’s should always be preferred to maintenance of lamivudine therapy.  Therefore, maintaining \nlamivudine therapy despite emergence of M184V mutation should only be considered in cases where \nno other active NRTIs are available\n\nCross-resistance conferred by the M184V RT is limited within the nucleoside inhibitor class of \nantiretroviral agents.  Zidovudine and stavudine maintain their antiretroviral activities against \nlamivudine-resistant HIV-1.  Abacavir maintains its antiretroviral activities against lamivudine-\nresistant HIV-1 harbouring only the M184V mutation.  The M184V RT mutant shows a <4-fold \ndecrease in susceptibility to didanosine; the clinical significance of these findings is unknown.  In vitro\nsusceptibility testing has not been standardised and results may vary according to methodological \nfactors.\n\nLamivudine demonstrates low cytotoxicity to peripheral blood lymphocytes, to established \nlymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage cell lines, and to a variety of bone marrow progenitor cells in \nvitro.  Resistance to thymidine analogues (of which zidovudine is one) is well characterised and is \nconferred by the stepwise accumulation of up to six specific mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase \nat codons 41, 67, 70, 210, 215 and 219.  Viruses acquire phenotypic resistance to thymidine analogues \nthrough the combination of mutations at codons 41 and 215 or by the accumulation of at least four of \nthe six mutations.  These thymidine analogue mutations alone do not cause high-level cross-resistance \n\n\n\n14\n\nto any of the other nucleosides, allowing for the subsequent use of any of the other approved reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors.\n\nTwo patterns of multi-drug resistance mutations, the first characterised by mutations in the HIV \nreverse transcriptase at codons 62, 75, 77, 116 and 151 and the second involving a T69S mutation plus \na 6-base pair insert at the same position, result in phenotypic resistance to AZT as well as to the other \napproved NRTIs.  Either of these two patterns of multinucleoside resistance mutations severely limits \nfuture therapeutic options.\n\nClinical Experience\n\nIn clinical trials, lamivudine in combination with zidovudine has been shown to reduce HIV-1 viral \nload and increase CD4 cell count.  Clinical end-point data indicate that lamivudine in combination \nwith zidovudine, results in a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression and mortality.\n\nLamivudine and zidovudine have been widely used as components of antiretroviral combination \ntherapy with other antiretroviral agents of the same class (NRTIs) or different classes (PIs, non-\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors).\n\nMultiple drug antiretroviral therapy containing lamivudine has been shown to be effective in \nantiretrovirally-naive patients as well as in patients presenting with viruses containing the M184V \nmutations.\n\nEvidence from clinical studies shows that lamivudine plus zidovudine delays the emergence of \nzidovudine resistant isolates in individuals with no prior antiretroviral therapy.  Subjects receiving \nlamivudine and zidovudine with or without additional concomitant antiretroviral therapies and who \nalready present with the M184V mutant virus also experience a delay in the onset of mutations that \nconfer resistance to zidovudine and stavudine (Thymidine Analogue Mutations; TAMs).\n\nThe relationship between in vitro susceptibility of HIV to lamivudine and zidovudine and clinical \nresponse to lamivudine/zidovudine containing therapy remains under investigation.\n\nLamivudine at a dose of 100 mg once daily has also been shown to be effective for the treatment of \nadult patients with chronic HBV infection (for details of clinical studies, see the prescribing \ninformation for Zeffix).  However, for the treatment of HIV infection only a 300 mg daily dose of \nlamivudine (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) has been shown to be efficacious.\n\nLamivudine has not been specifically investigated in HIV patients co-infected with HBV.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nLamivudine and zidovudine are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  The bioavailability of \noral lamivudine in adults is normally between 80–85% and for zidovudine 60–70%.\n\nA bioequivalence study compared Combivir with lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg tablets \ntaken together.  The effect of food on the rate and extent of absorption was also studied.  Combivir \nwas shown to be bioequivalent to lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg given as separate \ntablets, when administered to fasting subjects.\n\nFollowing single dose Combivir administration in healthy volunteers, mean (CV) lamivudine and \nzidovudine Cmax values were 1.6 µg/ml (32%) and 2.0 µg/ml (40%), respectively and the \ncorresponding values for AUC were 6.1 µg h/ml (20%) and 2.4 µg h/ml (29%) respectively.  The \nmedian (range) lamivudine and zidovudine tmax values were 0.75 (0.50-2.00) hours and 0.50 (0.25-\n2.00) hours respectively.  The extent of lamivudine and zidovudine absorption (AUC) and estimates \nof half-life following administration of Combivir with food were similar when compared to fasting \n\n\n\n15\n\nsubjects, although the rates of absorption (Cmax, tmax) were slowed.  Based on these data Combivir may \nbe administered with or without food.\n\nAdministration of crushed tablets with a small amount of semi-solid food or liquid would not be \nexpected to have an impact on the pharmaceutical quality, and would therefore not be expected to alter \nthe clinical effect.  This conclusion is based on the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic data \nassuming that the patient crushes and transfers 100% of the tablet and ingests immediately. \n\nDistribution\n\nIntravenous studies with lamivudine and zidovudine showed that the mean apparent volume of \ndistribution is 1.3 and 1.6 l/kg respectively.  Lamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the \ntherapeutic dose range and displays limited binding to the major plasma protein albumin (<36% serum \nalbumin in vitro).  Zidovudine plasma protein binding is 34% to 38%.  Interactions involving binding \nsite displacement are not anticipated with Combivir.\n\nData show that lamivudine and zidovudine penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) and reach the \ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  The mean ratios of CSF/serum lamivudine and zidovudine concentrations \n2-4 hours after oral administration were approximately 0.12 and 0.5 respectively.  The true extent of \nCNS penetration of lamivudine and its relationship with any clinical efficacy is unknown.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nMetabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination.  Lamivudine is predominately cleared \nunchanged by renal excretion.  The likelihood of metabolic drug interactions with lamivudine is low \ndue to the small extent of hepatic metabolism (5-10%) and low plasma binding.\n\nThe 5’-glucuronide of zidovudine is the major metabolite in both plasma and urine, accounting for \napproximately 50–80% of the administered dose eliminated by renal excretion.  3’-amino-3’-\ndeoxythymidine (AMT) has been identified as a metabolite of zidovudine following intravenous \ndosing.\n\nElimination\n\nThe observed lamivudine half-life of elimination is 5 to 7 hours.  The mean systemic clearance of \nlamivudine is approximately 0.32 l/h/kg, with predominantly renal clearance (>70%) via the organic \ncationic transport system.  Studies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is \naffected by renal dysfunction.  Dose reduction is required for patients with creatinine clearance \n50 ml/min (see section 4.2).\n\nFrom studies with intravenous zidovudine, the mean terminal plasma half-life was 1.1 hours and the \nmean systemic clearance was 1.6 l/h/kg.  Renal clearance of zidovudine is estimated to be 0.34 l/h/kg, \nindicating glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion by the kidneys.  Zidovudine concentrations \nare increased in patients with advanced renal failure.\n\nPharmacokinetics in children: In children over the age of 5-6 months, the pharmacokinetic profile of \nzidovudine is similar to that in adults.  Zidovudine is well absorbed from the gut and at all dose levels \nstudied in adults and children, the bioavailability was between 60-74% with a mean of 65%. Cssmax\nlevels were 4.45 M (1.19 g/ml) following a dose of 120 mg zidovudine (in solution)/m2 body \nsurface area and 7.7 M (2.06 g/ml) at 180 mg/m2 body surface area.  Dosages of 180 mg/m2 four \ntimes daily in children produced similar systemic exposure (24 hour AUC 40.0 h M or 10.7 h g/ml) \nas doses of 200 mg six times daily in adults (40.7 h M or 10.9 h g/ml).\n\nIn six HIV-infected children from 2 to 13 years of age, zidovudine plasma pharmacokinetics were \nevaluated while subjects were receiving 120 mg/m2 zidovudine three times daily and again after \nswitching to 180 mg/m2 twice daily.  Systemic exposures (daily AUC and Cmax) in plasma from the \n\n\n\n16\n\ntwice daily regimen appeared equivalent to those from the same total daily dose given in three divided \ndoses [Bergshoeff, 2004].\n\nIn general, lamivudine pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients are similar to adults.  However, \nabsolute bioavailability (approximately 55-65%) was reduced in paediatric patients below 12 years of \nage.  In addition, systemic clearance values were greater in younger paediatric patients and decreased \nwith age, approaching adult values around 12 years of age.  Due to these differences, the \nrecommended dose for lamivudine in children (aged more than three months and weighing less than \n30 kg) is 4 mg/kg twice a day.  This dose will achieve an average AUC0-12 ranging from approximately \n3,800 to 5,300 ng h/ml.  Recent findings indicate that exposure in children <6 years of age may be \nreduced by about 30% compared with other age groups.  Further data addressing this issue are \ncurrently awaited.  At present, the available data do not suggest that lamivudine is less efficacious in \nthis age group.\n\nPharmacokinetics in pregnancy: The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine and zidovudine were similar to \nthat of non-pregnant women.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe clinically relevant effects of lamivudine and zidovudine in combination are anaemia, neutropenia \nand leucopenia.\n\nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity\n\nNeither lamivudine nor zidovudine are mutagenic in bacterial tests, but consistent with other \nnucleoside analogues, inhibit cellular DNA replication in in vitro mammalian tests such as the mouse \nlymphoma assay.\n\nLamivudine has not shown any genotoxic activity in in vivo studies at doses that gave plasma \nconcentrations up to 40-50 times higher than clinical plasma levels.  Zidovudine showed clastogenic \neffects in an oral repeated dose micronucleus test in mice.  Peripheral blood lymphocytes from AIDS \npatients receiving zidovudine treatment have also been observed to contain higher numbers of \nchromosome breakages.\n\nA pilot study has demonstrated that zidovudine is incorporated into leukocyte nuclear DNA of adults, \nincluding pregnant women, taking zidovudine as treatment for HIV-1 infection, or for the prevention \nof mother to child viral transmission.  Zidovudine was also incorporated into DNA from cord blood \nleukocytes of infants from zidovudine-treated mothers. A transplacental genotoxicity study conducted \nin monkeys compared zidovudine alone with the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine at human-\nequivalent exposures.  The study demonstrated that foetuses exposed in utero to the combination \nsustained a higher level of nucleoside analogue-DNA incorporation into multiple foetal organs, and \nshowed evidence of more telomere shortening than in those exposed to zidovudine alone.  The clinical \nsignificance of these findings is unknown.\n\nThe carcinogenic potential of a combination of lamivudine and zidovudine has not been tested.\n\nIn long-term oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, lamivudine did not show any carcinogenic \npotential.\n\nIn oral carcinogenicity studies with zidovudine in mice and rats, late appearing vaginal epithelial \ntumours were observed.  A subsequent intravaginal carcinogenicity study confirmed the hypothesis \nthat the vaginal tumours were the result of long term local exposure of the rodent vaginal epithelium to \nhigh concentrations of unmetabolised zidovudine in urine.  There were no other zidovudine-related \ntumours observed in either sex of either species.\n\nIn addition, two transplacental carcinogenicity studies have been conducted in mice. In one study, by \nthe US National Cancer Institute, zidovudine was administered at maximum tolerated doses to \n\n\n\n17\n\npregnant mice from day 12 to 18 of gestation.  One year post-natally, there was an increase in the \nincidence of tumours in the lung, liver and female reproductive tract of offspring exposed to the \nhighest dose level (420 mg/kg term body weight).\n\nIn a second study, mice were administered zidovudine at doses up to 40 mg/kg for 24 months, with \nexposure beginning prenatally on gestation day 10.  Treatment related findings were limited to late-\noccurring vaginal epithelial tumours, which were seen with a similar incidence and time of onset as in \nthe standard oral carcinogenicity study.  The second study thus provided no evidence that zidovudine \nacts as a transplacental carcinogen.\n\nWhile the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown, these data suggest that a carcinogenic risk \nto humans is outweighed by the potential clinical benefit.\n\nIn reproductive toxicity studies lamivudine has demonstrated evidence of causing an increase in early \nembryonic deaths in the rabbit at relatively low systemic exposures, comparable to those achieved in \nman, but not in the rat even at very high systemic exposure.  Zidovudine had a similar effect in both \nspecies, but only at very high systemic exposures.  Lamivudine was not teratogenic in animal studies.  \nAt maternally toxic doses, zidovudine given to rats during organogenesis resulted in an increased \nincidence of malformations, but no evidence of foetal abnormalities was observed at lower doses.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n31\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nCombivir 150 mg/300 mg film-coated tablets\nlamivudine/zidovudine\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\n Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again.\n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n If you get any of the side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n\n1. What Combivir is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Combivir\n3. How to take Combivir\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Combivir\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Combivir is and what it is used for\n\nCombivir is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection in adults and children.\n\nCombivir contains two active ingredients that are used to treat HIV infection: lamivudine and \nzidovudine. Both of these belong to a group of antiretroviral medicines called nucleoside analogue \nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).\n\nCombivir does not completely cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body, and \nkeeps it at a low level. It also increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white \nblood cells that are important in helping your body to fight infection.\n\nNot everyone responds to treatment with Combivir in the same way.  Your doctor will monitor the \neffectiveness of your treatment.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Combivir\n\nDo not take Combivir: \n\n if you are allergic to lamivudine or zidovudine, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine\n(listed in section 6)\n\n if you have a very low red blood cell count (anaemia) or a very low white blood cell count \n(neutropenia).\n\nCheck with your doctor if you think any of these apply to you.\n\nTake special care with Combivir\n\nSome people taking Combivir or other combination treatments for HIV are more at risk of serious side \neffects. You need to be aware of the extra risks:\n\n\n\n32\n\n if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B \ninfection, do not stop Combivir without your doctor’s advice, as your hepatitis may come back)\n\n if you have kidney disease\n if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman)\n\nTalk to your doctor if any of these apply to you.  Your doctor will decide if the active \nsubstances are suitable for you. You may need extra check-ups, including blood tests, while you \nare taking your medicine. See Section 4 for more information.\n\nLook out for important symptoms\nSome people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. You \nneed to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Combivir.  \n\nRead the information ‘Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV’ in \nSection 4 of this leaflet.\n\nProtect other people \nHIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of \ninfected blood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You can still pass on HIV when taking this \nmedicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy.  \n\nDiscuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nOther medicines and Combivir\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or if you have taken any \nrecently, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.\n\nRemember to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you are taking \nCombivir.\n\nThese medicines should not be used with Combivir:\n other medicinal products containing lamivudine, to treat HIV infection or hepatitis B infection\n emtricitabine, to treat HIV infection\n stavudine, to treat HIV infection\n ribavirin or injections of ganciclovir to treat viral infections\n high doses of co-trimoxazole, an antibiotic\n cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia\n\nTell your doctor if you are being treated with any of these.\n\nSome medicines can make it more likely that you’ll have side effects, or make side effects worse. \nThese include:\n sodium valproate, to treat epilepsy\n interferon, to treat viral infections\n pyrimethamine, to treat malaria and other parasitic infections\n dapsone, to prevent pneumonia and treat skin infections\n fluconazole or flucytosine, to treat fungal infections such as candida\n pentamidine or atovaquone to treat parasitic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n          (often referred to as PCP)\n amphotericin or co-trimoxazole, to treat fungal and bacterial infections\n probenecid, to treat gout and similar conditions, and given with some antibiotics to make them \n\nmore effective\n methadone, used as a heroin substitute\n vincristine, vinblastine or doxorubicin, to treat cancer.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of these.\n\nSome medicines interact with Combivir\n\n\n\n33\n\nThese include:\n clarithromycin, an antibiotic\n\nif you are taking clarithromycin, take your dose at least 2 hours before or after you take your \nCombivir.\n\n phenytoin, for treating epilepsy.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking phenytoin.  Your doctor may need to monitor you while you \nare taking Combivir.\n\n medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, \nmannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly.\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are being treated with any of these.\n\nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, if you become pregnant or if you are planning to become pregnant talk to your \ndoctor about the risks and benefits to you and your baby of taking Combivir.\n\nCombivir and similar medicines may cause side effects in unborn babies. If you have taken Combivir\nduring your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to \nmonitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the \nbenefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side effects.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breastfeed, because HIV infection can be passed on to the \nbaby in breast milk.  \n\nA small amount of the ingredients in Combivir can also pass into your breast-milk.\n\nIf you’re breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding:\n\nTalk to your doctor immediately.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nCombivir can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert.\n\nDo not drive or operate machines unless you are feeling well.\n\n3. How to take Combivir \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\nSwallow Combivir tablets, with some water.  Combivir can be taken with or without food.\n\nIf you cannot swallow the tablets whole, you may crush and combine them with a small amount of \nfood or drink, and take all the dose immediately.\n\nStay in regular contact with your doctor\nCombivir helps to control your condition.  You need to keep taking it every day to stop your illness \ngetting worse. You may still develop other infections and illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\n\n\n34\n\nKeep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Combivir without your doctor’s \nadvice.\n\nHow much to take\n\nAdults and adolescents 30 kg or more\n\nThe usual dose of Combivir is one tablet twice a day.\n\nTake the tablets at regular times, leaving approximately 12 hours between each tablet.\n\nChildren who weigh between 21 and 30 kg\n\nThe usual starting dose of Combivir is one half tablet (½) taken in the morning and one whole tablet \ntaken in the evening.\n\nChildren who weigh between 14 and 21 kg\n\nThe usual starting dose of Combivir is one half tablet (½) taken in the morning and one half tablet (½) \ntaken in the evening.\n\nFor children who weigh less than 14 kg lamivudine and zidovudine (the ingredients of Combivir) \nshould be taken separately.  \n\nIf you take more Combivir than you should\n\nIf you accidentally take too much Combivir, tell your doctor or your pharmacist, or contact your \nnearest hospital emergency department for further advice.\n\nIf you forget to take Combivir\n\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue your treatment as before.  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n\nTreatment with Combivir often causes a loss of fat from legs, arms and face (lipoatrophy). This loss of \nbody fat has been shown to be not fully reversible after discontinuation of zidovudine. Your doctor \nshould monitor for signs of lipoatrophy. Tell your doctor if you notice any loss of fat from your legs, \narms, and face. When these signs occur, Combivir should be stopped and your HIV treatment \nchanged.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them.\n\nWhen you are being treated for HIV, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of \nCombivir or other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the HIV disease itself. So it is very \nimportant to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health.\n\nAs well as the side effects listed below for Combivir, other conditions can develop during \ncombination therapy for HIV. \n\nIt is important to read the information later in this section under ‘Other possible side effects of \ncombination therapy for HIV’.\n\nVery common side effects\nThese may affect more than than 1 in 10 people:\n\n\n\n35\n\n headache \n feeling sick (nausea).\n\nCommon side effects\nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people:\n being sick (vomiting)\n diarrhoea\n stomach pains\n loss of appetite\n feeling dizzy\n tiredness, lack of energy\n fever (high temperature)\n general feeling of being unwell\n difficulty in sleeping (insomnia)\n muscle pain and discomfort\n joint pain\n cough\n irritated or runny nose\n skin rash\n hair loss (alopecia).\n\nCommon side effects that might show up in blood tests are:\n a low red blood cell count (anaemia) or low white blood cell count (neutropenia or leucopenia)\n an increase in the level of liver enzymes\n an increased amount in the blood of bilirubin (a substance produced in the liver) which may make \n\nyour skin appear yellow.\n\nUncommon side effects\nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n feeling breathless\n wind (flatulence)\n itching\n muscle weakness.\n\nAn uncommon side effect that may show up in blood test is:\n a decrease in the number of cells involved in blood clotting (thrombocytopenia) or in all kinds of \n\nblood cells (pancytopenia).\n\nRare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1000 people:\n serious allergic reaction causing swelling of the face, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty \n\nin swallowing or breathing\n liver disorders, such as jaundice, enlarged liver or fatty liver, inflammation (hepatitis)\n lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood; see the next section, ‘Other possible side effects of \n\ncombination therapy for HIV’)\n inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n chest pain; disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)\n fits (convulsions)\n feeling depressed or anxious, not being able to concentrate, feeling drowsy\n indigestion, taste disturbance\n changes in the colour of your nails, your skin or the skin inside your mouth\n a flu-like feeling – chills and sweating\n tingly feelings in the skin (pins and needles)\n sensation of weakness in the limbs\n breakdown of muscle tissue\n\n\n\n36\n\n numbness\n passing urine more often\n enlarged breasts in men.\n\nRare side effects that may show up in blood tests are:\n an increase in an enzyme called amylase\n a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells (pure red cell aplasia).\n\nVery rare side effects\nThese may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people:\n\nA very rare side effect that may show up in blood tests is:\n a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red or white blood cells (aplastic anaemia).\n\nIf you get side effects\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects get severe or troublesome, or if you \nnotice any side effects not listed in this leaflet.\n\nOther possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV\nCombination therapy such as Combivir may cause other conditions to develop during HIV treatment.\n\nOld infections may flare up\n\nPeople with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to \ndevelop serious infections (opportunistic infections).  When these people start treatment, they may \nfind that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation.  These \nsymptoms are probably caused by the body’s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body \nstarts to fight these infections.\n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nIf you get any symptoms of infection while you are taking Combivir:\n\nTell your doctor immediately.  Do not take other medicines for the infection without your \ndoctor’s advice.\n\nLactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect\n\nSome people taking Combivir develop a condition called lactic acidosis, together with an enlarged \nliver.\n\nLactic acidosis is caused by a build up of lactic acid in the body. It is rare; if it happens, it usually \ndevelops after a few months of treatment. It can be life-threatening, causing failure of internal organs. \nLactic acidosis is more likely to develop in people who have liver disease, or in obese (very \noverweight) people, especially women.\n\nSigns of lactic acidosis include:\n deep, rapid, difficult breathing\n drowsiness\n numbness or weakness in the limbs\n feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting)\n stomach pain.\n\n\n\n37\n\nDuring your treatment, your doctor will monitor you for signs of lactic acidosis.  If you have any of \nthe symptoms listed above, or any other symptoms that worry you:\n\nSee your doctor as soon as possible.\n\nYou may have problems with your bones\n\nSome people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this \ncondition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be \nmore likely to get this condition:\n if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time\n if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids\n if they drink alcohol\n if their immune systems are very weak\n if they are overweight.\n\nSigns of osteonecrosis include:\n stiffness in the joints\n aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder)\n difficulty moving.\nIf you notice any of these symptoms:\n\nTell your doctor.\n\nOther effects may show up in blood tests\n\nCombination therapy for HIV can also cause:\n increased levels of lactic acid in the blood, which on rare occasions can lead to lactic acidosis\n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5. How to store Combivir\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton.\n\nDo not store above 30oC.\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.  These measures will help to protect the environment.\n\n6.
