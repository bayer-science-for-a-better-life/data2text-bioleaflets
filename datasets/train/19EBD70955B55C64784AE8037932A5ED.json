NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nIbandronic acid Sandoz 50 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 50 mg of ibandronic acid (as ibandronate sodium monohydrate).\n\nExcipient with known effect:\nEach film-coated tablet contains 0.86 mg lactose (as lactose monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablets.\nWhite round biconvex tablets\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nIbandronic acid Sandoz is indicated in adults for the prevention of skeletal events (pathological\nfractures, bone complications requiring radiotherapy or surgery) in patients with breast cancer and\nbone metastases.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nIbandronic acid Sandoz therapy should only be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of\ncancer.\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is one 50 mg film-coated tablet daily.\n\nSpecial populations\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr \u226550 and <80 mL/min).\n\nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr \u226530 and <50 mL/min) a dosage adjustment to one\n50 mg film-coated tablet every second day is recommended (see section 5.2).\n\nFor patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) the recommended dose is one 50 mg\nfilm-coated tablet once weekly. See dosing instructions, above.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of ibandronic acid in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have\nnot been established. No data are available (see section 5.1 and 5.2).\n\n\n\n3\n\nMethod of administration\nFor oral use.\n\nIbandronic acid Sandoz tablets should be taken after an overnight fast (at least 6 hours) and before the\nfirst food or drink of the day. Medicinal products and supplements (including calcium) should\nsimilarly be avoided prior to taking Ibandronic acid Sandoz tablets. Fasting should be continued for at\nleast 30 minutes after taking the tablet. Water may be taken at any time during the course of\nIbandronic acid Sandoz treatment (see section 4.5). Water with a high concentration of calcium should\nnot be used. If there is concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard\nwater), it is advised to use bottled water with a low mineral content.\n\n- The tablets should be swallowed whole with a full glass of water (180 to 240 ml) while the\npatient is standing or sitting in an upright position.\n\n- Patients should not lie down for 60 minutes after taking Ibandronic acid Sandoz.\n- Patients should not chew, suck or crush the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal\n\nulceration.\n- Water is the only drink that should be taken with Ibandronic acid Sandoz.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Abnormalities of the oesophagus which delay oesophageal emptying such as stricture or\nachalasia\n\n- Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes\n- Hypocalcaemia\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPatients with disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism\nHypocalcaemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be effectively treated\nbefore starting Ibandronic acid Sandoz therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is\nimportant in all patients. Patients should receive supplemental calcium and/or vitamin D if dietary\nintake is inadequate.\n\nGastrointestinal irritation\nOrally administered bisphosphonates may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa.\nBecause of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease,\ncaution should be used when Ibandronic acid Sandoz is given to patients with active upper\ngastrointestinal problems (e.g. known Barrett\u2019s oesophagus, dysphagia, other oesophageal diseases,\ngastritis, duodenitis or ulcers).\n\nAdverse experiences such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, in some\ncases severe and requiring hospitalization, rarely with bleeding or followed by oesophageal stricture or\nperforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. The risk of\nsevere oesophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who do not comply with the\ndosing instruction and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms\nsuggestive of oesophageal irritation. Patients should pay particular attention and be able to comply\nwith the dosing instructions (see section 4.2).\n\nPhysicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible oesophageal reaction and\npatients should be instructed to discontinue Ibandronic acid Sandoz and seek medical attention if they\ndevelop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn.\n\nWhile no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials there have been post-marketing\nreports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with\ncomplications.\n\n\n\n4\n\nAcetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs\nSince Acetylsalicylic acid, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) and\nbisphosphonates are associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during\nconcomitant administration.\n\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported very rarely in the post marketing setting in patients\nreceiving ibandronic acid for oncology indications (see section 4.8).\n\nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed\nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth.\n\nA dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is\nrecommended prior to treatment with Ibandronic acid Sandoz in patients with concomitant risk factors.\n\nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient\u2019s risk of developing ONJ:\n- Potency of the medicinal product that inhibit bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent\n\ncompounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative\ndose of bone resorption therapy\n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking\n- Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to\n\nhead and neck\n- Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease,\n\ninvasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions\n\nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups,\nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of\nsores or discharge during treatment with Ibandronic acid Sandoz. While on treatment, invasive dental\nprocedures should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to\nIbandronic acid Sandoz administration.\n\nThe management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration\nbetween the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary\ninterruption of Ibandronic acid Sandoz treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and\ncontributing risk factors are mitigated where possible.\n\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal\nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in\nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory\ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The\npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving\nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections.\n\nAtypical fractures of the femur\nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate\ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short\noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just\nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients\nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to\nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the\ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a\nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported.\n\nDiscontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture\nshould be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment.\n\n\n\n5\n\nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and\nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture.\n\nRenal function\nClinical studies have not shown any evidence of deterioration in renal function with long term\nibandronic acid therapy. Nevertheless, according to clinical assessment of the individual patient, it is\nrecommended that renal function, serum calcium, phosphate and magnesium should be monitored in\npatients treated with ibandronic acid.\n\nRare hereditary problems\nIbandronic acid Sandoz tablets contain lactose and should not be administered to patients with rare\nhereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose\nmalabsorption.\n\nPatients with known hypersensitivity to other bisphosphonates\nCaution is to be taken in patients with known hypersensitivity to other bisphosphonates.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nMedicinal product-Food Interactions\nProducts containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron),\nincluding milk and food, are likely to interfere with absorption of Ibandronic acid Sandoz tablets.\nTherefore, with such products, including food, intake must be delayed at least 30 minutes following\noral administration.\n\nBioavailability was reduced by approximately 75% when ibandronic acid tablets were administered 2\nhours after a standard meal. Therefore, it is recommended that the tablets should be taken after an\novernight fast (at least 6 hours) and fasting should continue for at least 30 minutes after the dose has\nbeen taken (see section 4.2).\n\nInteractions with other medicinal products\nMetabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major\nhuman hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450\nsystem in rats (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not\nundergo any biotransformation.\n\nH2-antagonists or other medicinal products that increase gastric pH.\nIn healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, intravenous ranitidine caused an increase in\nibandronic acid bioavailability of about 20% (which is within the normal variability of the\nbioavailability of ibandronic acid), probably as a result of reduced gastric acidity. However, no dosage\nadjustment is required when ibandronic acid is administered with H2-antagonists or medicinal products\nthat increase gastric pH.\n\nAcetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs\nSince Acetylsalicylic acid, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) and\nbisphosphonates are associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during\nconcomitant administration (see section 4.4).\n\nAminoglycosides\nCaution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since both\nsubstances can lower serum calcium levels for prolonged periods. Attention should also be paid to the\npossible existence of simultaneous hypomagnesaemia.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\n\n\n6\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of ibandronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in rats have\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore,\nibandronic acid should not be used during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats have\ndemonstrated the presence of low levels of ibandronic acid in the milk following intravenous\nadministration. Ibandronic acid should not be used during lactation.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data on the effects of ibandronic acid in humans. In reproductive studies in rats by the\noral route, ibandronic acid decreased fertility. In studies in rats using the intravenous route, ibandronic\nacid decreased fertility at high daily doses (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nOn the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and reported adverse reactions, it is\nexpected that ibandronic acid has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most serious reported adverse reactions are anaphylactic reaction/shock, atypical fractures of the\nfemur, osteonecrosis of the jaw, gastrointestinal irritation, and ocular inflammation (see paragraph\n\u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d and section 4.4).Treatment was most frequently associated\nwith a decrease in serum calcium to below normal range (hypocalcaemia), followed by dyspepsia.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 1 lists adverse reactions from 2 pivotal phase III studies (Prevention of skeletal events in\npatients with breast cancer and bone metastases: 286 patients treated with Ibandronic acid Sandoz\n50 mg administered orally), and from post-marketing experience.\n\nAdverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category.\nFrequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u2265\n1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1 Adverse Drug Reactions Reported for Oral Administration of Ibandronic acid\nSystem Organ\nClass\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not known\n\nBlood and\nlymphatic\nsystem\ndisorders\n\nAnaemia\n\nImmune system\ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity\u2020,\nbronchospasm\u2020,\nangioedema\u2020,\nAnaphylactic\nreaction/shock\u2020**\n\nAsthma\nexacerbation\n\nMetabolism and\nnutrition\ndisorders\n\nHypocalcaemia**\n\nNervous system\ndisorders\n\nParaesthesia,\ndysgeusia\n(taste\nperversion)\n\n\n\n7\n\nSystem Organ\nClass\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare Not known\n\nEye disorders Ocular\ninflammation\u2020**\n\nGastrointestinal\ndisorders\n\nOesophagitis,\nabdominal pain,\ndyspepsia, nausea\n\nHaemorrhage,\nduodenal\nulcer, gastritis,\ndysphagia,\ndry mouth\n\nSkin and\nsubcutaneous\ntissue disorders\n\nPruritus Stevens-Johnson\nSyndrome\u2020,\nErythema\nMultiforme\u2020,\nDermatitis\nBullous\u2020\n\nMusculoskeletal\nand connective\ntissue disorders\n\nAtypical\nsubtrochanteric\nand diaphyseal\nfemoral\nfractures\u2020\n\nOsteonecrosis of\njaw\u2020**,\nosteonecrosis of\nthe external\nauditory canal\n(bisphosphonate\nclass adverse\nreaction) \u2020\n\nRenal and\nurinary\ndisorders\n\nAzotaemia\n(uraemia)\n\nGeneral\ndisorders and\nadministration\nsite conditions\n\nAsthenia Chest pain,\ninfluenza-like\nillness,\nmalaise, pain\n\nInvestigations Blood\nparathyroid\nhormone\nincreased\n\n**See further information below\n\u2020Identified in post-marketing experience.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nHypocalcaemia\nDecreased renal calcium excretion may be accompanied by a fall in serum phosphate levels not\nrequiring therapeutic measures. The serum calcium level may fall to hypocalcaemic values.\n\nOsteonecrosis of jaw\nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with\nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as ibandronic acid (see section 4.4.) Cases of\nONJ have been reported in the post marketing setting for ibandronic acid.\n\nOcular inflammation\nOcular inflammation events such as uveitis, episcleritis and scleritis have been reported with\nibandronic acid. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the ibandronic acid was discontinued.\n\nAnaphylactic reaction/shock\nCases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated\nwith intravenous ibandronic acid.\n\n\n\n8\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system\nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with ibandronic acid. However,\noral overdosage may result in upper gastrointestinal events, such as upset stomach, heartburn,\noesophagitis, gastritis or ulcer. Milk or antacids should be given to bind ibandronic acid. Due to the\nrisk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully\nupright.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, Bisphosphonates,\nATC Code: M05BA06.\n\nIbandronic acid belongs to the bisphosphonate group of compounds which act specifically on bone.\nTheir selective action on bone tissue is based on the high affinity of bisphosphonates for bone mineral.\nBisphosphonates act by inhibiting osteoclast activity, although the precise mechanism is still not clear.\n\nIn vivo, ibandronic acid prevents experimentally-induced bone destruction caused by cessation of\ngonadal function, retinoids, tumours or tumour extracts. The inhibition of endogenous bone resorption\nhas also been documented by 45Ca kinetic studies and by the release of radioactive tetracycline\npreviously incorporated into the skeleton.\n\nAt doses that were considerably higher than the pharmacologically effective doses, ibandronic acid did\nnot have any effect on bone mineralisation.\n\nBone resorption due to malignant disease is characterized by excessive bone resorption that is not\nbalanced with appropriate bone formation. Ibandronic acid selectively inhibits osteoclast activity,\nreducing bone resorption and thereby reducing skeletal complications of the malignant disease.\n\nClinical studies in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases have shown that there is a dose\ndependent inhibitory effect on bone osteolysis, expressed by markers of bone resorption, and a dose\ndependent effect on skeletal events.\n\nPrevention of skeletal events in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases with ibandronic acid\n50 mg tablets was assessed in two randomized placebo controlled phase III trials with a duration of 96\nweeks. Female patients with breast cancer and radiologically confirmed bone metastases were\nrandomised to receive placebo (277 patients) or 50 mg ibandronic acid (287 patients). The results from\nthese trials are summarised below.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoints\nThe primary endpoint of the trials was the skeletal morbidity period rate (SMPR). This was a\ncomposite endpoint which had the following skeletal related events (SREs) as sub-components:\n\n- radiotherapy to bone for treatment of fractures/impending fractures\n- surgery to bone for treatment of fractures\n- vertebral fractures\n- non-vertebral fractures\n\n\n\n9\n\nThe analysis of the SMPR was time-adjusted and considered that one or more events occurring in a\nsingle 12 week period could be potentially related. Multiple events were therefore, counted only once\nin any given 12 week period for the purposes of the analysis. Pooled data from these studies\ndemonstrated a significant advantage for ibandronic acid 50 mg p.o. over placebo in the reduction in\nSREs measured by the SMPR (p=0.041). There was also a 38% reduction in the risk of developing an\nSRE for ibandronic acid treated patients when compared with placebo (relative risk 0.62, p=0.003).\nEfficacy results are summarised in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Efficacy Results (Breast Cancer Patients with Metastatic Bone Disease)\n\nAll Skeletal Related Events (SREs)\nPlacebo\nn=277\n\nIbandronic acid\n50 mg\nn=287\n\np-value\n\nSMPR (per patient year) 1.15 0.99 p=0.041\n\nSRE relative risk - 0.62 p=0.003\n\nSecondary Efficacy Endpoints\nA statistically significant improvement in bone pain score was shown for ibandronic acid 50 mg\ncompared to placebo. The pain reduction was consistently below baseline throughout the entire study\nand accompanied by a significantly reduced use of analgesics compared to placebo. The deterioration\nin Quality of Life and WHO performance status was significantly less in ibandronic acid treated\npatients compared with placebo. Urinary concentrations of the bone resorption marker CTx (C-\nterminal telopeptide released from Type I collagen) were significantly reduced in the ibandronic acid\ngroup compared to placebo. This reduction in urinary CTx levels was significantly correlated with the\nprimary efficacy endpoint SMPR (Kendall-tau-b (p<0.001)). A tabular summary of the secondary\nefficacy results is presented in Table 3.\n\nTable 3 Secondary Efficacy Results (Breast Cancer Patients with Metastatic Bone Disease)\n\nPlacebo\nn=277\n\nIbandronic acid\n50 mg\nn=287\n\np-value\n\nBone pain * 0.20 -0.10 p=0.001\n\nAnalgesic use * 0.85 0.60 p=0.019\n\nQuality of Life * -26.8 -8.3 p=0.032\n\nWHO performance score * 0.54 0.33 p=0.008\n\nUrinary CTx ** 10.95 -77.32 p=0.001\n\n* Mean change from baseline to last assessment.\n** Median change from baseline to last assessment\n\nPaediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.2)\nThe safety and efficacy of ibandronic acid in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have\nnot been established. No data are available.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe absorption of ibandronic acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration.\nMaximum observed plasma concentrations were reached within 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in the\nfasted state and absolute bioavailability was about 0.6%. The extent of absorption is impaired when\ntaken together with food or beverages (other than water). Bioavailability is reduced by about 90%\nwhen ibandronic acid is administered with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability\nseen in fasted subjects. When taken 30 minutes before a meal, the reduction in bioavailability is\napproximately 30%. There is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability provided ibandronic acid is\ntaken 60 minutes before a meal.\n\nBioavailability was reduced by approximately 75% when ibandronic acid tablets were administered 2\nhours after a standard meal. Therefore, it is recommended that the tablets should be taken after an\novernight fast (minimum 6 hours) and fasting should continue for at least 30 minutes after the dose has\nbeen taken (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\nAfter initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine. In\nhumans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 l and the amount of dose reaching\nthe bone is estimated to be 40-50% of the circulating dose. Protein binding in human plasma is\napproximately 87% at therapeutic concentrations, and thus interaction with other medicinal products\ndue to displacement is unlikely.\n\nBiotransformation\nThere is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolized in animals or humans.\n\nElimination\nThe absorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is removed from the circulation via bone absorption\n(estimated to be 40-50%) and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by the kidney. The unabsorbed\nfraction of ibandronic acid is eliminated unchanged in the faeces.\n\nThe range of observed apparent half-lives is broad and dependent on dose and assay sensitivity, but\nthe apparent terminal half-life is generally in the range of 10-60 hours. However, early plasma levels\nfall quickly, reaching 10% of peak values within 3 and 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration\nrespectively.\n\nTotal clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range 84-160 ml/min. Renal\nclearance (about 60 ml/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50-60% of total\nclearance and is related to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total and renal\nclearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone.\n\nThe secretory pathway of renal elimination does not appear to include known acidic or basic transport\nsystems involved in the excretion of other active substances In addition, ibandronic acid does not\ninhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and does not induce the hepatic cytochrome P450\nsystem in rats.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\nGender\nBioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid are similar in both men and women.\n\nRace\nThere is no evidence for clinically relevant interethnic differences between Asians and Caucasians in\nibandronic acid disposition. There are only very few data available on patients with African origin.\n\nRenal impairment\nExposure to ibandronic acid in patients with various degree of renal impairment is related to creatinine\nclearance (CLcr). Subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr \uf0a3 30 mL/min) receiving oral\nadministration of 10 mg ibandronic acid daily for 21 days, had 2-3 fold higher plasma concentrations\n\n\n\n11\n\nthan subjects with normal renal function (CLcr \u226580 mL/min). Total clearance of ibandronic acid was\nreduced to 44 ml/min in the subjects with severe renal impairment compared with 129 mL/min in\nsubjects with normal renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild renal\nimpairment (CLcr \u226550 and <80 mL/min). For patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr \u226530 and\n<50 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) an adjustment in the dose is\nrecommended (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatic impairment (see section 4.2)\nThere are no pharmacokinetic data for ibandronic acid in patients who have hepatic impairment. The\nliver has no significant role in the clearance of ibandronic acid since it is not metabolized but is\ncleared by renal excretion and by uptake into bone. Therefore dosage adjustment is not necessary in\npatients with hepatic impairment. Further, as protein binding of ibandronic acid is approximately 87%\nat therapeutic concentrations, hypoproteinaemia in severe liver disease is unlikely to lead to clinically\nsignificant increases in free plasma concentration.\n\nElderly (see section 4.2)\nIn a multivariate analysis, age was not found to be an independent factor of any of the\npharmacokinetic parameters studied. As renal function decreases with age, this is the only factor to\ntake into consideration (see renal impairment section).\n\nPaediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.1)\nThere are no data on the use of Ibandronic acid Sandoz in patients less than 18 years old.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures sufficiently in excess of the maximum\nhuman exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. As with other bisphosphonates, the kidney\nwas identified to be the primary target organ of systemic toxicity.\n\nMutagenicity/Carcinogenicity:\nNo indication of carcinogenic potential was observed. Tests for genotoxicity revealed no evidence of\ngenetic activity for ibandronic acid.\n\nReproductive toxicity:\nNo evidence of direct foetal toxicity or teratogenic effects was observed for ibandronic acid in\nintravenously or orally treated rats and rabbits. In reproductive studies in rats by the oral route effects on\nfertility consisted of increased preimplantation losses at dose levels of 1 mg/kg/day and higher. In\nreproductive studies in rats by the intravenous route, ibandronic acid decreased sperm counts at doses of\n0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day and decreased fertility in males at 1 mg/kg/day and in females at 1.2 mg/kg/day.\nAdverse effects of ibandronic acid in reproductive toxicity studies in the rat were those expected for this\nclass of medicinal products (bisphosphonates). They include a decreased number of implantation sites,\ninterference with natural delivery (dystocia), an increase in visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter\nsyndrome) and teeth abnormalities in F1 offspring in rats.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,\n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side\n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Ibandronic acid Sandoz is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Ibandronic acid Sandoz\n3. How to take Ibandronic acid Sandoz\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Ibandronic acid Sandoz\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Ibandronic acid Sandoz is and what it is used for\n\nIbandronic acid Sandoz contains the active substance ibandronic acid. This belongs to a group of\nmedicines called bisphosphonates.\n\nIbandronic acid Sandoz tablets is used in adults and prescribed to you if you have breast cancer that\nhas spread to your bones (called \u201cbone metastases\u201d).\n\n\uf0b7 It helps to prevent your bones from breaking (fractures).\n\n\uf0b7 It also helps to prevent other bone problems that may need surgery or radiotherapy.\n\nIbandronic acid Sandoz works by reducing the amount of calcium that is lost from your bones. This\nhelps to stop your bones from getting weaker.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Ibandronic acid Sandoz\n\nDo not take Ibandronic acid Sandoz:\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to ibandronic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine that are\n\nlisted in section 6\n\n\uf0b7 if you have problems with your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus) such as narrowing or difficulty\nswallowing\n\n\uf0b7 if you cannot stand or sit upright for at least one hour (60 minutes) at a time\n\n\uf0b7 if you have or ever had low calcium in your blood.\n\nDo not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or\npharmacist before taking Ibandronic acid Sandoz.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nA side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very\nrarely in the post marketing setting in patients receiving ibandronic acid for cancer-related conditions.\nONJ can also occur after stopping treatment.\n\n\n\n23\n\nIt is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to\ntreat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions\nyou should take.\n\nBefore receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if:\n\u2022 you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a\n\nplanned tooth extraction\n\u2022 you don\u2019t receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time\n\u2022 you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems)\n\u2022 you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone\n\ndisorders)\n\u2022 you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone)\n\u2022 you have cancer.\n\nYour doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Ibandronic\nacid Sandoz.\n\nWhile being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and\nreceive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you\nare under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor\nabout your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Ibandronic acid\nSandoz.\n\nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth\nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of\nosteonecrosis of the jaw.\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ibandronic acid Sandoz\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to any other bisphosphonates\n\n\uf0b7 if you have any swallowing or digestion problems\n\n\uf0b7 if you have high or low blood levels of vitamin D or any other minerals\n\n\uf0b7 if you have kidney problems\n\nIrritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) often with symptoms of\nsevere pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting\nmay occur, especially if you do not drink a full glass of water and/or if you lie down within an hour of\ntaking Ibandronic acid Sandoz. If you develop these symptoms, stop taking Ibandronic acid Sandoz\nand tell your doctor straight away (see sections 3 and 4).\n\nChildren and adolescents\nIbandronic acid Sandoz should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Ibandronic acid Sandoz\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other\nmedicines. This is because Ibandronic acid Sandoz can affect the way some other medicines work.\nAlso some other medicines can affect the way Ibandronic acid Sandoz works.\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\uf0b7 supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium\n\n\uf0b7 acetylsalicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines called \u201cNSAIDs\u201d, such as\nibuprofen or naproxen. This is because NSAIDs and Ibandronic acid Sandoz can both irritate\nyour stomach and gut\n\n\uf0b7 a type of antibiotic injection called \u201caminoglycoside\u201d such as gentamicin. This is because\naminoglycosides and Ibandronic acid Sandoz can both lower the amount of calcium in your\nblood.\n\n\n\n24\n\nTaking medicines that reduce stomach acid such as cimetidine and ranitidine, may slightly increase the\neffects of Ibandronic acid Sandoz.\n\nIbandronic acid Sandoz with food and drink\nDo not take Ibandronic acid Sandoz with food or any other drinks except water as the medicine is less\neffective if it is taken with food or drink (see section 3).\n\nTake Ibandronic acid Sandoz at least 6 hours after you last had anything to eat, drink or any other\nmedicines or supplements (e.g. products containing calcium (milk), aluminium, magnesium and iron)\nexcept water. After taking your tablet, wait at least 30 minutes. Then you can have your first food and\ndrink, and take any medicines or supplements (see section 3).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nDo not take Ibandronic acid Sandoz if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant or if you are breast-\nfeeding.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\nYou can drive and use machines as it\u2019s expected that Ibandronic acid Sandoz has no or negligible\neffect on your ability to drive and use machines. Talk to your doctor first if you want to drive, use\nmachine or tools.\n\nIbandronic acid Sandoz contains lactose\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you cannot tolerate or digest some sugars (e.g. if you have a\ngalactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or have problems with glucose-galactose\nabsorption), talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take Ibandronic acid Sandoz\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist\nif you are not sure.\n\nTake your tablet at least 6 hours after you last had anything to eat, drink or any other medicines or\nsupplements except water. Water with a high concentration of calcium should not be used. If there is\nconcern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard water), it is advised to use\nbottled water with a low mineral content.\n\nYour doctor may do regular blood tests while you are taking Ibandronic acid Sandoz. This is to check\nthat you are being given the right amount of medicine.\n\nTaking this medicine\nIt is important that you take Ibandronic acid Sandoz at the right time and in the right way. This is\nbecause it can cause irritation, inflammation or ulcers in your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus).\n\nYou can help stop this happening by doing the following:\n\n\uf0b7 Take your tablet as soon as you get up for the day before having your first food, drink, any\nmedicine or supplements.\n\n\uf0b7 Take your tablet with a full glass of water only (about 200 mL). Do not take your tablet with\nany drink other than water\n\n\uf0b7 Swallow the tablet whole. Do not chew, suck or crush the tablet. Do not let the tablet dissolve in\nyour mouth.\n\n\uf0b7 After taking your tablet, wait at least 30 minutes. Then you can have your first food and drink,\nand take any medicines or supplements.\n\n\n\n25\n\n\uf0b7 Stay upright (sitting or standing) while taking your tablet and for the next hour (60 minutes).\nOtherwise, some of the medicine could leak back into your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus).\n\nHow much to take\nThe usual dose of Ibandronic acid Sandoz is one tablet each day. If you have moderate kidney\nproblems, your doctor may reduce your dose to one tablet every other day. If you have severe kidney\nproblems, your doctor may reduce your dose to one tablet each week.\n\nIf you take more Ibandronic acid Sandoz than you should\nIf you take too many tablets talk to a doctor or go to hospital straight away. Drink a full glass of milk\nbefore you go. Do not make yourself sick. Do not lie down.\n\nIf you forget to take Ibandronic acid Sandoz\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you are taking a tablet each day, skip the\nmissed dose completely. Then carry on as usual the next day. If you are taking a tablet every other day\nor once a week, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\nIf you stop taking Ibandronic acid Sandoz\nKeep taking Ibandronic acid Sandoz for as long as your doctor tells you. This is because the medicine\nwill only work if it is taken all the time.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nTalk to a nurse or a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects\nyou may need urgent medical treatment:\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 feeling sick, heartburn and discomfort in swallowing (inflammation of your gullet/ food pipe)\n\nUncommon (may affect less than 1 in 100 people):\n\uf0b7 severe stomach pain.

allergic to ibandronic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine that are listed in section 6 if you have problems with your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus) such as narrowing or difficulty swallowing if you cannot stand or sit upright for at least one hour (60 minutes) at a time if you have or ever had low calcium in your blood. do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ibandronic acid sandoz. warnings and precautions a side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (onj) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very rarely in the post marketing setting in patients receiving ibandronic acid for cancer-related conditions. onj can also occur after stopping treatment. it is important to try and prevent onj developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. in order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions you should take. before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if: you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a planned tooth extraction you don't receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems) you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders) you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) you have cancer. your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with ibandronic acid sandoz. while being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. if you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. if you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with ibandronic acid sandoz. contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ibandronic acid sandoz if you are allergic to any other bisphosphonates if you have any swallowing or digestion problems if you have high or low blood levels of vitamin d or any other minerals if you have kidney problems irritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) often with symptoms of severe pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting may occur, especially if you do not drink a full glass of water and/or if you lie down within an hour of taking ibandronic acid sandoz. if you develop these symptoms, stop taking ibandronic acid sandoz and tell your doctor straight away (see sections 3 and 4). children and adolescents ibandronic acid sandoz should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. other medicines and ibandronic acid sandoz tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. this is because ibandronic acid sandoz can affect the way some other medicines work. also some other medicines can affect the way ibandronic acid sandoz works. in particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium acetylsalicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines called \"nsaids\", such as ibuprofen or naproxen. this is because nsaids and ibandronic acid sandoz can both irritate your stomach and gut a type of antibiotic injection called \"aminoglycoside\" such as gentamicin. this is because aminoglycosides and ibandronic acid sandoz can both lower the amount of calcium in your blood. taking medicines that reduce stomach acid such as cimetidine and ranitidine, may slightly increase the effects of ibandronic acid sandoz. ibandronic acid sandoz with food and drink do not take ibandronic acid sandoz with food or any other drinks except water as the medicine is less effective if it is taken with food or drink (see section 3). take ibandronic acid sandoz at least 6 hours after you last had anything to eat, drink or any other medicines or supplements (e.g. products containing calcium (milk), aluminium, magnesium and iron) except water. after taking your tablet, wait at least 30 minutes. then you can have your first food and drink, and take any medicines or supplements (see section 3). pregnancy and breast-feeding do not take ibandronic acid sandoz if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant or if you are breast- feeding. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. driving and using machines you can drive and use machines as it's expected that ibandronic acid sandoz has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive and use machines. talk to your doctor first if you want to drive, use machine or tools. ibandronic acid sandoz contains lactose if you have been told by your doctor that you cannot tolerate or digest some sugars (e.g. if you have a galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or have problems with glucose-galactose absorption), talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ibandronic acid sandoz", "Type":

had anything to eat, drink or any other medicines or supplements except water. water with a high concentration of calcium should not be used. if there is concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard water), it is advised to use bottled water with a low mineral content. your doctor may do regular blood tests while you are taking ibandronic acid sandoz. this is to check that you are being given the right amount of medicine. taking this medicine it is important that you take ibandronic acid sandoz at the right time and in the right way. this is because it can cause irritation, inflammation or ulcers in your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus). you can help stop this happening by doing the following: take your tablet as soon as you get up for the day before having your first food, drink, any medicine or supplements. take your tablet with a full glass of water only (about 200 ml). do not take your tablet with any drink other than water swallow the tablet whole. do not chew, suck or crush the tablet. do not let the tablet dissolve in your mouth. after taking your tablet, wait at least 30 minutes. then you can have your first food and drink, and take any medicines or supplements. stay upright (sitting or standing) while taking your tablet and for the next hour (60 minutes). otherwise, some of the medicine could leak back into your food pipe/gullet (oesophagus). how much to take the usual dose of ibandronic acid sandoz is one tablet each day. if you have moderate kidney problems, your doctor may reduce your dose to one tablet every other day. if you have severe kidney problems, your doctor may reduce your dose to one tablet each week. if you take more ibandronic acid sandoz than you should if you take too many tablets talk to a doctor or go to hospital straight away. drink a full glass of milk before you go. do not make yourself sick. do not lie down. if you forget to take ibandronic acid sandoz do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you are taking a tablet each day, skip the missed dose completely. then carry on as usual the next day. if you are taking a tablet every other day or once a week, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. if you stop taking ibandronic acid sandoz keep taking ibandronic acid sandoz for as long as your doctor tells you. this is because the medicine will only work if it is taken all the time. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ibandronic acid sandoz", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
