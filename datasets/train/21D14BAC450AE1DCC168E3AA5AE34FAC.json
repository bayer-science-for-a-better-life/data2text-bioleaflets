NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNeuraceq 300 MBq/mL solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of solution for injection contains 300 MBq of florbetaben (18F) at the date and time of \ncalibration. \nThe activity per vial ranges from 300 MBq to 3000 MBq at the date and time of calibration. \n \nFluorine (18F) decays to stable oxygen (18O) with a half-life of approximately 110 minutes by emitting \na positron radiation of 634 keV, followed by photonic annihilation radiation of 511 keV. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \nThis medicinal product contains up to 1.2 g of ethanol and up to 33 mg of sodium per dose (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.  \n \nNeuraceq is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of \n\u03b2-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are \nbeing evaluated for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive impairment. Neuraceq \nshould be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation.  \n \nA negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD. For \nthe limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nA PET scan with florbetaben (18F) should be requested by clinicians experienced in the clinical \nmanagement of neurodegenerative disorders. \n \nNeuraceq images should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images \nwith florbetaben (18F). A recent co-registered computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance \n(MR) imaging of the patient to get a fused PET-CT or PET-MR image is recommended in cases of \nuncertainty about the location of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border in the PET scan (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nPosology \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nThe recommended activity for an adult is 300 MBq florbetaben (18F). The maximum dose should not \nexceed 360 MBq and not fall below 240 MBq at time of administration. The volume of Neuraceq to \nbe injected can be from 0.5 to 10 mL in order to provide the target activity of 300 MBq at the time of \nintravenous administration. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is recommended based on age. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nCareful consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation \nexposure is possible in these patients (see section 4.4). \n \nExtensive dose-range and adjustment studies with the medicinal product in normal and special \npopulations have not been performed. The pharmacokinetics of florbetaben (18F) in patients with renal \nor hepatic impairment has not been characterised.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Neuraceq in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \nNeuraceq is for intravenous use and for multidose use.  \n \nThe activity of florbetaben (18F) has to be measured with an activimeter (dose calibrator) immediately \nprior to injection.  \n \nNeuraceq should not be diluted. \n \nThe dose is administered by intravenous slow bolus injection (6 sec/mL) followed by a flush of \napproximately 10 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure full \ndelivery of the dose. If the injection volume ranges between 0.5 and 1 mL, only syringes of an \nappropriate size (1 mL) should be used and the syringe needs to be flushed out with sodium chloride \nsolution (see section 12).  \n \nThe injection of florbetaben (18F) must be intravenous in order to avoid irradiation as a result of local \nextravasation, as well as imaging artefacts. \n \nImage acquisition \nA 20-minute PET image should be acquired starting at approximately 90 minutes after intravenous \ninjection of florbetaben (18F).  \n \nPatients should be supine with the head positioned to centre the brain, including the cerebellum, in the \nPET scanner field of view. Reducing head movement with tape or other flexible head restraints may \nbe employed. Reconstruction should include attenuation correction with resulting transaxial pixel \nsizes between 2.0 and 3.0 mm. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIndividual benefit/risk justification \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nFor each patient, the radiation exposure must be justified by the likely benefit. The activity \nadministered should, in every case, be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required \ndiagnostic information. \n \nRenal impairment and hepatic impairment \nCareful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation \nexposure is possible. Florbetaben (18F) is excreted primarily through the hepatobiliary system and \npatients with hepatic impairment have the potential of increased radiation exposure (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nFor information on the use in the paediatric population, see sections 4.2 or 5.1. \n \nInterpretation of Neuraceq images \nNeuraceq images should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images \nwith florbetaben (18F). A negative scan indicates sparse or no density of cortical \u03b2-amyloid plaques. A \npositive scan indicates moderate to frequent density. Image interpretation errors in the estimation of \nbrain \u03b2-amyloid neuritic plaque density, including false negatives and false positives, have been \nobserved. \n \nPET images are read in a transaxial orientation using a grey scale. The reader should compare the \ncortical grey matter signal intensity to the maximum white matter signal intensity. The images should \nbe viewed in a systematic manner (Figure 1) starting at the level of cerebellum and scrolling up \nthrough the lateral temporal and frontal lobes, then to the area of the posterior cingulate cortex and \nprecuneus, and finally to the parietal lobe.  \n \nInterpretation of the images is made visually comparing the activity in cortical grey matter with \nactivity in adjacent cortical white matter. Each of these brain regions, the lateral temporal, frontal, \nposterior cingulate, precuneus, and parietal lobes should be systematically visually assessed and \nscored according to the regional cortical tracer uptake (RCTU) score (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Definitions of regional cortical tracer uptake (RCTU) \n \nRCTU score Condition for assessment \n\n1 (No tracer uptake) \nTracer uptake (i.e., signal intensity) in grey matter in the \nregion is lower than in white matter. \n\n2 (Moderate tracer uptake) \n\nSmaller area(s) of tracer uptake equal to or higher than \nthat present in white matter: extending beyond the white \nmatter rim to the outer cortical margin involving the \nmajority of the slices within the respective region. \n\n3 (Pronounced tracer uptake) \n\nA large confluent area of tracer uptake equal to or higher \nthan that present in white matter extending beyond the \nwhite matter rim to the outer cortical margin and \ninvolving the entire region including the majority of slices \nwithin the respective region. \n\nNote: For a score of tracer uptake in the cortex, the finding should have been present in the majority of \nthe slices within the region in question. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nFigure 1: Neuraceq PET cases showing examples of negative florbetaben (18F) PET scan (top \nrow) and positive scan (bottom row).  \n \n\n \n \nThe overall decision of the visual PET scan assessment is subject-based and based on a binary \noutcome as \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2018. A subject is classified as \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d based on the \nbrain amyloid plaque load (BAPL) score (Table 2) which is derived from RCTU scores in the four \nbrain regions (Table 1). \n \nTable 2: Definitions of brain amyloid plaque load (BAPL) \n \nAssessment BAPL score Rule for assessment \n\nNegative scan \n\n1 Scan without beta-amyloid \ndeposition \n\nRCTU score 1 in each of the  4 brain \nregions (lateral temporal lobes, frontal \nlobes, posterior cingulate/precuneus, \nparietal lobes) \n\nPositive scan \n\n2 Scan with moderate \nbeta-amyloid deposition  \n\nRCTU score 2 in any or all of the \n4 brain regions and no score 3 in these \n4 brain regions \n\n3 Scan with pronounced \nbeta-amyloid deposition \n\nRCTU score 3 at least in one of 4 brain \nregions  \n\n \nLimitations of use \nA positive scan does not independently establish a diagnosis of AD or other cognitive disorder since \nneuritic plaque deposition in grey matter may be present in asymptomatic elderly and some \nneurodegenerative dementias (AD, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia).  \n \nFor the limitations of use in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), see section 5.1.  \n \nThe efficacy of florbetaben (18F) for predicting development of AD or monitoring response to therapy \nhas not been established (see section 5.1). \n \nSome scans may be difficult to interpret due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or \nimage blurs, which could lead to interpretation errors. For cases in which there is uncertainty about \nthe location of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border on the PET scan, and a co-registered \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nrecent CT or MR image is available, the interpreter should examine the fused PET-CT or PET-MR \nimage to clarify the relationship of the PET radioactivity and the grey matter anatomy. \n \nIncreased uptake has been identified in extracerebral structures such as face, scalp and bone in some \ncases. Residual activity in the midsagittal sinus can be sometimes observed (see section 5.2).  \n \nAfter the procedure \nClose contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the initial 24 hours \nfollowing the injection. \n \nSpecific warnings \nThis medicinal product contains up to 33 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 1.6% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nThis medicinal product contains 15 vol % ethanol (alcohol), i.e. up to 1.2 g per dose, equivalent to \n30 mL beer or 12.5 mL wine per dose.  \n \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism. \n \nTo be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as \npatients with liver disease, or epilepsy. \n \nFor precautions with respect to environmental hazard, see section 6.6. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo in vivo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nIn radioligand binding assays using a broad panel of animal and human receptors, ion channels and \ntransporters no significant binding was found. \n \nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes did not indicate any potential to inhibit the cytochrome \nP450 enzyme system. \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \nWhen an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it \nis important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should \nbe assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the \nwoman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using \nionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient.  \n \nPregnancy \nRadionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. \nOnly essential investigations should therefore be carried out during pregnancy, when the likely benefit \nfar exceeds the risk incurred by the mother and foetus. \nNo studies have been conducted in pregnant women. No animal studies have been conducted to \ninvestigate the reproductive effects in florbetaben (18F) (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether florbetaben (18F) is excreted in human milk. Before administering \nradiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding consideration should be given to the \npossibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breast-feeding, \nand to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nactivity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be \ninterrupted for 24 hours and the expressed feeds discarded. \n \nClose contact with infants should be restricted during the initial 24 hours following injection. \n \nFertility \nNo fertility studies have been performed.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNeuraceq has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe overall safety profile of Neuraceq is based on data from 1,295 administrations of Neuraceq to \n1,077 subjects and 12 subjects who received vehicle. Repeat dosing in yearly intervals showed that \nthere was no difference in safety profile after first, second or third dosing. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following convention: very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); \nrare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness.  \n \nTable 3: List of adverse reactions \nSystem Organ Class Common Uncommon \n\nNervous  system disorders  Neuralgia \nHeadache \nBurning sensation \nTremor \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension \nFlushing \nHaematoma \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Diarrhoea \nNausea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  Hepatic function abnormal \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  Toxic skin eruption \nRash \nHyperhidrosis \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\n Pain in extremity \nLimb discomfort \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site pain \nInjection/application site \nerythema \n\nPyrexia \nFatigue \nFeeling hot \nVessel puncture site pain \nCatheter site pain \nInjection site haematoma \nInjection site irritation \nPuncture site reaction \nInjection site discomfort \nInjection site warmth \n\nInvestigations   Blood creatinine increased  \n\n \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. As the effective dose is about 5.8 mSv when the maximum recommended activity \nof 300 MBq of florbetaben (18F) is administered, these adverse reactions are expected to occur with a \nlow probability. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDue to the small quantity of florbetaben (18F) in each dose, overdose is not expected to result in \npharmacological effects. In the event of administration of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to \nthe patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from \nthe body by frequent micturition and defecation. It might be helpful to estimate the effective dose that \nwas applied. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, central nervous system; \nATC code: V09AX06  \n \nMechanism of action \nFlorbetaben (18F) binds to \u03b2-amyloid neuritic plaques in the brain. In vitro, florbetaben (18F) shows \nnanomolar binding affinity to synthetic \u03b2-amyloid fibrils and to AD brain homogenate. In addition, \nbinding of florbetaben (18F) to \u03b2-amyloid plaques in post-mortem AD brain sections was demonstrated \nby autoradiography and supported by immunohistochemistry or Bielschowsky stain.  \nIn vivo, quantitative correlation was not assessed in end-of-life patients between florbetaben (18F) \nuptake in cortical grey matter and the beta-amyloid deposition in autopsied samples. The in vivo \nbinding of florbetaben (18F) to other amyloid structures or other brain structures or receptors remains \nunknown.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \nAt the low chemical concentrations present in Neuraceq, florbetaben (18F) does not have any \ndetectable pharmacodynamic activity. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n \n\nIn completed clinical trials, uptake of florbetaben (18F) in 7 predefined cortical areas of the brain \n(frontal, parietal, lateral and medial temporal, occipital, caudate, posterior cingulate/precuneus cortex, \nand anterior cingulate gyrus) and cerebellar cortex was measured quantitatively using standardised \nuptake values (SUV). Cortical SUV ratios (SUVRs, relative to cerebellar cortex) are higher in AD \npatients compared with those of healthy volunteer subjects. \n \nClinical efficacy \nA pivotal study in 31 end-of-life patients was aimed at establishing the diagnostic performance of \nflorbetaben (18F) to detect the cortical neuritic plaque density (no or sparse vs. moderate or frequent) \nas established by the CERAD criteria. The PET results were compared with the maximal neuritic \nplaque density measured on sections of middle frontal gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyri, \ninferior parietal lobe, hippocampus and other brain regions at the patient\u2019s autopsy. The cognitive \nstatus of the subjects could not be determined reliably. In all 31 subjects, a blinded visual \nsubject-level PET reading by 3 blinded readers resulted in a majority read sensitivity of \n100% (95% CI: 80.5-100%) and specificity 85.7% (95% CI: 67.4 - 100%). In a post-hoc analysis \nsensitivity and specificity of the majority read of the visual subject-level PET reading vs \nhistopathology in a larger population (74 patients) was 97.9% (95% CI: 93.8 - 100%) and \n88.9% (95% CI: 77-100%). \nSensitivity and specificity to estimate beta-amyloid deposition of florbetaben (18F) was further \ninvestigated in one additional study, in which a different set of 5 electronically-trained blinded readers \ninterpreted images from 54 subjects followed to autopsy in the pivotal study. The histopathology \ncriteria did not match the CERAD criteria. The results were lower than the results obtained in the \npivotal trial: a sensitivity range between 77.5% to 90% and specificity range between 62.5-85.7%. \nInter-rater agreement using Fleiss\u2019 kappa values ranged from 0.68 to 0.87. Comparing the results of \nPET scan reading with the histopathology assessment collected for all subjects (same as used for the \noriginal pivotal study and its post-hoc analysis), the majority read sensitivity and specificity were \n100% (95%CI: 89.4-100%) and 71.4% (95%CI: 52.1-90.8%), respectively. \n \nIn a longitudinal study, 45 subjects clinically diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), \nunderwent baseline florbetaben (18F) PET scans, and were followed for 24 months to evaluate the \nrelationship between florbetaben (18F) imaging and changes in diagnostic status. 29 (64.4%) of MCI \npatients were positive by florbetaben (18F) PET scan. At the 24-month follow-up, 19 (42.2%) \nconverted to clinical AD. Of the 29 MCI subjects who had a positive PET scan, 19 (65.5%) were \nclassified clinically as converted to clinical AD after 24 months compared to 0 (0%) of 16 who had a \nnegative scan. Sensitivity of florbetaben (18F) scan to show the MCI conversion rate to AD in \n19 converters was 100%, specificity in 26 non-converters was 61.5% (95% CI: 42.8-80.2%) and \npositive likelihood ratio was 2.60 (1.60-4.23). The design of this study does not allow estimating the \nrisk of MCI progression to clinical AD. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nflorbetaben (18F) in all subsets of the paediatric population as the disease or condition for which the \nspecific medicinal product is intended only occurs in adult population, and the specific medicinal \nproduct does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for paediatric \npatients (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution  \nAfter intravenous bolus injection a radioactivity concentration of 2-3% injected dose/L is achieved in \narterial plasma 10 minutes after injection. \n \nFlorbetaben (18F) is highly bound to plasma proteins (>98.5%).  \n \nOrgan uptake \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nUptake of radioactivity in the brain is rapid, reaching about 6% of injected radioactivity at 10 minutes \npost injection. \n \nHealthy controls show relatively low levels of florbetaben (18F) retention in cortex. The highest level \nof uptake is in pons and other white matter regions. In AD subjects, cortical regions and striatal \nregions show significantly greater uptake compared to controls. In AD subjects, as in controls, there is \nhigh retention in pons and other white matter areas.  \n \nUptake has also been identified in some cases in extracerebral structures such as face, scalp and bone. \nThe reason for this accumulation is unknown, but maybe due to accumulation of florbetaben (18F) or \nto any of its radioactive metabolites, or to blood radioactivity. Residual activity in the midsagittal \nsinus can be sometimes observed likely due to the presence of tracer in the blood pool.  \n \nThe biophysical basis of the white matter retention of florbetaben (18F) in the living human brain \ncannot be definitively explained. It is hypothesised that unspecific binding of the radiopharmaceutical \nto the lipid-containing myelin sheath may contribute to white matter retention. \n \nElimination \nFlorbetaben (18F) is eliminated from plasma of AD patients with a mean biological half-life of \nabout 1 hour. No radioactivity could be measured in blood at about 4 hours post injection.  \nBased on in vitro investigations florbetaben (18F) is metabolised predominantly \nby CYP2J2 and CYP4F2.  \n \nAt 12 hours post-injection, up to approximately 30% of the injected radioactivity is excreted with \nurine. Time points beyond that time frame did not allow for further quantitation of activity in urine. \n \nHalf-life \nFluorine (18F) has a physical half-life of 110 minutes.  \nAt 12 hours post injection 98.93% of the activity is decayed, at 24 hours post injection 99.99 % of the \nactivity is decayed. \n \nRenal/hepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been characterised. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. The potential toxicity of 28 days of \nrepeated intravenous injections of florbetaben (18F) was tested in rats and dogs, and the NOAEL was \nfound to be at least 20 times the maximum human dose. \n \nChronic studies and carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out, since the medicinal product is \nnot intended for regular or continuous administration.  \n \nStudies on reproduction toxicity have not been performed.  \n \n \n6.

Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the \nregulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation.  \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and \npharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. \n \nIf the integrity of the vial is compromised it should not be used. \n \nAdministration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the \nmedicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. \n \nThe administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons (including pregnant \nhealthcare professionals) from external radiation or contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. \nRadiation protection precautions in accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n7.

For an administered activity of 360 MBq the typical radiation \ndose to the target organ (brain) is 4.5 mGy. \n \nFor an administered activity of 360 MBq the typical radiation doses delivered to the critical organs, \ngallbladder, urinary bladder, upper large intestine wall, lower large intestine wall, small intestine and \nliver are 49.3 mGy, 25.0 mGy, 13.8 mGy, 12.6 mGy, 11.3 mGy and 13.9 mGy, respectively. \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nMethod of preparation \nThe package must be checked before use and the activity measured using an activimeter. \n \nWithdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened before \ndisinfecting the stopper, the solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single dose syringe \nfitted with suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised \nautomated application system. If the integrity of the vial is compromised, the medicinal product \nshould not be used. \n \nFlorbetaben (18F) should not be diluted. \n \nThe dose is administered by intravenous slow bolus injection (6 sec/mL) followed by a flush of \napproximately 10 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure full \ndelivery of the dose. If the injection volume ranges between 0.5 and 1 mL, only syringes of an \nappropriate size (1 mL) should be used and the syringe needs to be flushed out with sodium chloride \nsolution.  \n \nThe injection of florbetaben (18F) must be intravenous in order to avoid irradiation as a result of local \nextravasation, as well as imaging artefacts. \n \nQuality control \nThe solution should be inspected visually prior to use.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nNeuraceq 300 MBq/mL solution for injection \nflorbetaben (18F) \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \n\nprocedure.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.  \n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Neuraceq is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before Neuraceq is used \n3. How Neuraceq will be used \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How Neuraceq is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What Neuraceq is and what it is used for \n \nThis medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. \n \nNeuraceq contains the active substance florbetaben (18F).  \n \nNeuraceq is given to people with memory problems so that doctors can perform a type of brain scan, \ncalled a PET scan. A Neuraceq PET scan, along with other brain function tests, can help your doctor \ndetermine whether or not you may have \u03b2-amyloid plaques in your brain. This medicine is intended \nfor adults only.  \n \nYou should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. \n \nThe use of Neuraceq does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the \nnuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit of this procedure with the \nradiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to radiation. \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before Neuraceq is used \n \nNeuraceq must not be used: \n- if you are allergic to florbetaben (18F) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Neuraceq if you: \n- have kidney problems \n- have liver problems \n- are pregnant or think you may be pregnant  \n- are breast-feeding \n \nChildren and adolescents \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nNeuraceq is not intended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Neuraceq \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images from the PET scan. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour nuclear medicine doctor for advise before you are given this medicine. \n \nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Neuraceq if there is a possibility \nyou might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. When in doubt, it \nis important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  \n \nPregnant \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will only give this medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected \nwhich would outweigh the risks.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nYou must stop breast-feeding for 24 hours after the injection. Express breast milk during this period \nand discard the breast milk you have expressed. Resuming breast-feeding should be in agreement with \nthe nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nNeuraceq has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nNeuraceq contains ethanol and sodium ascorbate \n- This medicine contains 15 vol % ethanol (alcohol), i.e. up to 1.2 g per dose, equivalent to \n\n30 mL beer or 12.5 mL wine per dose.  \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism, and is also to be taken into account in pregnant or \nbreast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease, or \nepilepsy. \n\n- This medicine contains up to 33 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each \ndose. This is equivalent to 1.6% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium \nfor an adult. \n \n\n3.  How Neuraceq will be used \n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products.  \nNeuraceq will only be used in specially controlled areas. This medicine will only be handled and \ngiven to you by professionals who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take \nspecial care for the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions. \n \n \nDose \nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the amount of Neuraceq to be \nused in your case. It will be the smallest amount necessary to get the desired information. \n \nThe quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult is 300 MBq (megabecquerel, the \nunit used to express radioactivity). \n \nAdministration of Neuraceq and conduct of the procedure \nNeuraceq is given as an injection into your vein (intravenous injection) followed by a flush of sodium \nchloride solution to ensure full delivery of the dose.  \n \nOne injection is sufficient to carry out the scan that your doctor needs. \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \nDuration of the procedure \nA brain scan is usually taken 90 minutes after Neuraceq is given.  \nYour nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure.  \n \nAfter administration of Neuraceq, you should: \nAvoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for 24 hours following the \ninjection. \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after \nreceiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. \n \nIf you have been given more Neuraceq than you should \nAn overdose is unlikely since you will only receive a single dose of Neuraceq precisely controlled by \nthe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure.  \n \nHowever, in the case of an overdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment. In particular, the \nnuclear medicine doctor in charge of the procedure may provide ways to increase the passing of urine \nand stools in order to help remove radioactivity from your body. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor \nwho supervises the procedure. \n \n \n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nPossible side effects include: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Injection site reactions: injection site pain, redness of the skin at injection site (injection / \n\napplication site erythema) \n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- Burning sensation, headache, neuralgia (intense, typically intermittent pain along the course of \n\na nerve), tremor (an involuntary quivering movement) \n- Vessels: flushing (sudden reddening of the face and/or neck), haematoma (a bruise, a black and \n\nblue mark), hypotension (low blood pressure) \n- Stomach: diarrhea, nausea (feeling sick) \n- Liver: abnormal liver function \n- Skin: hyperhidrosis (excessive sweat), rash, toxic skin eruption (acute skin affections with \n\nmeasles-type erythema of the skin, potentially including blisters and ulcerations) \n- Muscles and bones: limb discomfort, pain in extremity \n- Injection site conditions: injection site irritation, pain and discomfort around the injection site, \n\ninjection site haematoma (a bruise, a black and blue mark at injection site), injection site \nwarmth, tiredness, feeling hot, pyrexia (raised body temperature, a fever) \n\n- Abnormal blood test: increased blood creatinine levels (reduced kidney function) \n \nThis radiopharmaceutical will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation associated with the least risk \nof cancer and hereditary abnormalities.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects please talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5.  How Neuraceq is stored \n \nYou will not have to store this medicine.

the active substance florbetaben (18f). neuraceq is given to people with memory problems so that doctors can perform a type of brain scan, called a pet scan. a neuraceq pet scan, along with other brain function tests, can help your doctor determine whether or not you may have \u03b2-amyloid plaques in your brain. this medicine is intended for adults only. you should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. the use of neuraceq does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical
